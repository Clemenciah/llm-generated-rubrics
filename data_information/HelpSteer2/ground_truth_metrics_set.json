    "name": "Succinct vs. Verbose Language",

    "scale": "0-4",
    "instruction": "\n    5. Succinctness/Verbosity\n    The goal here is to place the response on a spectrum from the most short, crisp answers, to the most lengthy, detailed, and/or wordy answers under the context of what a user is expecting as a response to the prompt. For example, if the prompt asks the model a yes or no question and the model simply responds \u201cyes\u201d the answer is succinct. But if the model responds \u201cyes\u201d, restates the question worded as an answer, and explains why it gave that answer, the answer is verbose. Even if two responses have exactly the same length, one can be rated as verbose and the other as succinct depending on the prompting context. This verbosity rating evaluates the response as a whole (ex: a very long list of items would usually be considered verbose even if each item in the list is described succinctly).\n    \u2022 4 (Verbose)\u2013 The response is particularly lengthy, wordy, and/or extensive with extra details given what the prompt requested from the assistant model. The response can be verbose regardless of if the length is due to repetition and incoherency or if it is due to rich and insightful detail.\n    \u2022 3 (Moderately Long)\u2013 The response is on the longer side but could still have more added to it before it is considered fully detailed or rambling.\n    \u2022 2 (Average Length)\u2013The response isn\u2019t especially long or short given what the prompt is asking of the model. The length is adequate for conveying a full response but isn\u2019t particularly wordy nor particularly concise.\n    \u2022 1 (Pretty Short)\u2013 The response is on the shorter side but could still have words, details, and/or text removed before it\u2019s at a bare minimum of what the response is trying to convey.\n    \u2022 0 (Succinct)\u2013 The response is short, to the point, and the most concise it can be. No additional information is provided outside of what is requested by the prompt (regardless of if the information or response itself is incorrect, hallucinated, or misleading. A response that gives an incorrect answer can still be succinct.).\n    "
