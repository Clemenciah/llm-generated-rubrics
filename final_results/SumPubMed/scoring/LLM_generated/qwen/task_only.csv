"BACKGROUND
genotype information generated by individual and international efforts carries the promise of revolutionizing disease studies and the association of phenotypes with alleles and haplotypes.
given the enormous amounts of public genotype data, tools for analyzing, interpreting and visualizing these data sets are of critical importance to researchers.
in past works we have developed the following analysis algorithms:
<dig>  gerbil  <cit>  – an algorithm for simultaneously phasing genotypes into haplotypes and block partitioning.
the algorithm is based on a stochastic model for recombination-poor regions , in which haplotypes are generated from a small number of core haplotypes, allowing for mutations, rare recombinations and errors.
the genotype phasing and block partitioning is solved by an expectation-maximization algorithm.
gerbil accepts genotype data as input and outputs the phased genotypes for each individual, the block structure of the entire population and the common haplotypes in each block.
as part of the algorithm, gerbil also accurately completes missing data according to the common haplotypes found.
gerbil was shown to be quick and accurate even for many hundreds of individuals  <cit> .
<dig>  stampa  <cit>  – an algorithm for tag snp selection.
the algorithm finds a set of tag snps with maximal prediction accuracy.
the prediction accuracy of a set of tag snps is the expected accuracy of predicting untyped snps, given the tag snps.
dynamic programming is used in order to efficiently find the set of tag snps.
halperin et.
al tested stampa on many different genotype datasets from different sources, and showed that it finds tag snps with considerably better prediction ability than two other state-of-the-art tag snp selection algorithms  <cit> .
both gerbil and stampa were available until now only as batch executables.
in this work we introduce gevalt .
gevalt  is an integrated software providing easy access to the gerbil and stampa algorithms as well as to some other tools for genotype analysis.
gevalt is based on haploview version  <dig>   <cit>  and it maintains the user-friendly interface and strong visualization capabilities of haploview, as well as its other functionalities, including computation of marker quality statistics and ld information.
implementation
gevalt is implemented in java based on the open source code of haploview version  <dig> .
the analysis algorithms  are implemented in c++.
both linux and windows versions of gevalt are available for download, as well as the java source code.
RESULTS
gevalt accepts input in a variety of formats.
genotype data can be loaded as unphased genotypes in the standard linkage format, or as either partially or fully phased chromosomes.
genotype data dumps from the hapmap website  <cit>  can also be loaded.
when using the standard linkage format, the user can specify family structure as well as disease status.
the user can also specify marker information, including name and location.
upon loading a dataset, gevalt first phases the genotypes in the following manner: for data consisting of unrelated individuals, gevalt uses gerbil to phase the genotypes.
for data consisting of two-generation pedigrees, gevalt first creates a set of trios, one per family, where each trio contains the child with least missing data.
in each trio phasing is done, if possible, according to mendelian rules.
then only the children's genotypes are phased using gerbil and each parent's haplotypes are deduced from its child's haplotypes.
gerbil is then run again on the set of the parents' genotypes only to complete the missing data.
the haplotypes of the children that were not included in the trios are deduced from their parents' haplotypes.
after phasing is completed, gevalt generates several displays and option menus including the following:
• phased genotypes: the phased genotypes of each individual are displayed.
different colors are used to indicate alleles phased by gerbil, missing data and mendelian errors .
for data consisting of pedigrees, the phased genotypes are divided into two groups, parents and children, and each group is displayed separately.
• stampa: select tag snps using the stampa algorithm .
the user can specify the desired number of tag snps, and the algorithm finds an optimal set of tag snps and reports its prediction accuracy.
the user can add or remove tag snps from the set manually and gevalt recalculates the prediction accuracy of the new set.
• individual stats: summary statistics for each individual are displayed .
these include the percentage of missing genotypes, the percentage of heterozygous markers, the percentage of minor alleles and a tally of mendelian inheritance errors.
all of haploview's displays and option menus are available.
see  <cit>  for a full description of these features.
in addition, the following changes and extensions are introduced:
• association: gevalt contains a faster implementation of the permutation test in c++ instead of java.
the new implementation runs about  <dig> times faster than the java implementation in haploview.
in the haplotype associations tab, a p-value is calculated for each block and for each haplotype .
• ld plot: the ld between each pair of snps can be calculated using either the phased or the unphased genotypes .
the block structure displayed by default is that found by gerbil.
the user can still employ any of haploview's block identification methods or select blocks manually.
markers that were chosen as tag snps in the stampa tab are highlighted in this display.
• haplotypes: the common haplotypes in each block are computed based on the gerbil solution.
• check markers: phasing by gerbil is done only for the set of picked markers.
whenever the set of picked markers changes, gevalt recalculates the phasing, and all displays are updated accordingly.
each of these displays and option menus is shown on a separate tab, allowing the user to move from one to the next.
interactive modifications made by the user in any panel are reflected in all the others.
the information on each panel can also be exported to a png image file or to a text file.
additionally, the program has a command-line mode, which allows the user to run all the analyses without opening the gui on one or more files at once.
the running time of gevalt is dominated primarily by that of gerbil and stampa .
all other operations, such as parameter adjustments and display changes, are done with no noticeable delay even for data sets with hundreds of markers and hundreds of individuals.
gerbil can currently handle up to  <dig> markers, while stampa can handle thousands of markers.
both algorithms can handle thousands of individuals.
to the best of our knowledge, only two extant programs offer both algorithmic and visualization tools for genotype analysis: haploview  <cit>  and hapscope  <cit> .
as described above, gevalt maintains the popular, user-friendly interface of haploview, but replaces its standard em algorithm for phasing with the gerbil algorithm.
this allows a more accurate estimation of the phased haplotypes and a visualization of each individual's inferred haplotypes .
besides the tagger algorithm for tag snps selection implemented in haploview , gevalt also offers stampa, which is not only very efficient, but also allows the user to choose the amount of tag snps.
other advantages and improvements over haploview are listed above.
a current limitation of gerbil is allowing at most  <dig> markers.
we intend to remove this limitation in the future .
the hapscope software includes analysis programs and a visualization tool.
most of the analyses are done separately using the command line and the results are then loaded into the visualization tool.
in contrast, in gevalt all the analyses are done within the graphical user interface, which makes it more user friendly and easy to use.
hapscope uses phase  <cit>  or snphap  <cit>  as its phasing algorithm.
phase was shown to be slightly more accurate than gerbil but much slower  <cit> .
in contrast to hapscope, gevalt facilitates association tests and can handle family structures.
on the other hand, only hapscope includes modules for reference sequence annotation, snp mapping and snp classification.
we intend to continue the development of gevalt.
in particular, we shall extend gerbil to handle more snps, and improve stampa so that it incorporates into its solution predefined tag snps.
we also intend to incorporate a new algorithm for evaluating the significance of disease association, which is dramatically faster than the standard permutation test  <cit> .
CONCLUSIONS
gevalt is an integrated viewer that uses state of the art phasing and tag snp selection algorithms.
it streamlines the application of gerbil and stampa, which were available until now only as batch executables, and allows using them together with the strong visualizations of haploview for assessment of the results.
both running the algorithms and visualizing the results are done within the graphical user interface, unlike, e.g., the hapscope software  <cit> , which only enables the latter.
this makes the algorithms accessible to the broad community of researchers in genetics.

"BACKGROUND
a decade-long debate reasons to what extent darwinian selection or neutral processes are driving the molecular evolution of genes and thus the ecological divergence of species  <cit> – <cit> .
selectionists argue that a large fraction of those non-synonymous dna base substitutions in coding genes going to fixation should be driven by positive darwinian selection  <cit> .
under a strict neutralist’s view, most fixed amino acid substitutions have no effect on fitness  <cit> , because purifying selection constantly removes alleles with strongly deleterious effects on fitness while positive effects were thought to be extremely rare.
later, the nearly neutral theory acknowledged that also substitutions with slightly deleterious effects may drift to fixation under realistic demographic scenarios  <cit> .
while the neutral theory was the prevailing model for several decades, the comparison of whole genome sequences has recently produced evidence for an important role of natural selection  <cit> .
in particular, for drosophila species, natural selection has been shown to shape both the coding and non-coding parts of the genome  <cit> .
however, before being able to draw general conclusions on the importance and mode of selection in shaping ecological divergence, more studies of systematically diverse taxa with differing life histories, demographies and mating systems are clearly needed  <cit> .
the recent progress in sequencing technology  <cit>  and resultant ability to sequence whole transcriptomes or genomes even for non-model species now opens up this opportunity  <cit> .
moreover, such approaches allow at the same time pinpointing the genomic basis of ecologically relevant traits and their evolutionary history  <cit> – <cit> .
this may be accomplished in two different ways: based on known ecological differences of the taxa under scrutiny it is possible to assess the processes driving the evolution of genes likely associated with the relevant traits.
this is an extension of the classical candidate gene or top down approach.
in addition, scanning coding genes for positive selection allows for a bottom up approach, which li et al.
<cit>  called “reverse ecology”.
the principle of the latter is to identify loci whose divergence was driven by positive selection and to infer hypotheses about ecological differences from their biological function.
in both cases, however, it remains challenging to functionally link the identified patterns with observed phenotypic differences.
to contribute to this scientific debate, we have conducted a comparative analysis of larval transcriptomes among the dipteran midge sister species pair chironomus riparius meigen  <dig>  and chironomus piger strenzke  <dig>   <cit> .
as co-occurring, morphologically cryptic sister species, they are particularly interesting to perform comparative genomic analyses of ecological niche differences for several reasons.
first, due to the shared evolutionary history, their general ecological niche is usually similar, which makes them prime candidates for interspecific competition and, to allow coexistence in sympatry, niche segregation  <cit> .
second, fixed genetic differences among them must have evolved during or after divergence, thereby also reflecting the selective forces leading to the observed ecological differences and/or reproductive isolation.
third, their coding gene sequences will almost certainly be sufficiently similar to distinguish orthologous from paralogous loci  <cit> .
fourth, the short evolutionary distance assures that the incidence of multiple mutational hits at individual sites is negligible, making it possible to infer which mutational changes have occurred since speciation  <cit> .
fifth, as morphologically cryptic species, identified differences likely not involve anatomic differences, thereby reducing the complexity of associating gene evolution with phenotypic differences.
the two chironomus species show differential swarming behaviour in the field, acting as a prezygotic isolation mechanism  <cit> .
while some studies indicate that c. riparius and c. piger readily form viable and fully fertile interspecific hybrids in the laboratory  <cit> , others estimate fertile hybrids in the wild to be effectively absent, due to fertility reductions caused by hybrid dysgenesis syndromes  <cit> .
indeed, no ongoing hybridisation in the field could be found in an early chromosomal study  <cit> , which was corroborated by a field survey applying microsatellites and mitochondrial markers  <cit> .
larvae of both species are widely distributed in small streams, ditches, ponds and puddles throughout the holarctic  <cit> .
the species are often dominating the local chironomus larval community  <cit> .
they frequently occur together at the same sites, however, usually one species prevails at a particular site  <cit> .
as chironomids spend most of their lifetime as larvae and usually even do not feed as imagines during their few days in this stage  <cit> , the larval stage is in general regarded as the relevant life cycle stage for ecological studies  <cit> .
this is especially true for the two species under scrutiny, c. piger and c. riparius, as they show clear ecological differentiation as larvae  <cit>  but nearly none as imagines  <cit> .
field data indicate that c. piger larvae are found preferentially in puddles and shallow ditches with higher maximum water temperatures, higher salinity, in particular higher nitrite and calcium concentrations as compared to sites inhabited by c. riparius <cit> .
the latter species often inhabits sediments with high organic content, indicating higher tolerance to anaerobic conditions  <cit> , which was confirmed in different experimental studies  <cit> .
in a recent experimental study c. piger coped better with higher nitrite concentrations  <cit> .
contrary to expectations from field studies, c. riparius’ fitness tended to be higher at both higher constant temperatures and larger daily temperature ranges.
however, the interaction of both stressors favoured c. piger in warm, high nitrite habitats, thus concurring to the field observations  <cit> .
based on this previous knowledge on ecological niche differences, proteins with functions in cell respiration as well as those concerning response to temperature and solved ions, especially nitrite detoxification, are promising candidates for interspecific differences driven by positive selection.
in this study, the following three questions were thus addressed: i) is positive darwinian selection a major evolutionary driving force for the divergence of the sister species?
ii) can genes with signs of positive selection be conclusively linked to known ecological differences between the two sister species?
iii) can we derive hypotheses on yet unrecognised ecological differences between the sister species from the observed pattern of divergence?
RESULTS
sequencing, assembly and annotation
sequencing the larval transcriptomes of the two midge species with the roche  <dig> technique resulted in  <dig> , <dig> quality filtered reads in total .
assembly using the clc genomics workbench yielded  <dig>  contigs for c. piger and  <dig>  for c. riparius, respectively .
mean contig length was  <dig> bp for c. piger and  <dig> bp for c. riparius.
n <dig> length was  <dig> bp for c. piger and  <dig> bp for c. riparius.
ninety-three percent  and 94%  of all reads could be mapped against the obtained contigs.
using the blastx algorithm,  <dig>  contigs of c. piger and  <dig>  contigs of c. riparius matched entries in the swiss-prot database with e-values below the threshold of 1e- <dig>  merging hits with identical descriptions irrespective of the hits’ taxon assignment resulted in  <dig>  unigenes in c. piger and  <dig>  unigenes in c. riparius with an overlap of  <dig>  genes.
of all contigs with blastx hits below 1e- <dig> a total of  <dig>  could be annotated with go terms .
alignment quality and sequence divergence
the programme orfpredictor assigned open reading frames , matching the set requirements, for  <dig>  contigs in c. piger  and for  <dig>  contigs in c. riparius , respectively.
orthomcl built  <dig>  groups of putative orthologues from translated sequences of the two sets of orfs from c. piger and c. riparius.
as  <dig>  groups only contained sequences from one or the other species, a total of  <dig>  groups were kept.
for each group the best-fitting sequences of the two species were then aligned and re-translated.
trimming of those alignments ended in  <dig>  final alignments with an average length of  <dig> bp.
of those,  <dig>  alignments  had no differences on the nucleotide level.
besides that, there was an apparent peak around 1% sequence divergence between the species .
the mean sequence divergence was  <dig> % on the nucleotide level and  <dig> % on the amino acid level, equalling  <dig>  amino acid substitutions in total.
detection of intraspecific genetic variation
single nucleotide polymorphism  identification in the species-specific mappings considered sequencing quality scores of the used and surrounding nucleotides, mapping depth and quantity of the rarer allele for quality control.
snp detection across the  <dig>  contigs in c. piger identified  <dig>  high quality diallelic snp positions.
after discarding all snps outside the defined high quality orfs,  <dig>  snp sites remained.
of those,  <dig>   were non-silent, and  <dig>   were silent.
the  <dig>  contigs in c. riparius yielded  <dig>  snp positions in total,  <dig>  of which were within a high quality orf.
at  <dig>  snp positions  the two alleles coded for different amino acids, while  <dig>  snp sites  were silent.
classification of snps according to the frequency of their rarer allele showed the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous snps to decrease at higher allele frequency .
snps were classified by the frequency of their rarer allele as follows: low frequency < 5%, moderate frequency 5-15%, and common 15-50%.
pn = non-synonymous snps, ps = synonymous snps, pn*/ps* = ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous snps per non-synonymous and synonymous sites, respectively.
measure of sequence evolution for the whole transcriptome
the estimated average proportion of amino acid substitutions fixed by positive selection, α, amounted to  <dig>  for the  <dig>  alignments included.
this estimate is significantly greater than zero with regard to the calculated confidence interval .
the analysis was repeated under exclusion of  low-frequency and  low+moderate-frequency snps to correct for slightly deleterious mutations.
this procedure slightly elevated α to   <dig>   and   <dig>  , respectively.
mcdonald-kreitman tests
the mcdonald-kreitman test , a robust test for positive selection using substitution and polymorphism data, could be applied to  <dig> alignments showing non-zero values in all four categories of nucleotide changes.
of those alignments,  <dig>  had a ratio of non-synonymous substitutions  to synonymous substitutions  significantly greater than the ratio of non-synonymous polymorphisms  to synonymous polymorphisms  with a fdr-corrected p-value ≤  <dig> , hence bore signs of positive selection between c. piger and c. riparius.
due to lacking blastx annotations in three of them, eight alignments with reliable signs of positive selection and available annotations remained .
shown are values for all alignments with a significant mkt value  and a significant blastx hit  against the swissprot database.
ω >  <dig>  indicating positive selection, printed in bold.
x = incalculable due to missing data for the four-species alignments, # = infinite value.
/ >  <dig> is an indicator of positive selection.
interspecific ω values are calculated with kaks_calculator using the same alignments as mkt; species-specific ω values are calculated with codeml using four-species alignments.
branch-specific ω
orthomcl built  <dig>  groups of putative orthologous sequences by means of the four sets of protein sequences from c. piger, c. riparius and the two mosquitoes a. aegypti and c. quinquefasciatus.
as only groups with at least one sequence per species were analysed further, a total of  <dig>  groups were kept.
trimming of the re-translated alignments of the best-fitting sequences per species resulted in  <dig>  final alignments with an average length of  <dig> bp.
using the programme paml, signs of positive selection were found in  <dig> alignments  in c. piger and  <dig> alignments  in c. riparius.
among the eight annotated genes with signs of positive selection in the mkt, two had branch-specific ω >  <dig> in one species and ω <  <dig> in the other, indicating directional selection.
here, plasma membrane calcium-transporting atpase  <dig> showed signs of positive selection only in c. piger and mitochondrial sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase only in c. riparius.
one protein  showed ω larger than one in both species, indicating disruptive selection between the species.
the rest were either incalculable in one or both species due to missing sequence data in the four-species alignments  or had branch-specific ω smaller than one .
discussion
comparative sequence-based studies are highly dependent on data quality.
the stringent approach taken here with orthology assignment of high quality contigs and rigorous trimming of the resultant alignments is therefore rather conservative, despite a considerable loss of data.
one source of errors that necessitated substantial trimming of the data was homopolymer stretches that pose well-known problems when sequencing with the  <dig> roche technology  <cit> .
by only using snps with the rarer allele observed at least twice, a misidentification of snps due to sequencing errors should not have posed considerable problems as the overall sequencing error rate  is only  <dig> % for  <dig> gs flx  <cit> .
with a mean coverage of  <dig> observed at the snp positions used, this equals p =  <dig> .
considering that only a small portion of those  <dig> sequencing mistakes are base replacement errors  <cit> , the effective error rate is even lower.
furthermore, included errors will most certainly contribute proportionally more to non-synonymous than to synonymous snps due to the high ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous positions.
the resulting overestimation of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous snps would therefore rather lead to a lowered, conservative signal of the impact of adaptive evolution in the mkt and the calculation of α.
it is, however, important to be aware of other immanent limitations of next-generation-sequencing-generated transcriptomic data for population genetic analyses.
transcriptomic sequences might miss alleles due to allele specific gene expression  <cit> .
this phenomenon is wide-spread  <cit>  and may result in an underestimation of intraspecific variation.
however, as allele specific gene expression is due to differential dna methylation, this may not present a substantial problem here, as dipterans have lost the main methylation enzymes in their evolutionary history  <cit> .
other limitations for the use of our data are due to the experimental design.
the pooling of individuals, although a common and recommended strategy for non-model organism studies aiming to identify as many alleles as possible  <cit> , did not allow scoring individual genotypes, which in turn precluded calculations of allele frequencies.
for this study,  <dig> individuals per species were sequenced at a mean mapping depth of  <dig>  nucleotides per position for c. piger and  <dig>  for c. riparius across all loci.
as we have used a minimum coverage of  <dig> reads per position in each species for snp detection, we have discovered only segregating alleles with a frequency over  <dig>  with a probability of > 90%.
interspecific patterns for the whole transcriptome
the mean interspecific nucleotide sequence divergence of  <dig> % on the cdna level, the mean silent site rate in coding regions  of  <dig>  and the fact that  <dig>  alignments  showed no differences at all, together illustrate the relatively close phylogenetic relationship between the sister species c. piger and c. riparius.
accordant calculations between two reproductively isolated ‘biotypes’ of the cryptic whitefly species bemisia tabaci revealed a mean divergence of  <dig> %  <cit> , while  <dig> % divergence were found between the two closely related drosophila species d. simulans and d. sechellia <cit>  and  <dig> % divergence between two very young sympatric crater lake cichlid fishes  <cit> .
a recent study across transcriptomes of the copepod tigriopus californicus even revealed higher median divergence on the interpopulation level .
on the other hand, the conservative alignment strategy taken here, with exclusion of seemingly too heterogeneous parts, may have led to a slight underestimation of the overall sequence divergence, as suggested by the  <dig> % of coding sequence divergence in the vwvz/7b globin gene cluster of c. piger and c. riparius <cit> .
since estimations of the species divergence time of c. piger and c. riparius based on large amounts of sequence data are lacking to date, the overall synonymous substitution rate of the orfs was used for a rough molecular clock calculation.
drosophilids are the best-analysed dipteran system concerning molecular clock analyses with rates of synonymous substitution per synonymous site per million years of  <dig>   <cit> ,  <dig>   <cit> , and  <dig>   <cit> .
transferring these brachyceran rates to the nematocerans c. piger and c. riparius resulted in an estimation of the species splitting event about  <dig>  to  <dig>  million years ago, which translates to a multiple number of generations since divergence in this multivoltine species.
this time frame clearly illustrates the existing potential for evolutionary processes to shape the species’ genomes.
number of genes identified
the number of genes found in the larval transcriptomes of c. piger  and c. riparius  is roughly a third to half the number of genes found in the genomes of the nematocerans anopheles gambiae [n =  <dig> ,  <cit> , aedes aegypti [n =  <dig> ,  <cit> , culex quinquefasciatus [n =  <dig> ,  <cit>  and the dipteran drosophila melanogaster [n =  <dig> ,  <cit> .
the discrepancy is explained by the fact that certainly not all genes are expressed in the l <dig> stage of the midges and only a single stressor  was applied.
for example, drosophila larval stages were shown to express only  <dig>  to  <dig>  different mrnas at once  <cit> .
moreover, using non-normalised cdna libraries likely resulted in missing genes with low expression levels.
global patterns of gene evolution
the α statistics showed approximately a quarter  of the  <dig>  amino acid substitutions to be driven by positive selection.
this finding is close to the average of  <dig> % found by eyre-walker in a meta-study of  <dig> interspecies comparisons  <cit> .
in another meta-study fay reported that 47% of  <dig> analysed species showed signs of positive selection, often affecting ca.
40% of all non-synonymous substitutions  <cit> .
among other factors, the level of adaptive evolution was shown in the former study to positively correlate with effective population size  <cit> .
bayesian coalescence analysis of published mitochondrial coi sequences estimated the effective mitochondrial population size to be quite high with  <dig>  ×  <dig>  for c. piger and  <dig>  x  <dig>  for c. riparius, respectively  <cit> .
an average fst of  <dig>  for c. piger and  <dig>  for c. riparius indicates little among population differentiation in both species  <cit> .
drift within both species thus seems to be a minor driving force here, a circumstance rendering natural selection particularly effective  <cit> .
inference of positive selection from polymorphism data
for the detection of positive selection on the level of individual genes, most reliable results can be gained from the mk test, which is more robust to demographic biases than, e.g.
the popular dn/ds method  <cit> .
however, the mk approach necessitated a more than 80% reduction of the data set, due to the high sequence similarity between the sister species.
of the remaining  <dig> genes used to calculate mk statistics,  <dig>  showed significant signs of positive selection.
this proportion of  <dig> % of positively selected candidate genes inferred with the mkt appears rather moderate.
this is especially so, since the genes expressed in the final larval stage of chironomids should be particularly prone to increased diversifying selection compared to the rest of the genome, because this is the phase in the life of the midges during which the competition  is potentially most severe among species  <cit> .
a recent genomic comparison of congeneric shallow and deep sea urchins indeed confirms that in particular genes expressed in the ecologically divergent life cycle stage show increased signatures of positive selection  <cit> .
the chironomid l <dig> transcriptomes may thus perhaps even overestimate the impact of adaptive evolution on the entire coding genome.
on the other hand, the mkt is rather conservative and positive selection having occurred early in divergence may have lost its signature  <cit> .
ecological implications of positively selected genes
although a sign of positive selection alone is only the first step in defining the genetic basis of ecological differentiation, such analyses are able to deliver promising potential candidate genes  <cit> .
among the eleven genes with significant signs of positive selection in the mkt, eight could be functionally annotated.
five of these genes suggest a correlation either to observed or so far unrecognised ecological differences between c. piger and c. riparius or to the evolution of reproductive isolation.
one of them, calreticulin, is a chaperone involved in protein folding and rejection of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> .
it might thus be linked to the different maximum temperatures in the respective habitats of c. riparius and c. piger <cit> , as increased temperature destabilises and degrades proteins  <cit> .
the nadh-cytochrome b <dig> reductase  <dig> is also known as methemoglobin reductase, which describes its main function, the reduction of methaemoglobin to haemoglobin  <cit> .
one of the main environmental agents causing the formation of detrimental methaemoglobin are nitrate/nitrite  <cit> , thus matching the observed and experimentally confirmed differential adaptation of the chironomid sister species to environmental nitrite concentrations  <cit> .
an increased efficiency due to positive selection in converting methaemoglobine would certainly explain the higher nitrite tolerance of c. piger and thus identify a genomic basis for the observed niche difference.
because chironomids possess more than  <dig> different globins  <cit>  which can make up as much as 90% of the last instar’s total hemolymph protein  <cit> , this might be of particular importance.
unfortunately, the methemoglobin reductase was not found in the dataset of all four taxa used in the branch-specific test, which precludes the inference of the direction of selection.
the branch-specific ω for plasma membrane calcium-transporting atpase  <dig>  revealed positive selection on the c. piger branch , as opposed to a neutral evolution of this gene in c. riparius .
pmca <dig> is responsible for the removal of calcium out of the cell  <cit> .
interestingly, pfenninger and nowak  <cit>  demonstrated conductivity in general and caco <dig> concentrations in particular to be significantly correlated to the relative abundance of c. piger and c. riparius, with the latter preferring lower concentrations, thus lending ecological plausibility to pmca <dig> as a candidate gene for positive selection.
besides proposing candidate genes for the known ecological differences between c. riparius and c. piger, the reverse ecology approach of studying whole transcriptomes also yields novel gene candidates with plausible relevance to the ecology and evolution of the sister taxa:
sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase is involved in hydrogen sulfide detoxification  <cit> .
hydrogen sulfide is produced by microorganisms under anaerobic conditions, being highly toxic to most metazoans.
the prevalence of c. riparius in anaerobic habitats like sewage sludge  <cit>  might therefore at least partly be based on higher hydrogen sulfide tolerance.
in accordance with this hypothesis is the high ω detected on the c. riparius branch  for sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase in contrast to the c. piger branch , suggesting adaptation to increased h2s levels in sediments of eutrophic water.
the nuclear encoded 39s ribosomal protein l <dig> interacts closely with mitochondrially encoded rrna molecules  <cit> , thus providing the basis for cytonuclear coevolution, in which structural changes in one partner  provide the stage for selection-driven compensatory changes in the interaction partner  <cit> .
intriguingly, the branch specific analysis shows positive selection along the branches of both species.
if the resulting changes in protein structure led to incompatibilities with the mitochondrial rrna of the respective other species in the formation of mitochondrial ribosomes, they may at least partially explain the observed reproductive isolation in the wild  <cit> .
cytonuclear incompatibilities indeed have been shown to confer reproductive isolation among other insects species  <cit> .
CONCLUSIONS
in accordance with recent meta-studies  <cit>  on the genome-wide prevalence of positive selection in insects, the data presented here argue that such darwinian processes are likely to have played an important role in the divergence of chironomus piger and c. riparius.
several gene loci showing signatures of directional or disruptive positive selection can explain observed ecological characteristics of niche divergence.
in addition, the reverse ecology approach pointed towards a new hypothesis with respect to the higher anaerobic tolerance of c. riparius.
the signs of positive selection on a sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase gene in this species suggest the possibility that this adaptation depends at least partly on a higher h2s-tolerance.
obviously, the above hypotheses, based solely on bioinformatic analysis of transcriptome sequences, need further investigations, in particular ecological experiments and functional protein assays, to functionally link the proposed candidate genes to the observed traits.
in addition, there are likely several, if not many other fixed functional differences among the sister species, which affect protein structure and gene expression and thereby determine their respective niches.
the presented study is therefore but a first step to fully understand the genomic basis of the ecological differences between c. piger and c. riparius.
however, since many of the known ecological differences are plausibly mirrored by patterns of sequence evolution, the taken approach appears to be a valuable starting point to dig deeper into the genomic details of niche segregation.
",926,"BACKGROUND
a decade-long debate reasons to what extent darwinian selection or neutral processes are driving the molecular evolution of genes and thus the ecological divergence of species  <cit> – <cit> . selectionists argue that a large fraction of those non-synonymous dna base substitutions in coding genes going to fixation should be driven by positive darwinian selection  <cit> . under a strict neutralist’s view, most fixed amino acid substitutions have no effect on fitness  <cit> , because purifying selection constantly removes alleles with strongly deleterious effects on fitness while positive effects were thought to be extremely rare. later, the nearly neutral theory acknowledged that also substitutions with slightly deleterious effects may drift to fixation under realistic demographic scenarios  <cit> . while the neutral theory was the prevailing model for several decades, the comparison of whole genome sequences has recently produced evidence for an important role of natural selection  <cit> . in particular, for drosophila species, natural selection has been shown to shape both the coding and non-coding parts of the genome  <cit> . however, before being able to draw general conclusions on the importance and mode of selection in shaping ecological divergence, more studies of systematically diverse taxa with differing life histories, demographies and mating systems are clearly needed  <cit> . the recent progress in sequencing technology  <cit>  and resultant ability to sequence whole transcriptomes or genomes even for non-model species now opens up this opportunity  <cit> . moreover, such approaches allow at the same time pinpointing the genomic basis of ecologically relevant traits and their evolutionary history  <cit> – <cit> . this may be accomplished in two different ways: based on known ecological differences of the taxa under scrutiny it is possible to assess the processes driving the evolution of genes likely associated with the relevant traits. this is an extension of the classical candidate gene or top down approach. in addition, scanning coding genes for positive selection allows for a bottom up approach, which li et al. <cit>  called “reverse ecology”. the principle of the latter is to identify loci whose divergence was driven by positive selection and to infer hypotheses about ecological differences from their biological function. in both cases, however, it remains challenging to functionally link the identified patterns with observed phenotypic differences.

to contribute to this scientific debate, we have conducted a comparative analysis of larval transcriptomes among the dipteran midge sister species pair chironomus riparius meigen  <dig>  and chironomus piger strenzke  <dig>   <cit> . as co-occurring, morphologically cryptic sister species, they are particularly interesting to perform comparative genomic analyses of ecological niche differences for several reasons. first, due to the shared evolutionary history, their general ecological niche is usually similar, which makes them prime candidates for interspecific competition and, to allow coexistence in sympatry, niche segregation  <cit> . second, fixed genetic differences among them must have evolved during or after divergence, thereby also reflecting the selective forces leading to the observed ecological differences and/or reproductive isolation. third, their coding gene sequences will almost certainly be sufficiently similar to distinguish orthologous from paralogous loci  <cit> . fourth, the short evolutionary distance assures that the incidence of multiple mutational hits at individual sites is negligible, making it possible to infer which mutational changes have occurred since speciation  <cit> . fifth, as morphologically cryptic species, identified differences likely not involve anatomic differences, thereby reducing the complexity of associating gene evolution with phenotypic differences.

the two chironomus species show differential swarming behaviour in the field, acting as a prezygotic isolation mechanism  <cit> . while some studies indicate that c. riparius and c. piger readily form viable and fully fertile interspecific hybrids in the laboratory  <cit> , others estimate fertile hybrids in the wild to be effectively absent, due to fertility reductions caused by hybrid dysgenesis syndromes  <cit> . indeed, no ongoing hybridisation in the field could be found in an early chromosomal study  <cit> , which was corroborated by a field survey applying microsatellites and mitochondrial markers  <cit> . larvae of both species are widely distributed in small streams, ditches, ponds and puddles throughout the holarctic  <cit> . the species are often dominating the local chironomus larval community  <cit> . they frequently occur together at the same sites, however, usually one species prevails at a particular site  <cit> . as chironomids spend most of their lifetime as larvae and usually even do not feed as imagines during their few days in this stage  <cit> , the larval stage is in general regarded as the relevant life cycle stage for ecological studies  <cit> . this is especially true for the two species under scrutiny, c. piger and c. riparius, as they show clear ecological differentiation as larvae  <cit>  but nearly none as imagines  <cit> . field data indicate that c. piger larvae are found preferentially in puddles and shallow ditches with higher maximum water temperatures, higher salinity, in particular higher nitrite and calcium concentrations as compared to sites inhabited by c. riparius <cit> . the latter species often inhabits sediments with high organic content, indicating higher tolerance to anaerobic conditions  <cit> , which was confirmed in different experimental studies  <cit> . in a recent experimental study c. piger coped better with higher nitrite concentrations  <cit> . contrary to expectations from field studies, c. riparius’ fitness tended to be higher at both higher constant temperatures and larger daily temperature ranges. however, the interaction of both stressors favoured c. piger in warm, high nitrite habitats, thus concurring to the field observations  <cit> . based on this previous knowledge on ecological niche differences, proteins with functions in cell respiration as well as those concerning response to temperature and solved ions, especially nitrite detoxification, are promising candidates for interspecific differences driven by positive selection.

in this study, the following three questions were thus addressed: i) is positive darwinian selection a major evolutionary driving force for the divergence of the sister species? ii) can genes with signs of positive selection be conclusively linked to known ecological differences between the two sister species? iii) can we derive hypotheses on yet unrecognised ecological differences between the sister species from the observed pattern of divergence?

RESULTS
sequencing, assembly and annotation
sequencing the larval transcriptomes of the two midge species with the roche  <dig> technique resulted in  <dig> , <dig> quality filtered reads in total . assembly using the clc genomics workbench yielded  <dig>  contigs for c. piger and  <dig>  for c. riparius, respectively . mean contig length was  <dig> bp for c. piger and  <dig> bp for c. riparius. n <dig> length was  <dig> bp for c. piger and  <dig> bp for c. riparius. ninety-three percent  and 94%  of all reads could be mapped against the obtained contigs.

using the blastx algorithm,  <dig>  contigs of c. piger and  <dig>  contigs of c. riparius matched entries in the swiss-prot database with e-values below the threshold of 1e- <dig>  merging hits with identical descriptions irrespective of the hits’ taxon assignment resulted in  <dig>  unigenes in c. piger and  <dig>  unigenes in c. riparius with an overlap of  <dig>  genes. of all contigs with blastx hits below 1e- <dig> a total of  <dig>  could be annotated with go terms .

alignment quality and sequence divergence
the programme orfpredictor assigned open reading frames , matching the set requirements, for  <dig>  contigs in c. piger  and for  <dig>  contigs in c. riparius , respectively. orthomcl built  <dig>  groups of putative orthologues from translated sequences of the two sets of orfs from c. piger and c. riparius. as  <dig>  groups only contained sequences from one or the other species, a total of  <dig>  groups were kept. for each group the best-fitting sequences of the two species were then aligned and re-translated. trimming of those alignments ended in  <dig>  final alignments with an average length of  <dig> bp. of those,  <dig>  alignments  had no differences on the nucleotide level. besides that, there was an apparent peak around 1% sequence divergence between the species . the mean sequence divergence was  <dig> % on the nucleotide level and  <dig> % on the amino acid level, equalling  <dig>  amino acid substitutions in total.

detection of intraspecific genetic variation
single nucleotide polymorphism  identification in the species-specific mappings considered sequencing quality scores of the used and surrounding nucleotides, mapping depth and quantity of the rarer allele for quality control. snp detection across the  <dig>  contigs in c. piger identified  <dig>  high quality diallelic snp positions. after discarding all snps outside the defined high quality orfs,  <dig>  snp sites remained. of those,  <dig>   were non-silent, and  <dig>   were silent. the  <dig>  contigs in c. riparius yielded  <dig>  snp positions in total,  <dig>  of which were within a high quality orf. at  <dig>  snp positions  the two alleles coded for different amino acids, while  <dig>  snp sites  were silent. classification of snps according to the frequency of their rarer allele showed the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous snps to decrease at higher allele frequency .

snps were classified by the frequency of their rarer allele as follows: low frequency < 5%, moderate frequency 5-15%, and common 15-50%. pn = non-synonymous snps, ps = synonymous snps, pn*/ps* = ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous snps per non-synonymous and synonymous sites, respectively.

measure of sequence evolution for the whole transcriptome
the estimated average proportion of amino acid substitutions fixed by positive selection, α, amounted to  <dig>  for the  <dig>  alignments included. this estimate is significantly greater than zero with regard to the calculated confidence interval . the analysis was repeated under exclusion of  low-frequency and  low+moderate-frequency snps to correct for slightly deleterious mutations. this procedure slightly elevated α to   <dig>   and   <dig>  , respectively.

mcdonald-kreitman tests
the mcdonald-kreitman test , a robust test for positive selection using substitution and polymorphism data, could be applied to  <dig> alignments showing non-zero values in all four categories of nucleotide changes. of those alignments,  <dig>  had a ratio of non-synonymous substitutions  to synonymous substitutions  significantly greater than the ratio of non-synonymous polymorphisms  to synonymous polymorphisms  with a fdr-corrected p-value ≤  <dig> , hence bore signs of positive selection between c. piger and c. riparius. due to lacking blastx annotations in three of them, eight alignments with reliable signs of positive selection and available annotations remained .

shown are values for all alignments with a significant mkt value  and a significant blastx hit  against the swissprot database. ω >  <dig>  indicating positive selection, printed in bold. x = incalculable due to missing data for the four-species alignments, # = infinite value.

/ >  <dig> is an indicator of positive selection. interspecific ω values are calculated with kaks_calculator using the same alignments as mkt; species-specific ω values are calculated with codeml using four-species alignments.

branch-specific ω
orthomcl built  <dig>  groups of putative orthologous sequences by means of the four sets of protein sequences from c. piger, c. riparius and the two mosquitoes a. aegypti and c. quinquefasciatus. as only groups with at least one sequence per species were analysed further, a total of  <dig>  groups were kept. trimming of the re-translated alignments of the best-fitting sequences per species resulted in  <dig>  final alignments with an average length of  <dig> bp. using the programme paml, signs of positive selection were found in  <dig> alignments  in c. piger and  <dig> alignments  in c. riparius.

among the eight annotated genes with signs of positive selection in the mkt, two had branch-specific ω >  <dig> in one species and ω <  <dig> in the other, indicating directional selection. here, plasma membrane calcium-transporting atpase  <dig> showed signs of positive selection only in c. piger and mitochondrial sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase only in c. riparius. one protein  showed ω larger than one in both species, indicating disruptive selection between the species. the rest were either incalculable in one or both species due to missing sequence data in the four-species alignments  or had branch-specific ω smaller than one .

discussion
comparative sequence-based studies are highly dependent on data quality. the stringent approach taken here with orthology assignment of high quality contigs and rigorous trimming of the resultant alignments is therefore rather conservative, despite a considerable loss of data. one source of errors that necessitated substantial trimming of the data was homopolymer stretches that pose well-known problems when sequencing with the  <dig> roche technology  <cit> . by only using snps with the rarer allele observed at least twice, a misidentification of snps due to sequencing errors should not have posed considerable problems as the overall sequencing error rate  is only  <dig> % for  <dig> gs flx  <cit> . with a mean coverage of  <dig> observed at the snp positions used, this equals p =  <dig> . considering that only a small portion of those  <dig> sequencing mistakes are base replacement errors  <cit> , the effective error rate is even lower. furthermore, included errors will most certainly contribute proportionally more to non-synonymous than to synonymous snps due to the high ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous positions. the resulting overestimation of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous snps would therefore rather lead to a lowered, conservative signal of the impact of adaptive evolution in the mkt and the calculation of α.

it is, however, important to be aware of other immanent limitations of next-generation-sequencing-generated transcriptomic data for population genetic analyses. transcriptomic sequences might miss alleles due to allele specific gene expression  <cit> . this phenomenon is wide-spread  <cit>  and may result in an underestimation of intraspecific variation. however, as allele specific gene expression is due to differential dna methylation, this may not present a substantial problem here, as dipterans have lost the main methylation enzymes in their evolutionary history  <cit> . other limitations for the use of our data are due to the experimental design. the pooling of individuals, although a common and recommended strategy for non-model organism studies aiming to identify as many alleles as possible  <cit> , did not allow scoring individual genotypes, which in turn precluded calculations of allele frequencies. for this study,  <dig> individuals per species were sequenced at a mean mapping depth of  <dig>  nucleotides per position for c. piger and  <dig>  for c. riparius across all loci. as we have used a minimum coverage of  <dig> reads per position in each species for snp detection, we have discovered only segregating alleles with a frequency over  <dig>  with a probability of > 90%.

interspecific patterns for the whole transcriptome
the mean interspecific nucleotide sequence divergence of  <dig> % on the cdna level, the mean silent site rate in coding regions  of  <dig>  and the fact that  <dig>  alignments  showed no differences at all, together illustrate the relatively close phylogenetic relationship between the sister species c. piger and c. riparius. accordant calculations between two reproductively isolated ‘biotypes’ of the cryptic whitefly species bemisia tabaci revealed a mean divergence of  <dig> %  <cit> , while  <dig> % divergence were found between the two closely related drosophila species d. simulans and d. sechellia <cit>  and  <dig> % divergence between two very young sympatric crater lake cichlid fishes  <cit> . a recent study across transcriptomes of the copepod tigriopus californicus even revealed higher median divergence on the interpopulation level . on the other hand, the conservative alignment strategy taken here, with exclusion of seemingly too heterogeneous parts, may have led to a slight underestimation of the overall sequence divergence, as suggested by the  <dig> % of coding sequence divergence in the vwvz/7b globin gene cluster of c. piger and c. riparius <cit> .

since estimations of the species divergence time of c. piger and c. riparius based on large amounts of sequence data are lacking to date, the overall synonymous substitution rate of the orfs was used for a rough molecular clock calculation. drosophilids are the best-analysed dipteran system concerning molecular clock analyses with rates of synonymous substitution per synonymous site per million years of  <dig>   <cit> ,  <dig>   <cit> , and  <dig>   <cit> . transferring these brachyceran rates to the nematocerans c. piger and c. riparius resulted in an estimation of the species splitting event about  <dig>  to  <dig>  million years ago, which translates to a multiple number of generations since divergence in this multivoltine species. this time frame clearly illustrates the existing potential for evolutionary processes to shape the species’ genomes.

the α statistics showed approximately a quarter  of the  <dig>  amino acid substitutions to be driven by positive selection. this finding is close to the average of  <dig> % found by eyre-walker in a meta-study of  <dig> interspecies comparisons  <cit> . in another meta-study fay reported that 47% of  <dig> analysed species showed signs of positive selection, often affecting ca. 40% of all non-synonymous substitutions  <cit> . among other factors, the level of adaptive evolution was shown in the former study to positively correlate with effective population size  <cit> . bayesian coalescence analysis of published mitochondrial coi sequences estimated the effective mitochondrial population size to be quite high with  <dig>  ×  <dig>  for c. piger and  <dig>  x  <dig>  for c. riparius, respectively  <cit> . an average fst of  <dig>  for c. piger and  <dig>  for c. riparius indicates little among population differentiation in both species  <cit> . drift within both species thus seems to be a minor driving force here, a circumstance rendering natural selection particularly effective  <cit> .

one of them, calreticulin, is a chaperone involved in protein folding and rejection of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . it might thus be linked to the different maximum temperatures in the respective habitats of c. riparius and c. piger <cit> , as increased temperature destabilises and degrades proteins  <cit> .

the nadh-cytochrome b <dig> reductase  <dig> is also known as methemoglobin reductase, which describes its main function, the reduction of methaemoglobin to haemoglobin  <cit> . one of the main environmental agents causing the formation of detrimental methaemoglobin are nitrate/nitrite  <cit> , thus matching the observed and experimentally confirmed differential adaptation of the chironomid sister species to environmental nitrite concentrations  <cit> . an increased efficiency due to positive selection in converting methaemoglobine would certainly explain the higher nitrite tolerance of c. piger and thus identify a genomic basis for the observed niche difference. because chironomids possess more than  <dig> different globins  <cit>  which can make up as much as 90% of the last instar’s total hemolymph protein  <cit> , this might be of particular importance. unfortunately, the methemoglobin reductase was not found in the dataset of all four taxa used in the branch-specific test, which precludes the inference of the direction of selection.

the branch-specific ω for plasma membrane calcium-transporting atpase  <dig>  revealed positive selection on the c. piger branch , as opposed to a neutral evolution of this gene in c. riparius . pmca <dig> is responsible for the removal of calcium out of the cell  <cit> . interestingly, pfenninger and nowak  <cit>  demonstrated conductivity in general and caco <dig> concentrations in particular to be significantly correlated to the relative abundance of c. piger and c. riparius, with the latter preferring lower concentrations, thus lending ecological plausibility to pmca <dig> as a candidate gene for positive selection.

besides proposing candidate genes for the known ecological differences between c. riparius and c. piger, the reverse ecology approach of studying whole transcriptomes also yields novel gene candidates with plausible relevance to the ecology and evolution of the sister taxa:

sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase is involved in hydrogen sulfide detoxification  <cit> . hydrogen sulfide is produced by microorganisms under anaerobic conditions, being highly toxic to most metazoans. the prevalence of c. riparius in anaerobic habitats like sewage sludge  <cit>  might therefore at least partly be based on higher hydrogen sulfide tolerance. in accordance with this hypothesis is the high ω detected on the c. riparius branch  for sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase in contrast to the c. piger branch , suggesting adaptation to increased h2s levels in sediments of eutrophic water.

the nuclear encoded 39s ribosomal protein l <dig> interacts closely with mitochondrially encoded rrna molecules  <cit> , thus providing the basis for cytonuclear coevolution, in which structural changes in one partner  provide the stage for selection-driven compensatory changes in the interaction partner  <cit> . intriguingly, the branch specific analysis shows positive selection along the branches of both species. if the resulting changes in protein structure led to incompatibilities with the mitochondrial rrna of the respective other species in the formation of mitochondrial ribosomes, they may at least partially explain the observed reproductive isolation in the wild  <cit> . cytonuclear incompatibilities indeed have been shown to confer reproductive isolation among other insects species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in accordance with recent meta-studies  <cit>  on the genome-wide prevalence of positive selection in insects, the data presented here argue that such darwinian processes are likely to have played an important role in the divergence of chironomus piger and c. riparius. several gene loci showing signatures of directional or disruptive positive selection can explain observed ecological characteristics of niche divergence. in addition, the reverse ecology approach pointed towards a new hypothesis with respect to the higher anaerobic tolerance of c. riparius. the signs of positive selection on a sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase gene in this species suggest the possibility that this adaptation depends at least partly on a higher h2s-tolerance.

obviously, the above hypotheses, based solely on bioinformatic analysis of transcriptome sequences, need further investigations, in particular ecological experiments and functional protein assays, to functionally link the proposed candidate genes to the observed traits. in addition, there are likely several, if not many other fixed functional differences among the sister species, which affect protein structure and gene expression and thereby determine their respective niches. the presented study is therefore but a first step to fully understand the genomic basis of the ecological differences between c. piger and c. riparius. however, since many of the known ecological differences are plausibly mirrored by patterns of sequence evolution, the taken approach appears to be a valuable starting point to dig deeper into the genomic details of niche segregation.

","finally, a divergently selected, nuclear encoded mitochondrial ribosomal protein may contribute to reproductive isolation due to cytonuclear coevolution.
despite a small mean sequence divergence of  <dig> % between the sister species,  <dig> % of  <dig>  observed amino acid substitutions were inferred by α statistics to be driven by positive selection.

"BACKGROUND
the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome that contains two superhelical turns of dna wrapped around an octamer of two copies each of the core histones h2a, h2b, h <dig> and h <dig>  <cit> .
resolution of the nucleosome structure revealed that the n-terminal histone tails protrude from the nucleosomal core in an unstructured manner  <cit>  and contain an ever-growing number of post-translational modifications such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and more recently, citrullination  <cit> .
importantly, these modifications, or “marks”, play critical roles in many cellular functions, including dna replication, condensation, and repair, as well as gene regulation  <cit> .
of these modifications, histone acetylation is perhaps most strongly associated with gene regulation.
increasing levels of histone acetylation are correlated with a transcriptionally permissive state whereas deacetylated histone are closely associated with transcriptional repression  <cit> .
histone acetylation is also implicated in the activation of embryonic gene expression in preimplantation embryos  <cit> .
for example, previous reports investigating late two-cell embryos have found that inducing histone hyperacetylation with hdac inhibitors stimulates global transcription  <cit>  and depletion of hdac <dig> by rnai results in elevated levels of specific gene targets  <cit> .
previous studies in somatic cells have demonstrated that specific histone modifications can directly affect the levels of other marks and this interplay leads to a complex mechanism of gene regulation, frequently referred to as the “histone code”  <cit> .
while fewer of these types of studies have been carried out in early embryos, several reports have found that cross-talk exist between histone acetylation and histone methylation in normal and cloned embryos  <cit> .
padi enzymes are increasingly being associated with the regulation of chromatin structure and gene activity via histone citrullination.
for example, we have found that padi4-mediated citrullination of histone h <dig> arginine  <dig> at the tff1promoter in mcf <dig> cells appears to regulate the expression of this canonical estrogen receptor target  <cit> .
others have shown that padi4-mediated histone citrullination plays a role in regulating other target genes such as trp <dig> and okl <dig> <cit> .
in addition to padi <dig>  we recently found that padi <dig> localizes to the nucleus of mammary epithelial cells and appears to target histone h <dig> for citrullination  <cit> , thus suggesting that multiple padis regulate chromatin-based activities.
we have previously documented that oocyte -and-embryo abundant padi <dig> is required for female fertility, with padi6-null embryos arresting at the two-cell stage of development  <cit> .
given the growing body of literature linking padi enzymes to histone citrullination and the abundance of padi <dig> in oocytes and early embryos, we first tested whether histones were citrullinated in oocytes and preimplantation embryos.
next, we treated embryos with the padi-specific inhibitor, cl-amidine, to confirm that the observed citrulline marks were generated by padi activity and also to test whether inhibition of padi activity may affect preimplantation development in vitro.
lastly, to gain insight into potential mechanisms by which histone citrullination may regulate gene activity, we tested whether inhibition of padi activity in early embryos affects histone acetylation and whether induction of histone hypoacetylation affected levels of histone citrullination.
findings from this study are discussed below.
RESULTS
citrullination of histone h <dig> and h <dig> tails in oocytes and in preimplantation embryos appears to be robust and dynamic
in the present study, the status of histone h <dig> and h <dig> citrullination during early development was investigated by staining fully grown mouse germinal vesicle  stage oocytes and preimplantation embryos with three site-specific citrullinated histone antibodies: anti-histone h <dig> citrulline  <dig> , anti-histone h <dig> citrulline  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and anti-histone h <dig> citrulline  <dig>   <cit> .
results from these confocal indirect immunofluorescence studies showed that h4cit <dig> staining was observed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of oocytes and early embryos at interphase.
interestingly, the strongest staining for this citrulline modification appears to occur on mitotic metaphase chromatin, suggesting that h4cit <dig> may play a role in chromatin condensation or decondensation at metaphase .
staining with the anti-h3cit2 + 8 +  <dig> antibody found that this modification also stained nuclei during interphase .
however, at metaphase, this antibody appeared to primarily stain the spindle apparatus  and a structure at opposed regions of two cell blastomeres that appears to be the microtubule-containing mid-body  <cit>  .
interestingly, in somatic cells, an anti-phospho-h <dig> serine  <dig> antibody detected histones with this modification at the anaphase spindle apparatus and at the mid-body during cytokinesis  <cit> .
these investigators speculated that this modification may mark histones for removal from the nucleosome or possibly that this modified histone may actually play a direct role in cytokinesis by functioning at the mid-body  <cit> .
it is currently not known whether citrullinated histones in the cytoplasm of oocytes and early embryos might have a similar function.
alternatively, however, it is also possible that the observed spindle and mid-body staining with the h3cit2 + 8 +  <dig> antibody is non-specific in nature.
the staining pattern observed with the anti-h3cit <dig> was perhaps the most interesting of all.
results found that both oocytes and early embryos showed a strong punctate cytoplasmic signal that appeared to coalesce into larger aggregates as the embryos developed  and these foci appeared by light microscopy to be lipid droplets.
to test this hypothesis we stained mutant mater gv oocytes  with nile red or with the h3cit <dig> antibody.
results show  that the h3cit26-containing cytoplasmic foci clearly appear to be lipid droplets.
interestingly, a recent study found that lipid droplets in drosophila embryos are maternally-derived and that these structures contain ~50% of all embryonic histones.
this finding suggests that the lipid droplets function to sequester maternal histones in the early embryo until they are needed for chromatin-based activities  <cit> .
an intriguing possibility is that the h3cit <dig> modification marks histones for lipid droplet storage and/or possibly shuttling histones between lipid droplets and the nucleus.
h3cit <dig> staining within the nucleus was also interesting; whereas little to no signal was seen in gv stage oocytes, strong staining was observed on the outer margins of both male and female pronuclei and around the nucleoli of two-cell embryos .
by the four-cell stage of development no nuclear staining was observed.
given that embryonic genome activation is known to initiate at the late pronuclear/early two-cell stage, this observation raises the possibility that this particular citrulline modification may play a role in activation of the embryonic genome.
taken together, our data raise the possibility that the different histone modification sites may play different roles in preimplantation development.
given that each of these anti-citrullinated histone antibodies showed both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization patterns, we next confirmed the specificity of our antibodies by testing whether pre-absorption of the antibodies with their cognate peptide affected indirect immunofluorescence signal intensity levels .
results showed that peptide preabsorption suppressed the fluorescence intensity for each of the three antibodies .
these results suggest that the localization patterns observed for the h4cit <dig>  h3cit2 + 8 +  <dig>  and h3cit <dig> are specific.
cl-amidine blocks mouse embryonic development beyond the two to four cell stage in vitro
the above observations suggested that padi-mediated histone citrullination may play an important, previously unknown, role in early development.
given that padi <dig> is essential for early cleavage divisions, we next tested whether levels of these modifications were reduced in padi6-null mouse oocytes/early embryos.
we found that loss of padi <dig> did not appear to affect histone citrullination levels .
given padi4’s previously documented roles in histone citrullination and gene regulation  <cit> , we then tested citrullinated histone levels in padi4-null oocytes.
again, we did not observe any appreciable loss in levels of citrullinated histone in this mutant line .
together, these observations suggest, neither padi <dig> nor padi <dig> catalyze these specific citrulline modifications on histones in oocytes or early embryos.
given these observations, and the lack of mutant padi <dig>  padi <dig>  and padi <dig> mouse lines, we next decided to test the effects of a newly developed padi inhibitor, cl-amidine, on histone citrullination and on early embryonic development.
cl-amidine has been shown to irreversibly block the activity of all padi enzymes in vitro and has also been shown in cell culture and mouse-based assays to functionally inhibit padi activity in vivo <cit> .
we first tested whether cl-amidine suppressed citrulline levels on histones in early embryos using the h4cit <dig>  h3cit2 + 8 +  <dig>  and h3cit <dig> antibodies.
pn zygotes were cultured in ksom media supplemented without or with  <dig> μm of cl-amidine.
embryos at the 4-cell stage from ksom and cl-amidine groups were fixed after being cultured for ~ <dig> hours and ~ <dig> hours, respectively, to ensure developmental arrest at cleavage stage.
next, the embryos were stained with the anti-citrullinated histone antibodies and then evaluated by laser scanning confocal microscopy.
results showed that staining levels for the h4cit <dig> and h3cit2 + 8 +  <dig> antibodies was reduced, compared with the ksom control group .
interestingly, however, cl-amidine treatment did not appear to affect levels of the h3cit <dig> modification, suggesting that histone citrullination at this site may have occurred in oocytes prior to drug treatment .
actin levels and localization did not appear to be affected by cl-amidine.
these results support the hypothesis that the histone citrullination in embryos is catalyzed by padi activity.
we next investigated the effects of cl-amidine on embryonic development in vitro.
as a control for these experiments, we also tested the effect of h-amidine on development.
this analog displays very weak padi inhibitory activity  <cit>  with, for example, the ic <dig> values of cl-amidine and h-amidine for pad <dig> inhibition in vitro being  <dig>  μm and > 1000μm, respectively  <cit> .
the structures of these two compounds are shown in figure 2d and 2e.
pn stage zygotes were cultured for ~ <dig> hours in ksom media supplemented with  <dig> μm of either cl-amidine or h-amidine.
the number and developmental stage of embryos was then evaluated using light microscopy.
results showed that embryos arrested either at the 2- <dig> cell stage  or at the 1-cell stage  in the cl-amidine group, while  <dig> % of embryos  in the h-amidine group and  <dig> % of embryos  in ksom medium alone developed to the morula stage .
we note here that  the concentration of cl-amidine used in our study is within the range of that used to functionally block padi activity in somatic cells  <cit>  and that  lower concentrations of cl-amidine did not affect embryonic development .
our finding that cl-amidine suppressed histone citrullination in cleavage-stage embryos suggested that the observed effects of cl-amidine on development were due to specific inhibition of padi activity.
however, it is also possible that the inhibitor blocked development because of non-specific toxic side-effects.
to address this possibility, we first examined embryo viability following cl-amidine and h-amidine treatment using the vital dye propidium iodide .
results showed that nuclei from both cl-amidine and h-amidine treated  embryos were not stained with pi  while nuclei from embryos that were treated with cl-amidine and extracted with  <dig> % triton were strongly stained with pi .
these results indicate that the plasma membrane of cl-amidine and h-amidine treated embryos appeared functional.
to further confirm embryo viability, we next evaluated the mitochondrial membrane potential of cl-amidine and h-amidine treated embryos using the jc- <dig> fluorescent dye, which accumulates in functional mitochondria as red-staining aggregates .
results showed that the mitochondrial membrane potential appeared to be similar between the cl-amidine and h-amidine treatment groups, suggesting the cl-amidine does not affect mitochondrial health.
together, these findings suggest that padi activity is required for progression of embryonic development beyond the two to four cell stage.
treatment of embryos with c-amidine suppresses histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation while having no apparent effect on the repressive h3k <dig> di-methyl modification
as noted, histone acetylation is well correlated with activation of gene expression in somatic cells and is also believed to play an important role in modulating gene expression in preimplantation embryos  <cit> .
in order to begin testing whether histone citrullination may play a role regulating gene activity in early embryos, we tested whether suppression of histone citrullination with cl-amidine affected levels of histone acetylation on h <dig> and h <dig> tails.
results showed that cl-amidine treatment significantly reduced levels of histone h <dig> acetylation .
the fluorescent intensities for hyper acetylated h <dig>  and h4k <dig> acetyl  in cl-amidine, tsa, and ksom groups were presented in figure 3b and 3f.
additionally, cl-amidine also dramatically reduced the level of acetylation on the h <dig> tail, namely h3k <dig> acetyl  and h3k <dig> acetyl  .
the fluorescent intensities for these modifications were showed in figure 3b and 3d.
to gain further insight into the mechanisms by which histone citrullination may regulate gene activity, we also tested whether cl-amidine affected levels of di-methylated histone h3k <dig>  a modification closely associated with transcriptional repression  <cit> .
we found that levels of this modification were not significantly affected by cl-amidine treatment .
to validate the specificity of the acetylated histone antibodies, the embryos were also treated with the hdac inhibitor trichostatin a , and as expected, staining for acetylated histones  was elevated following tsa treatment .
taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of padi-mediated histone citrullination suppresses histone acetylation.
histone hyperacetylation promotes histone citrullination in early embryos
to further explore the potential interplay between histone citrullination and acetylation, the colocalization of citrullination at h3r2 + 8 +  <dig> and acetylation at h3k <dig> was tested in 2-cell embryos.
results revealed that these two histone modifications localize, in part, to different regions of the nucleus, and they do appear to colocalize at specific foci in 2-cell embryos .
to further test whether there was a potential crosstalk between histone citrullination and acetylation, levels of h3r2 + 8 +  <dig> citrullination were examined in embryos treated with either tsa or cl-amidine.
to perform this experiment, pn zygotes were recovered from b6d2f1/j females and cultured in ksom medium supplemented with either  <dig> nm of tsa or  <dig> μm of cl-amidine, respectively, for ~ <dig> hours.
results showed that, as expected, levels of h3cit2 + 18 +  <dig> were significantly reduced following cl-amidine treatment .
interestingly, however, we found that induction of histone hyperactylation via tsa treatment also resulted in significantly increased levels of citrullination at h3r2 + 8 +  <dig> .
this observation further suggests that there is a reinforcing relationship between acetylation and citrullination and further highlights the potential interplay between these two modifications on chromatin in preimplantation mammalian embryos.
CONCLUSIONS
this report is the first to document the presence of citrullinated histones in mammalian oocytes and preimplantation embryos.
the use of three site-specific citrullinated histone antibodies found that histone citrullination is likely playing several unique, yet to be defined roles on chromatin templated events.
we found that the padi inhibitor, cl-amidine, potently blocks embryonic development beyond the 4-cell stage, thus further highlighting the important role of padis in early development.
this observation also raises the possibility that padi inhibitors could potentially be utilized as novel contraceptives.
our study also showed that cl-amidine specifically suppressed histone acetylation on the h <dig> and h <dig> tails while not affecting levels of the transcriptionally repressive histone h3k <dig> dimethyl modification.
further, we found that induction of histone hyperacetylation leads to enhanced histone citrullination.
mechanistically, as with numerous other histone modifications  <cit> , these observations raise the distinct possibility that the citrulline modification on histones may function as a “platform” for binding by histone acetyltransferases , thus facilitating transcriptional activation by enhancing levels of histone acetylation.
more detailed studies are now required to test this hypothesis.
we predict that outcomes from the current study will likely lead to new and important insight into epigenetic regulation of the oocyte to embryo transition.

cl-amidine blocks mouse embryonic development beyond the two to four cell stage in vitro
the above observations suggested that padi-mediated histone citrullination may play an important, previously unknown, role in early development. given that padi <dig> is essential for early cleavage divisions, we next tested whether levels of these modifications were reduced in padi6-null mouse oocytes/early embryos. we found that loss of padi <dig> did not appear to affect histone citrullination levels . given padi4’s previously documented roles in histone citrullination and gene regulation  <cit> , we then tested citrullinated histone levels in padi4-null oocytes. again, we did not observe any appreciable loss in levels of citrullinated histone in this mutant line . together, these observations suggest, neither padi <dig> nor padi <dig> catalyze these specific citrulline modifications on histones in oocytes or early embryos.

we next investigated the effects of cl-amidine on embryonic development in vitro. as a control for these experiments, we also tested the effect of h-amidine on development. this analog displays very weak padi inhibitory activity  <cit>  with, for example, the ic <dig> values of cl-amidine and h-amidine for pad <dig> inhibition in vitro being  <dig>  μm and > 1000μm, respectively  <cit> . the structures of these two compounds are shown in figure 2d and 2e. pn stage zygotes were cultured for ~ <dig> hours in ksom media supplemented with  <dig> μm of either cl-amidine or h-amidine. the number and developmental stage of embryos was then evaluated using light microscopy. results showed that embryos arrested either at the 2- <dig> cell stage  or at the 1-cell stage  in the cl-amidine group, while  <dig> % of embryos  in the h-amidine group and  <dig> % of embryos  in ksom medium alone developed to the morula stage . we note here that  the concentration of cl-amidine used in our study is within the range of that used to functionally block padi activity in somatic cells  <cit>  and that  lower concentrations of cl-amidine did not affect embryonic development . our finding that cl-amidine suppressed histone citrullination in cleavage-stage embryos suggested that the observed effects of cl-amidine on development were due to specific inhibition of padi activity. however, it is also possible that the inhibitor blocked development because of non-specific toxic side-effects. to address this possibility, we first examined embryo viability following cl-amidine and h-amidine treatment using the vital dye propidium iodide . results showed that nuclei from both cl-amidine and h-amidine treated  embryos were not stained with pi  while nuclei from embryos that were treated with cl-amidine and extracted with  <dig> % triton were strongly stained with pi . these results indicate that the plasma membrane of cl-amidine and h-amidine treated embryos appeared functional. to further confirm embryo viability, we next evaluated the mitochondrial membrane potential of cl-amidine and h-amidine treated embryos using the jc- <dig> fluorescent dye, which accumulates in functional mitochondria as red-staining aggregates . results showed that the mitochondrial membrane potential appeared to be similar between the cl-amidine and h-amidine treatment groups, suggesting the cl-amidine does not affect mitochondrial health. together, these findings suggest that padi activity is required for progression of embryonic development beyond the two to four cell stage.

treatment of embryos with c-amidine suppresses histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation while having no apparent effect on the repressive h3k <dig> di-methyl modification
as noted, histone acetylation is well correlated with activation of gene expression in somatic cells and is also believed to play an important role in modulating gene expression in preimplantation embryos  <cit> . in order to begin testing whether histone citrullination may play a role regulating gene activity in early embryos, we tested whether suppression of histone citrullination with cl-amidine affected levels of histone acetylation on h <dig> and h <dig> tails. results showed that cl-amidine treatment significantly reduced levels of histone h <dig> acetylation . the fluorescent intensities for hyper acetylated h <dig>  and h4k <dig> acetyl  in cl-amidine, tsa, and ksom groups were presented in figure 3b and 3f. additionally, cl-amidine also dramatically reduced the level of acetylation on the h <dig> tail, namely h3k <dig> acetyl  and h3k <dig> acetyl  . the fluorescent intensities for these modifications were showed in figure 3b and 3d. to gain further insight into the mechanisms by which histone citrullination may regulate gene activity, we also tested whether cl-amidine affected levels of di-methylated histone h3k <dig>  a modification closely associated with transcriptional repression  <cit> . we found that levels of this modification were not significantly affected by cl-amidine treatment . to validate the specificity of the acetylated histone antibodies, the embryos were also treated with the hdac inhibitor trichostatin a , and as expected, staining for acetylated histones  was elevated following tsa treatment . taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of padi-mediated histone citrullination suppresses histone acetylation.

histone hyperacetylation promotes histone citrullination in early embryos
to further explore the potential interplay between histone citrullination and acetylation, the colocalization of citrullination at h3r2 + 8 +  <dig> and acetylation at h3k <dig> was tested in 2-cell embryos. results revealed that these two histone modifications localize, in part, to different regions of the nucleus, and they do appear to colocalize at specific foci in 2-cell embryos . to further test whether there was a potential crosstalk between histone citrullination and acetylation, levels of h3r2 + 8 +  <dig> citrullination were examined in embryos treated with either tsa or cl-amidine. to perform this experiment, pn zygotes were recovered from b6d2f1/j females and cultured in ksom medium supplemented with either  <dig> nm of tsa or  <dig> μm of cl-amidine, respectively, for ~ <dig> hours. results showed that, as expected, levels of h3cit2 + 18 +  <dig> were significantly reduced following cl-amidine treatment . interestingly, however, we found that induction of histone hyperactylation via tsa treatment also resulted in significantly increased levels of citrullination at h3r2 + 8 +  <dig> . this observation further suggests that there is a reinforcing relationship between acetylation and citrullination and further highlights the potential interplay between these two modifications on chromatin in preimplantation mammalian embryos.

CONCLUSIONS
this report is the first to document the presence of citrullinated histones in mammalian oocytes and preimplantation embryos. the use of three site-specific citrullinated histone antibodies found that histone citrullination is likely playing several unique, yet to be defined roles on chromatin templated events. we found that the padi inhibitor, cl-amidine, potently blocks embryonic development beyond the 4-cell stage, thus further highlighting the important role of padis in early development. this observation also raises the possibility that padi inhibitors could potentially be utilized as novel contraceptives. our study also showed that cl-amidine specifically suppressed histone acetylation on the h <dig> and h <dig> tails while not affecting levels of the transcriptionally repressive histone h3k <dig> dimethyl modification. further, we found that induction of histone hyperacetylation leads to enhanced histone citrullination. mechanistically, as with numerous other histone modifications  <cit> , these observations raise the distinct possibility that the citrulline modification on histones may function as a “platform” for binding by histone acetyltransferases , thus facilitating transcriptional activation by enhancing levels of histone acetylation. more detailed studies are now required to test this hypothesis. we predict that outcomes from the current study will likely lead to new and important insight into epigenetic regulation of the oocyte to embryo transition.

"BACKGROUND
the formation of muscle during embryonic development involves the differentiation of myoblasts into long, fibrous cells.
in this differentiation process, myoblasts withdraw from the cell cycle and fuse into multinucleate, syncytial myotubes  <cit> .
the microtubule cytoskeleton is reorganized from a radial network into a parallel array of filaments aligned along the long axis of the cells  <cit> .
it is believed that this reorganization is a prerequisite for the elongation and fusion of myoblasts, and for the subsequent alignment and organization of sarcomeres  <cit> .
microtubule reorganization is paralleled by reorganization of centrosomal proteins: myoblasts possess a morphologically recognizable centrosome with characteristic marker proteins concentrated in the pericentriolar material, whereas myotubes show perinuclear localization of a multitude of centrosome proteins  <cit> .
consequently, polymerization of microtubules is initiated in part from the surface of the nucleus  <cit> .
it has been reported that reorganization of microtubules and relocalization of centrosome proteins to the nuclear surface occurs after fusion of myoblasts into myotubes  <cit> .
however, the precise kinetics of this reorganization are unknown.
morover, it is unknown how centrosome proteins are attached to the nuclear surface, and how they are organized at the ultrastructural level.
RESULTS
in order to determine at what stage of the differentiation process relocalization of centrosome proteins occurs, we performed cell culture of mouse c2c <dig> myoblasts and triggered differentiation by serum withdrawal.
alternatively, we used h-2kb-tsa <dig> mouse myoblasts, carrying a thermolabile t-antigen and allowing differentiation upon temperature shift from  <dig> to 37°c  <cit> .
in the undifferentiated state, the centrosomal proteins of both cell lines were found in a single focus within the pericentriolar material adjacent to the nucleus, while the protein pcm- <dig>  localized to multiple 'centriolar satellites', as described by  <cit>  and  <cit> .
one day after differentiation of myoblasts was triggered, we observed centrosome proteins at the nuclear periphery already at the single cell stage, prior to fusion into myotubes .
we investigated the pattern of various proteins and found that significant amounts of pericentrin and pcm- <dig> accumulated at the nuclear periphery, whereas the centrosome protein cdk5rap <dig> showed partial relocalization.
only minor amounts of gamma-tubulin were found at the nuclear periphery, consistent with data from  <cit> , and the protein ninein was not found to relocalize to the nuclear periphery in our experiments.
a closer look at differentiating c2c <dig> cells revealed that at the single cell stage, proteins such as pericentrin and pcm- <dig> started to accumulate at the nuclear periphery in the proximity of the centrosome, whereas areas of the nuclear envelope distal from the centrosome showed less centrosome protein enrichment .
at the same time, remnant pericentrin and cdk5rap <dig> were still visible at the centrosome, and pcm- <dig> was still partly localized in pericentriolar satellites .
the early relocalization of these proteins from the centrosome to nearby sites of the nuclear surface raises the question as to whether direct transfer from the centrosome is involved, or whether the proteins are recruited to the nuclear surface from a soluble cytoplasmic pool.
both scenarios seem possible: direct transfer from the centrosome to the nucleus might occur by diffusion.
alternatively, at the onset of differentiation, proteins such as pericentrin might be recruited from a soluble pool and localize to the nuclear surface next to the centrosome due to minus-end directed transport along microtubules  <cit> , since the microtubule-organizing centre in these myoblasts is strongly focused at the centrosome and would thus favour deposit of pericentrin in the surrounding area .
it is noteworthy, however, that already at the single cell stage microtubules were reorganized into a sun-like array radiating from the nuclear periphery within those cells displaying perinuclear relocalization of centrosome proteins .
to verify that these cells had indeed entered the differentiation programme, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy with differentiation markers.
we noticed that all cells in which the centrosome protein pcm- <dig> had relocalized to the nuclear surface showed cytoplasmic expression of embryonic myosin, an isoform of myosin that is specifically expressed upon onset of muscle cell differentiation .
furthermore, these cells expressed the differentiation marker myogenin, a transcription factor that localizes to the nucleus of differentiating cells .
this marker was absent from cells showing pericentriolar pcm- <dig> staining.
conversely, these cells with pericentriolar pcm- <dig> were the only ones that stained positively for the proliferation marker ki- <dig> in the nucleus, whereas nuclei in cells with relocalized pcm- <dig> did not contain ki- <dig> .
once relocalization of pcm- <dig> occurred, it persisted until the final stages of differentiation: we detected pcm- <dig> around the nuclear surface after fusion of multiple c2c <dig> cells into myotubes .
moreover, nuclei in muscle from adult mice showed comparable staining of pcm- <dig> at their surface .
we next sought to determine whether centrosome proteins that had assembled around the nucleus were bound at the inside or at the outside of the nuclear envelope.
for this purpose, we transfected mouse myoblasts with gfp-tagged lamin a, a protein of the inner nuclear envelope.
deconvolution microscopy revealed that the centrosome protein pcm- <dig> localized in a rim slightly outside of lamin a , suggesting that pcm- <dig> associates with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope.
because the pcm- <dig> staining at the nuclear surface was visible in small clusters, we tested whether these sites co-localized with nuclear pores.
however, double immunofluorescence with an antibody against a family of nuclear pore complex proteins indicated that most of the pcm- <dig> clusters were distinct from nuclear pores .
to reveal further structural details, we performed immuno-electron microscopy of ultra-thin cryosections of differentiated c2c <dig> cells.
pcm- <dig> was detected with antibodies and gold-coupled protein a. this technique preserved cellular membranes and showed that pcm- <dig> localized mainly outside the nucleus, away from the outer nuclear membrane .
consistent with our immunofluorescence data, immunogold labelling of pcm- <dig> was often seen in clusters .
the gold was mostly seen along grey electron-dense material surrounding the nuclear surface .
this electron-dense material had a thickness between  <dig> and  <dig> nm, suggesting that was part of a tight matrix.
to test for the biochemical behaviour of perinuclear pcm-1-containing material, we purified nuclei from differentiated c2c <dig> cells that had fused into myotubes.
these were separated from non-differentiated myoblasts by short treatment of cultures with trypsin, leading to selective enrichment of the differentiated cells.
following fractionation of cells, we performed extraction of purified nuclei with buffer containing various concentrations of salt, detergents, or urea.
we found that perinuclear pcm- <dig> localization was largely resistant to  <dig>  m nacl, to treatment with 1% triton x- <dig>  or even to extraction with  <dig> m urea .
however, pcm- <dig> was efficiently removed from the nuclear surface in  <dig> m urea, or in buffer containing the denaturing detergent sds  .
nuclei treated with sds lost their integrity even after short times of treatment, and could therefore not be quantified reproducibly.
altogether, these results indicate that pcm- <dig> is part of an insoluble matrix in differentiated muscle cells.
taking into account that several centrosome proteins form a fibrous meshwork surrounding the centrioles in undifferentiated cells  <cit> , it seems plausible to assume that a similar fibrous meshwork forms around the nucleus during differentiation.
proteins such as pericentrin that have large predicted alpha-helical domains, and the potential to form coiled-coil interactions, might contribute to the formation of such a meshwork.
to further characterize the nature of the perinuclear meshwork of centrosome proteins, we designed an in-vitro-approach to determine whether its formation was reversible in differentiated c2c <dig> cells upon re-entry into the cell cycle.
because muscle cells become postmitotic after differentiation, as shown by the lack of ki- <dig> staining , cultures of differentiated c2c <dig> cells could not simply be driven into mitosis.
to circumvent this problem, we isolated nuclei from differentiated cells and incubated them in cycling egg extracts from xenopus laevis .
these extracts are capable of mimicking cell cycle events such as s-phase and mitosis in vitro, and assemble mitotic spindles around various sources of dna, including exogenously added nuclei .
we noticed that upon entry of these extracts into a prometaphase-like state, c2c <dig> nuclei began to disassemble.
dna condensed into mitotic chromosomes, and the perinuclear 'matrix' of pcm- <dig> disintegrated into a system of interwoven fibres, and finally disassembled into protein aggregates of varying sizes .
we performed deconvolution microscopy on nuclei, stained with various markers, in s-phase and prometaphase.
we found that pcm- <dig>  pericentrin, gamma-tubulin, as well as the nuclear envelope protein nesprin  <dig> localized to patches on the nuclear envelope that were closely apposed, but without fully co-localizing with each other .
in samples that had entered prometaphase, we found that pcm- <dig>  pericentrin, and nesprin  <dig> localized to spots and interconnected fibres that co-localized partly, whereas gamma-tubulin was found more diffusely distributed .
we therefore believe that pcm- <dig> and pericentrin form distinct fibrillar structures at the outer nuclear surface that are connected at various contact sites, thus constituting a tight matrix.
this matrix may be structurally equivalent to the fibrous pericentriolar material in undifferentiated cells, and it can be disassembled or at least loosened upon entry into mitosis.
consistently, many centrosome proteins, including pcm- <dig> and pericentrin, are seen in undifferentiated cells during mitosis in a wide crescent-shaped area at the spindle poles or diffuse in the cytoplasm, whereas in interphase they are more focused at the centrosome  <cit> .
CONCLUSIONS
in this manuscript, we demonstrate that relocalization of centrosome proteins to the nuclear surface is an early event during the differentiation of myoblasts, which occurs prior to their fusion into myotubes.
this may imply that the relocalization is important for subsequent differentiation events, for example by affecting microtubule organization.
further, we show that centrosome proteins form a filamentous matrix around the outer surface of the nuclear envelope.
our biochemical experiments demonstrate that this matrix is highly insoluble, but disassembles in mitotic cytoplasm.
the assembly and disassembly characteristics of this matrix may provide general insights into the organization of the pericentriolar material of centrosome proteins.
future work will be needed to determine the molecular mechanisms that lead to re-localization of centrosome proteins to the nuclear surface upon muscular differentiation.

","during this differentiation process, the cytoskeleton is reorganized, and proteins of the centrosome re-localize to the surface of the nucleus.
because we observe that centrosome protein re-localization occurs early during differentiation, we believe that it is of functional importance for the reorganization of the cytoskeleton in the differentiation process.

","BACKGROUND
muscle fibres are formed by elongation and fusion of myoblasts into myotubes. during this differentiation process, the cytoskeleton is reorganized, and proteins of the centrosome re-localize to the surface of the nucleus. the exact timing of this event, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood.


RESULTS
we performed studies on mouse myoblast cell lines that were induced to differentiate in culture, to characterize the early events of centrosome protein re-localization. we demonstrate that this re-localization occurs already at the single cell stage, prior to fusion into myotubes. centrosome proteins that accumulate at the nuclear surface form an insoluble matrix that can be reversibly disassembled if isolated nuclei are exposed to mitotic cytoplasm from xenopus egg extract. our microscopy data suggest that this perinuclear matrix of centrosome proteins consists of a system of interconnected fibrils.


CONCLUSIONS
our data provide new insights into the reorganization of centrosome proteins during muscular differentiation, at the structural and biochemical level. because we observe that centrosome protein re-localization occurs early during differentiation, we believe that it is of functional importance for the reorganization of the cytoskeleton in the differentiation process.

"BACKGROUND
the insulin-like growth factor  system is important for development and tissue growth in livestock species.
insulin-like growth factor- <dig>  is primarily synthesized by the liver and is crucial for stimulating cellular proliferation and differentiation in brain, muscle, and bone tissue  <cit> .
the expression of igf- <dig> is mediated by growth hormone , a peptide hormone released by the anterior pituitary gland  <cit> .
the binding of gh to growth hormone receptors  in hepatic tissue induces expression of igf- <dig>  <cit> .
igf- <dig> expression is associated with increased body weight as demonstrated by transgenic over-expression of igf- <dig> in mice  <cit> .
the transportation and bioavailability of igf- <dig> is facilitated by igf binding proteins  which circulate in the blood  <cit> .
the most abundant is igfbp- <dig> which binds most circulating igf- <dig>  <cit> .
experiments using a transgenic mouse model have demonstrated that over-expression of igfbp- <dig> is associated with growth impediment  <cit> .
in pigs, previous research suggests that serum igf- <dig> is positively associated with average daily gain  and serum igfbp- <dig> is negatively associated with adg  <cit> .
additional studies have demonstrated that the igf system is important for postnatal maturation and the development of desirable carcass traits  <cit> .
although these findings demonstrate that the igf system plays an important role in development, it is not clear to what extent differences in gene expression affect growth performance in pigs, and whether these genes can be used as biomarkers to monitor growth performance across different commercial farms.
there are previous studies which also suggest that growth performance in pigs may be associated with changes in serum concentrations of acute-phase proteins , including c-reactive protein , haptoglobin , and serum amyloid a   <cit> .
it has been proposed that hp may be a suitable biomarker for monitoring production performance on commercial swine farms  <cit> .
serum levels of certain cytokines, including interleukin-1β , interleukin- <dig> , interleukin- <dig> , interleukin- <dig> , and tumor necrosis factor-α , have also been associated with body weight in horses and in humans  <cit> .
however, the usefulness of these apps and cytokines as biomarkers for monitoring the growth performance of pigs on commercial swine farms has not been established.
the objective of this study was to investigate the association between the hepatic gene expression of potential biomarkers, including igf- <dig>  igfbp- <dig>  ghr, crp, saa, hp, ifn-α, ifn-γ, tnf-α, il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and growth performance in nursery pigs across diverse commercial farm conditions.
a secondary objective of this study was to determine extraneous factors which may influence growth performance in the nursery as such factors are critical for assessing the association between potential biomarkers and nursery performance.
methods
experimental design and sampling
the use of animals in this study was approved by the animal care committee at the university of guelph.
eight swine farms in southern ontario were recruited to participate in a collaborative field study.
on each farm, seven sows were randomly enrolled in the study and three piglets  were selected from each sow at weaning and ear tagged.
in total  <dig> piglets  were included.
all male piglets recruited in this study were castrated.
a questionnaire was administered and information about the enrolled sows , farm management , health status , vaccination, and in-feed drug use was collected.
piglets were weighed at weaning and once again at 5 weeks post-weaning.
fecal and blood samples were collected at weaning, 2 weeks post-weaning, and 5 weeks post-weaning.
at 5 weeks post-weaning the piglets were transported to the university of guelph where they were euthanized.
tissue samples collected immediately from the liver, intestinal lymph node, ileum, and spleen were placed immediately into rnalater and allowed to sit at 4°c for 24 h before being stored at -80°c.
samples were stored at -80°c for no longer than 4 weeks before being processed for gene expression analysis.
separate portions of the ileum and colon were collected and nasal swabs, blood, and fecal samples were collected from each pig prior to euthanasia.
calculating growth performance
growth performance was determined by assessing the post-weaning adg and the 9 week body weight  of each nursery piglet.
adg was calculated as the difference between the weaning weight and the 5-wk post-weaning weight, divided by the number of days between each weighing.
body weights were standardized to 9 weeks of age as there was considerable variation in piglet age within each farm and between farms.
body weights were standardized to 9 weeks of age as the mean age at the second weighing was  <dig>  d.
rna extraction
seventy-four pigs from  <dig> representative farms with different health status and production parameters were included for gene expression analysis.
rna was extracted from liver tissue using a qiagen rneasy mini kit .
approximately 30 mg of liver tissue was added to 600 μl of rlt buffer in a rnase-free tube and homogenized for 30–40 sec using a tissue homogenizer .
rna was then extracted from the homogenate as outlined by the manufacturer’s protocol without any modifications .
the concentration of the eluted rna was determined using the thermo scientific nanodrop  <dig> spectrophotometer , and rna was re-extracted from samples with signs of degradation or contamination.
all rna samples were treated with an amplification grade dnase i kit  to remove any genomic dna.
24 μl of nucleic acid-free water, 3 μl of reaction buffer, 3 μl of amplification grade dnase i, and 3 μg of total rna  were added together and centrifuged for 10 seconds to collect the reaction at the bottom of the tube.
the mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 15 min.
3 μl of the stop solution  was added and the mixtures were incubated at 70°c for 10 min.
the mixtures were then chilled on ice before being stored at -80°c.
the purity and concentration of rna was reassessed after dnase digestion using the thermo scientific nanodrop  <dig> spectrophotometer .
the integrity of all the rna samples was assessed using the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer  before and after dnase treatment to ensure there was no indication of degradation.
the mean rna integrity number  was  <dig> , and any samples with rin <  <dig>  were repeated as recommended by fleige and pfaffl  <cit> .
primer design and efficiency
primer designs and efficiencies are listed in table  <dig>  primers for il-1β, il- <dig>  ifn-α, and ifn-γ were previously designed by collado-romero et al.
<cit> .
all other primer sequences were designed and screened for homology using the ncbi primer-blast program.
the cdna sequences used to design the primers were obtained from the genbank database.
primers were designed to span known exon-exon junctions.
primer efficiency and the coefficient of determination  were determined using the steponeplus™ real-time pcr system .

analysis of gene expression with rt-qpcr
relative gene expression was assessed using a real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction  assay.
the synthesis of cdna and the rt-qpcr assay were completed by the advanced analysis centre’s genomic facility at the university of guelph.
for synthesis of cdna, 1000 ng of total rna was reverse transcribed into cdna using the high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit .
a total reaction volume of 20 μl was used for reverse transcription; 2 μl of reverse transcript buffer,  <dig>  μl  dntp, 2 μl random priming oligonucleotides , 1 μl of multiscribe™ reverse transcriptase  ,  <dig>  μl of nucleic acid-free water, and 10 μl  of total rna.
the reverse transcription assay was run at 25°c for 5 min, 37°c for 120 min, 85°c for 5 min, and cooled at 4°c.
gapdh and rlp <dig> were evaluated as potential reference genes for the present study based on validation and reliable performance in previous research  <cit> .
the stability of these reference genes in the liver tissue samples was measured using rt-qpcr and analyzed using bestkeeper software  <cit> .
the rt-qpcr cycle quantification  values of gapdh and rlp <dig> had standard deviations of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.
gapdh was chosen as the only endogenous reference gene to be used for internal normalization of gene expression data in this study due to its very low variability  for the present samples and its reliable performance as a sole reference gene in previous studies  <cit> .
a single steponeplus™ real-time pcr system  was used for all rt-qpcr assays in this study.
the rt-qpcr assay was completed using duplicates of each sample.
each 20 μl reaction consisted of  <dig>  μl of 2× perfecta sybr green fastmix rox , 5 μl of template cdna,  <dig>  μl of molecular grade water, and  <dig>  μl of primer.
the final primer concentration in each reaction was  <dig> nm.
the rt-qpcr assay conditions were 95°c for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of 95°c for 15 s and 60°c for 30 s. a melting curve was performed to confirm specificity of the amplicon.
statistical analysis
linear regression methods were used to model production parameters and gene expression  in relation to growth performance.
first, the cq values of each biomarker were normalized using the cq values of the endogenous reference gene gapdh as described by the following equation:
Δcq=cqoftargetgene–cqofreferencegene
the normalized Δcq values already exist as the log transformed product of the expression ratios that are conventionally calculated using the 2-ΔΔct method  <cit> , thereby fulfilling the assumption of linearity.
the linearity of the Δcq data was confirmed by assessing a smoothed locally weighted scatterplot.
the Δcq values were modelled as the magnitude of gene expression for each target gene.
one multivariable random-effect generalized least squares  model and two multivariable fixed-effect least squares dummy variable  models were created in stata  <dig>  .
the gls model was designed to evaluate the association of production characteristics with 9-wk bw across the  <dig> farms.
the two lsdv models were designed to determine the association of biomarker expression with adg and 9-wk bw across  <dig> farms.
extraneous variables that were used for model building include the farm, parity of the sow, stillbirths per litter, live births per litter, sex of the piglet, age at weaning, weight at weaning, and disease status.
each model was manually designed using a parsimonious approach.
all variables were first screened individually with univariable linear regression.
variables with a liberal p-value of ≤ <dig>  were included in the initial model.
all variables regardless of inclusion were evaluated for confounding.
a variable was determined to be a confounder if its inclusion in the model changed the coefficient of any predictor by ≥20%.
two-way interactions were generated for all variables in the initial model and interactions were retained in the model if they were statistically significant .
any variable from the initial model was only retained in the final model if it was statistically significant , if the variable behaved as a confounder, or if the variable was a component of a statistically significant interaction term.
if two independent variables presented colinearity  then the less significant variable was excluded.
clustering at the farm level was accounted for by modelling each farm as a random-effect in the gls model and as a fixed-effect in the lsdv models.
homoskedasticity and normal distribution of standardized residuals was assessed graphically for the gls model.
the assumptions of constant variance and normal distribution of standardized residuals was evaluated for each lsdv model using the cook-weisberg test and the shapiro-wilk test, respectively.
diagnostic analysis revealed no outliers or extremely influential observations.
however, observations for two pigs were excluded from the model due to missing data.
effects with a p <  <dig>  were considered statistically significant and non-significant effects with a p <  <dig>  were considered to be suggestive of an association.
all descriptive statistics are reported as the mean ± standard deviation.

discussion
the weight at weaning and the age at weaning both contributed significantly to growth performance in nursery pigs.
the weight at weaning was positively associated with body weight during the nursery period which is consistent with results from previous studies  <cit> .
additional research has demonstrated that pigs with higher weaning weights reach market weight 9–15 days earlier  <cit> .
these results support the importance of pre-weaning interventions that improve weight at weaning and subsequent performance in the nursery.
growth performance was negatively associated with age at weaning which implies that pigs weaned at an earlier age will reach a greater body weight during the nursery stage.
this finding is in agreement with previous research which indicates that late weaning is disadvantageous for post-weaning growth performance  <cit> .
research by main et al.
determined that weaning at  <dig>  d is optimal for nursery performance in multisite production systems  <cit> .
in the present study,  <dig> % of the piglets were > <dig>  d old at weaning which is indicative of the negative association observed between weaning age and post-weaning growth performance.
the sex of the piglet was not associated with growth performance in the nursery.
these findings consistently agree with previous research  <cit> .
growth performance of gilts and barrows appears to be significantly different only during the grower-finisher phase of production  <cit> .
paredes et al.
demonstrated that sex can be significantly associated with nursery performance in different data sets although the authors attributed this consequence to differences in the proportion of intact males  <cit> .
in the present study, all male piglets had been castrated prior to weaning.
litter characteristics were not associated with nursery growth performance.
the parity of the sow, stillbirths per litter, and live births per litter showed no effect on 9-wk bw.
there are conflicting reports of the effects of sow parity on post-weaning growth performance.
a study by smith et al.
suggests that piglets born to primiparous sows have a growth disadvantage compared to higher parity sows  <cit> .
however, the authors noted that the mean post-weaning weights varied greatly among parties and there was no discernible pattern of growth performance.
other researchers have concluded that sow party does not influence growth performance at the nursery stage  <cit> .
in addition, previous findings have demonstrated that the number of live births per litter is not associated with post-weaning growth performance  <cit> , although the number of live births does appear to be associated with birth weight  <cit> .
one reason for lack of association between sow characteristics and growth performance in this study may have resulted from selecting three piglets of small, medium, and large size from each sow.
increased expression of igf- <dig> in the liver showed a tendency to be positively associated with adg and 9-wk bw.
this is consistent with other studies which have determined that serum igf- <dig> concentration is positively associated with growth in pigs and other animals  <cit> .
furthermore, over-expression of igf- <dig> at  <dig> -fold the normal levels in transgenic mice resulted in a 30% increase in body weight  <cit> .
in this study, a smaller effect was observed in pigs with the model predicting that a 2-fold increase in igf- <dig> would result in a  <dig> % increase in body weight at 9 weeks of age for the average nursery pig.
the statistical significance of the association between igf- <dig> and growth may have been undermined by the large variation in igf- <dig> rna levels.
the variation in hepatic igf- <dig> expression is likely due to the natural variability observed during this stage of development  <cit> .
additionally, differences in production management, feed composition, and antimicrobial usage may have contributed to the large variation in hepatic igf- <dig> expression  <cit> .
it is likely that differences in breed and sex across farms were not a factor in variation as previous studies have demonstrated that igf- <dig> levels are not significantly different between breeds  <cit>  or between barrows and gilts  <cit> .
expression of igf- <dig> is likely more useful as a growth-associated biomarker for comparing pigs that are raised in the same herd under the same conditions.
igfbp- <dig> expression in the liver was negatively associated with adg and 9-wk bw.
the model designed in this experiment predicted that a 2-fold increase in igfbp- <dig> expression would reduce 9-wk bw by  <dig> % in the average nursery pig.
contrary to the results of our findings, previous research by owens et al.
showed a weak positive correlation between serum igfbp- <dig> concentration and adg  <cit> .
however, other research has been demonstrated that igfbp- <dig> is expressed significantly less in gilts bred for enhanced growth performance compared to gilts with diminished growth performance  <cit> , and that hepatic expression of igfbp- <dig> is higher in slow-growing breeds than in fast-growing breeds of pigs  <cit> .
further research using transgenic mice found that a  <dig> - <dig> -fold increase in igfbp- <dig> expression resulted in a 10% reduction in birth weight, moderate post-natal growth retardation, and reduced organ weight  <cit> .
over-expression of igfbp- <dig> in transgenic mice also resulted in a  <dig> - <dig> -fold increase in circulating igf- <dig> levels  <cit> , a finding that can be explained by the concomitant mechanisms that regulate both igf- <dig> and igfbp- <dig> expression  <cit> .
it is likely that neglecting to account for igf- <dig> levels during analysis lead owens et al.
to discover a weak positive association between igfbp- <dig> and growth performance  <cit> .
re-modelling the data from our study without igf- <dig> confirmed that igf- <dig> does have a major confounding effect on the igfbp- <dig> coefficient.
overall, the significant negative association between igfbp- <dig> and growth performance found in the present study is consistent with findings in other studies  <cit> .
expression of ghr in the liver was positively associated with growth performance in nursery pigs.
a 2-fold increase in ghr expression appeared to have the greatest effect on the magnitude of growth compared to the same increase in igf- <dig> and igfbp- <dig> expression.
a transgenic experiment with mice demonstrated that deletion of the ghr gene resulted in decreased circulating igf- <dig> and a substantial reduction in body weight  <cit> .
these findings are consistent with the results presented in this paper.
further studies have demonstrated that in vitro ghr expression of swine hepatocytes is significantly influenced by glucose and amino acid concentrations  <cit> , and in vivo experiments with pigs indicate that dietary protein concentration is positively associated with ghr expression in the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue  <cit> .
in light of the results from the present study, assessing expression of ghr may be useful for evaluating the effects of different dietary regiments on growth performance at the molecular level.
adg and 9-wk bw were not associated with hepatic expression of the apps assessed in this study.
a previous experiment by saco et al.
demonstrated that hp is a suitable biomarker for assessing the effects of an immunomodulating feed additive on production parameters  <cit> .
however, saco et al.
were unable to exclusively identify an association between hp and growth performance  <cit> .
additional research by pineiro et al.
demonstrated differential serum concentrations of crp and hp between two groups of pigs subjected to different feeding regiments  <cit> .
although the adg was significantly different between groups, pineiro et al.
attributed the differences in app levels to stress caused by disorderly feeding  <cit> .
in this study it is likely that no significant association was found between app expression and growth performance because app levels are influenced considerably by pathogen colonization and stress  <cit> ; two factors which are not necessarily indicative of growth performance.
the results of the present study indicate that crp, hp, and saa are not suitable biomarkers for evaluating the production performance of nursery pigs on commercial farms.
the expression of ifn-α, ifn-γ, tnf-α, il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> in the liver was not significantly associated with growth performance in nursery pigs.
earlier studies have demonstrated that body weight is significantly associated with circulating levels of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α in humans  <cit> , and differential expression of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α in horses  <cit> .
the lack of association between body weight and hepatic cytokine expression observed in this study is likely due to previous findings which indicate that excess adipose tissue is the primary source of increased levels of circulating cytokines  <cit> .
monitoring adipose-associated cytokines may be useful for evaluating obesity in other species.
overall, cytokine expression in the liver is unsatisfactory for monitoring growth parameters in nursery pigs, although adipose or serum levels of these cytokines may still prove to be useful biomarkers to evaluate growth performance.
one of the limitations of this study was the lack of dietary information for the swine herds.
however, diet is uniform on each farm and farm-level clustering was accounted for in each regression model during the statistical analysis.
furthermore, it may be argued that diet acts as an intervening variable which can introduce considerable variation into the data but would not need to be controlled for the results to be valid.
measuring the hepatic expression of igf- <dig>  igfbp- <dig>  and ghr can be useful biomarkers for evaluating the growth performance of nursery pigs.
it is likely that serological levels of igf- <dig>  igfbp- <dig>  and ghr are representative of the changes in liver expression levels, however further research is needed to confirm this assumption.
the advantages of evaluating gene expression is that it allows for the determination of growth-associated biological activity in specific tissues and it demonstrates that transcriptional diversity is related to overall growth performance.
hence, the results of this study should direct future research to explore whether any polymorphisms in growth factor genes , or accessory genes such as proteases, are associated with transcriptional diversity and indicative of growth performance in pigs.
identifying polymorphisms related to growth factor expression may improve the selection of genetic lineages for enhanced production performance.
quantifying igf- <dig>  igfbp- <dig>  and ghr may also be beneficial in research and experimental settings where they may be used, in addition to conventional methods, to assess interventions, treatments, or clinical pathologies in relation to growth performance of nursery pigs.
future research should focus on whether rna and serum levels of igf- <dig>  igfbp- <dig>  and ghr are indicative of growth performance at other phases of swine production and whether biomarker expression during the nursery phase can predict performance in later phases of production.
CONCLUSIONS
overall, igfbp- <dig> and ghr expression in the liver was significantly associated with growth performance across multiple swine production systems despite variation in operating procedures.
igf- <dig> expression had a tendency to be associated with the measured growth parameters but the large variation reduced its statistical significance in this study.
nevertheless, igf- <dig> is likely a useful biomarker of growth performance for comparing pigs from the same herd.
igfbp- <dig> and ghr appear to be suitable biomarkers for evaluating growth performance in nursery pigs, either in a controlled experimental setting or in population-based studies involving multiple swine herds with varying management practices.
hepatic expression of crp, hp, saa, ifn-α, ifn-γ, tnf-α, il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> was not associated with the growth parameters in this study and appear to be inadequate for monitoring growth in pigs.

the use of animals in this study was approved by the animal care committee at the university of guelph. eight swine farms in southern ontario were recruited to participate in a collaborative field study. on each farm, seven sows were randomly enrolled in the study and three piglets  were selected from each sow at weaning and ear tagged. in total  <dig> piglets  were included. all male piglets recruited in this study were castrated. a questionnaire was administered and information about the enrolled sows , farm management , health status , vaccination, and in-feed drug use was collected. piglets were weighed at weaning and once again at 5 weeks post-weaning. fecal and blood samples were collected at weaning, 2 weeks post-weaning, and 5 weeks post-weaning.

at 5 weeks post-weaning the piglets were transported to the university of guelph where they were euthanized. tissue samples collected immediately from the liver, intestinal lymph node, ileum, and spleen were placed immediately into rnalater and allowed to sit at 4°c for 24 h before being stored at -80°c. samples were stored at -80°c for no longer than 4 weeks before being processed for gene expression analysis. separate portions of the ileum and colon were collected and nasal swabs, blood, and fecal samples were collected from each pig prior to euthanasia.

calculating growth performance
growth performance was determined by assessing the post-weaning adg and the 9 week body weight  of each nursery piglet. adg was calculated as the difference between the weaning weight and the 5-wk post-weaning weight, divided by the number of days between each weighing. body weights were standardized to 9 weeks of age as there was considerable variation in piglet age within each farm and between farms. body weights were standardized to 9 weeks of age as the mean age at the second weighing was  <dig>  d.

rna extraction
seventy-four pigs from  <dig> representative farms with different health status and production parameters were included for gene expression analysis. rna was extracted from liver tissue using a qiagen rneasy mini kit . approximately 30 mg of liver tissue was added to 600 μl of rlt buffer in a rnase-free tube and homogenized for 30–40 sec using a tissue homogenizer . rna was then extracted from the homogenate as outlined by the manufacturer’s protocol without any modifications . the concentration of the eluted rna was determined using the thermo scientific nanodrop  <dig> spectrophotometer , and rna was re-extracted from samples with signs of degradation or contamination.

all rna samples were treated with an amplification grade dnase i kit  to remove any genomic dna. 24 μl of nucleic acid-free water, 3 μl of reaction buffer, 3 μl of amplification grade dnase i, and 3 μg of total rna  were added together and centrifuged for 10 seconds to collect the reaction at the bottom of the tube. the mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. 3 μl of the stop solution  was added and the mixtures were incubated at 70°c for 10 min. the mixtures were then chilled on ice before being stored at -80°c.

the purity and concentration of rna was reassessed after dnase digestion using the thermo scientific nanodrop  <dig> spectrophotometer . the integrity of all the rna samples was assessed using the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer  before and after dnase treatment to ensure there was no indication of degradation. the mean rna integrity number  was  <dig> , and any samples with rin <  <dig>  were repeated as recommended by fleige and pfaffl  <cit> .

primer design and efficiency
primer designs and efficiencies are listed in table  <dig>  primers for il-1β, il- <dig>  ifn-α, and ifn-γ were previously designed by collado-romero et al.  <cit> . all other primer sequences were designed and screened for homology using the ncbi primer-blast program. the cdna sequences used to design the primers were obtained from the genbank database. primers were designed to span known exon-exon junctions. primer efficiency and the coefficient of determination  were determined using the steponeplus™ real-time pcr system .

analysis of gene expression with rt-qpcr
relative gene expression was assessed using a real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction  assay. the synthesis of cdna and the rt-qpcr assay were completed by the advanced analysis centre’s genomic facility at the university of guelph. for synthesis of cdna, 1000 ng of total rna was reverse transcribed into cdna using the high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit . a total reaction volume of 20 μl was used for reverse transcription; 2 μl of reverse transcript buffer,  <dig>  μl  dntp, 2 μl random priming oligonucleotides , 1 μl of multiscribe™ reverse transcriptase  ,  <dig>  μl of nucleic acid-free water, and 10 μl  of total rna. the reverse transcription assay was run at 25°c for 5 min, 37°c for 120 min, 85°c for 5 min, and cooled at 4°c.

gapdh and rlp <dig> were evaluated as potential reference genes for the present study based on validation and reliable performance in previous research  <cit> . the stability of these reference genes in the liver tissue samples was measured using rt-qpcr and analyzed using bestkeeper software  <cit> . the rt-qpcr cycle quantification  values of gapdh and rlp <dig> had standard deviations of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. gapdh was chosen as the only endogenous reference gene to be used for internal normalization of gene expression data in this study due to its very low variability  for the present samples and its reliable performance as a sole reference gene in previous studies  <cit> .

a single steponeplus™ real-time pcr system  was used for all rt-qpcr assays in this study. the rt-qpcr assay was completed using duplicates of each sample. each 20 μl reaction consisted of  <dig>  μl of 2× perfecta sybr green fastmix rox , 5 μl of template cdna,  <dig>  μl of molecular grade water, and  <dig>  μl of primer. the final primer concentration in each reaction was  <dig> nm. the rt-qpcr assay conditions were 95°c for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of 95°c for 15 s and 60°c for 30 s. a melting curve was performed to confirm specificity of the amplicon.

statistical analysis
linear regression methods were used to model production parameters and gene expression  in relation to growth performance. first, the cq values of each biomarker were normalized using the cq values of the endogenous reference gene gapdh as described by the following equation:

  Δcq=cqoftargetgene–cqofreferencegene 

the normalized Δcq values already exist as the log transformed product of the expression ratios that are conventionally calculated using the 2-ΔΔct method  <cit> , thereby fulfilling the assumption of linearity. the linearity of the Δcq data was confirmed by assessing a smoothed locally weighted scatterplot. the Δcq values were modelled as the magnitude of gene expression for each target gene.

one multivariable random-effect generalized least squares  model and two multivariable fixed-effect least squares dummy variable  models were created in stata  <dig>  . the gls model was designed to evaluate the association of production characteristics with 9-wk bw across the  <dig> farms. the two lsdv models were designed to determine the association of biomarker expression with adg and 9-wk bw across  <dig> farms. extraneous variables that were used for model building include the farm, parity of the sow, stillbirths per litter, live births per litter, sex of the piglet, age at weaning, weight at weaning, and disease status. each model was manually designed using a parsimonious approach. all variables were first screened individually with univariable linear regression. variables with a liberal p-value of ≤ <dig>  were included in the initial model. all variables regardless of inclusion were evaluated for confounding. a variable was determined to be a confounder if its inclusion in the model changed the coefficient of any predictor by ≥20%. two-way interactions were generated for all variables in the initial model and interactions were retained in the model if they were statistically significant . any variable from the initial model was only retained in the final model if it was statistically significant , if the variable behaved as a confounder, or if the variable was a component of a statistically significant interaction term. if two independent variables presented colinearity  then the less significant variable was excluded. clustering at the farm level was accounted for by modelling each farm as a random-effect in the gls model and as a fixed-effect in the lsdv models. homoskedasticity and normal distribution of standardized residuals was assessed graphically for the gls model. the assumptions of constant variance and normal distribution of standardized residuals was evaluated for each lsdv model using the cook-weisberg test and the shapiro-wilk test, respectively. diagnostic analysis revealed no outliers or extremely influential observations. however, observations for two pigs were excluded from the model due to missing data. effects with a p <  <dig>  were considered statistically significant and non-significant effects with a p <  <dig>  were considered to be suggestive of an association. all descriptive statistics are reported as the mean ± standard deviation.

discussion
the weight at weaning and the age at weaning both contributed significantly to growth performance in nursery pigs. the weight at weaning was positively associated with body weight during the nursery period which is consistent with results from previous studies  <cit> . additional research has demonstrated that pigs with higher weaning weights reach market weight 9–15 days earlier  <cit> . these results support the importance of pre-weaning interventions that improve weight at weaning and subsequent performance in the nursery.

growth performance was negatively associated with age at weaning which implies that pigs weaned at an earlier age will reach a greater body weight during the nursery stage. this finding is in agreement with previous research which indicates that late weaning is disadvantageous for post-weaning growth performance  <cit> . research by main et al. determined that weaning at  <dig>  d is optimal for nursery performance in multisite production systems  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> % of the piglets were > <dig>  d old at weaning which is indicative of the negative association observed between weaning age and post-weaning growth performance.

the sex of the piglet was not associated with growth performance in the nursery. these findings consistently agree with previous research  <cit> . growth performance of gilts and barrows appears to be significantly different only during the grower-finisher phase of production  <cit> . paredes et al. demonstrated that sex can be significantly associated with nursery performance in different data sets although the authors attributed this consequence to differences in the proportion of intact males  <cit> . in the present study, all male piglets had been castrated prior to weaning.

litter characteristics were not associated with nursery growth performance. the parity of the sow, stillbirths per litter, and live births per litter showed no effect on 9-wk bw. there are conflicting reports of the effects of sow parity on post-weaning growth performance. a study by smith et al. suggests that piglets born to primiparous sows have a growth disadvantage compared to higher parity sows  <cit> . however, the authors noted that the mean post-weaning weights varied greatly among parties and there was no discernible pattern of growth performance. other researchers have concluded that sow party does not influence growth performance at the nursery stage  <cit> . in addition, previous findings have demonstrated that the number of live births per litter is not associated with post-weaning growth performance  <cit> , although the number of live births does appear to be associated with birth weight  <cit> . one reason for lack of association between sow characteristics and growth performance in this study may have resulted from selecting three piglets of small, medium, and large size from each sow.

increased expression of igf- <dig> in the liver showed a tendency to be positively associated with adg and 9-wk bw. this is consistent with other studies which have determined that serum igf- <dig> concentration is positively associated with growth in pigs and other animals  <cit> . furthermore, over-expression of igf- <dig> at  <dig> -fold the normal levels in transgenic mice resulted in a 30% increase in body weight  <cit> . in this study, a smaller effect was observed in pigs with the model predicting that a 2-fold increase in igf- <dig> would result in a  <dig> % increase in body weight at 9 weeks of age for the average nursery pig. the statistical significance of the association between igf- <dig> and growth may have been undermined by the large variation in igf- <dig> rna levels. the variation in hepatic igf- <dig> expression is likely due to the natural variability observed during this stage of development  <cit> . additionally, differences in production management, feed composition, and antimicrobial usage may have contributed to the large variation in hepatic igf- <dig> expression  <cit> . it is likely that differences in breed and sex across farms were not a factor in variation as previous studies have demonstrated that igf- <dig> levels are not significantly different between breeds  <cit>  or between barrows and gilts  <cit> . expression of igf- <dig> is likely more useful as a growth-associated biomarker for comparing pigs that are raised in the same herd under the same conditions.

igfbp- <dig> expression in the liver was negatively associated with adg and 9-wk bw. the model designed in this experiment predicted that a 2-fold increase in igfbp- <dig> expression would reduce 9-wk bw by  <dig> % in the average nursery pig. contrary to the results of our findings, previous research by owens et al. showed a weak positive correlation between serum igfbp- <dig> concentration and adg  <cit> . however, other research has been demonstrated that igfbp- <dig> is expressed significantly less in gilts bred for enhanced growth performance compared to gilts with diminished growth performance  <cit> , and that hepatic expression of igfbp- <dig> is higher in slow-growing breeds than in fast-growing breeds of pigs  <cit> . further research using transgenic mice found that a  <dig> - <dig> -fold increase in igfbp- <dig> expression resulted in a 10% reduction in birth weight, moderate post-natal growth retardation, and reduced organ weight  <cit> . over-expression of igfbp- <dig> in transgenic mice also resulted in a  <dig> - <dig> -fold increase in circulating igf- <dig> levels  <cit> , a finding that can be explained by the concomitant mechanisms that regulate both igf- <dig> and igfbp- <dig> expression  <cit> . it is likely that neglecting to account for igf- <dig> levels during analysis lead owens et al. to discover a weak positive association between igfbp- <dig> and growth performance  <cit> . re-modelling the data from our study without igf- <dig> confirmed that igf- <dig> does have a major confounding effect on the igfbp- <dig> coefficient. overall, the significant negative association between igfbp- <dig> and growth performance found in the present study is consistent with findings in other studies  <cit> .

expression of ghr in the liver was positively associated with growth performance in nursery pigs. a 2-fold increase in ghr expression appeared to have the greatest effect on the magnitude of growth compared to the same increase in igf- <dig> and igfbp- <dig> expression. a transgenic experiment with mice demonstrated that deletion of the ghr gene resulted in decreased circulating igf- <dig> and a substantial reduction in body weight  <cit> . these findings are consistent with the results presented in this paper. further studies have demonstrated that in vitro ghr expression of swine hepatocytes is significantly influenced by glucose and amino acid concentrations  <cit> , and in vivo experiments with pigs indicate that dietary protein concentration is positively associated with ghr expression in the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue  <cit> . in light of the results from the present study, assessing expression of ghr may be useful for evaluating the effects of different dietary regiments on growth performance at the molecular level.

adg and 9-wk bw were not associated with hepatic expression of the apps assessed in this study. a previous experiment by saco et al. demonstrated that hp is a suitable biomarker for assessing the effects of an immunomodulating feed additive on production parameters  <cit> . however, saco et al. were unable to exclusively identify an association between hp and growth performance  <cit> . additional research by pineiro et al. demonstrated differential serum concentrations of crp and hp between two groups of pigs subjected to different feeding regiments  <cit> . although the adg was significantly different between groups, pineiro et al. attributed the differences in app levels to stress caused by disorderly feeding  <cit> . in this study it is likely that no significant association was found between app expression and growth performance because app levels are influenced considerably by pathogen colonization and stress  <cit> ; two factors which are not necessarily indicative of growth performance. the results of the present study indicate that crp, hp, and saa are not suitable biomarkers for evaluating the production performance of nursery pigs on commercial farms.

the expression of ifn-α, ifn-γ, tnf-α, il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> in the liver was not significantly associated with growth performance in nursery pigs. earlier studies have demonstrated that body weight is significantly associated with circulating levels of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α in humans  <cit> , and differential expression of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α in horses  <cit> . the lack of association between body weight and hepatic cytokine expression observed in this study is likely due to previous findings which indicate that excess adipose tissue is the primary source of increased levels of circulating cytokines  <cit> . monitoring adipose-associated cytokines may be useful for evaluating obesity in other species. overall, cytokine expression in the liver is unsatisfactory for monitoring growth parameters in nursery pigs, although adipose or serum levels of these cytokines may still prove to be useful biomarkers to evaluate growth performance.

one of the limitations of this study was the lack of dietary information for the swine herds. however, diet is uniform on each farm and farm-level clustering was accounted for in each regression model during the statistical analysis. furthermore, it may be argued that diet acts as an intervening variable which can introduce considerable variation into the data but would not need to be controlled for the results to be valid.

measuring the hepatic expression of igf- <dig>  igfbp- <dig>  and ghr can be useful biomarkers for evaluating the growth performance of nursery pigs. it is likely that serological levels of igf- <dig>  igfbp- <dig>  and ghr are representative of the changes in liver expression levels, however further research is needed to confirm this assumption. the advantages of evaluating gene expression is that it allows for the determination of growth-associated biological activity in specific tissues and it demonstrates that transcriptional diversity is related to overall growth performance. hence, the results of this study should direct future research to explore whether any polymorphisms in growth factor genes , or accessory genes such as proteases, are associated with transcriptional diversity and indicative of growth performance in pigs. identifying polymorphisms related to growth factor expression may improve the selection of genetic lineages for enhanced production performance. quantifying igf- <dig>  igfbp- <dig>  and ghr may also be beneficial in research and experimental settings where they may be used, in addition to conventional methods, to assess interventions, treatments, or clinical pathologies in relation to growth performance of nursery pigs. future research should focus on whether rna and serum levels of igf- <dig>  igfbp- <dig>  and ghr are indicative of growth performance at other phases of swine production and whether biomarker expression during the nursery phase can predict performance in later phases of production.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, igfbp- <dig> and ghr expression in the liver was significantly associated with growth performance across multiple swine production systems despite variation in operating procedures. igf- <dig> expression had a tendency to be associated with the measured growth parameters but the large variation reduced its statistical significance in this study. nevertheless, igf- <dig> is likely a useful biomarker of growth performance for comparing pigs from the same herd. igfbp- <dig> and ghr appear to be suitable biomarkers for evaluating growth performance in nursery pigs, either in a controlled experimental setting or in population-based studies involving multiple swine herds with varying management practices. hepatic expression of crp, hp, saa, ifn-α, ifn-γ, tnf-α, il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> was not associated with the growth parameters in this study and appear to be inadequate for monitoring growth in pigs.

"BACKGROUND
systematic elucidation of protein-protein interaction networks will be essential for understanding how different behaviors and protein functions are integrated within the cell.
recently, the advent of high-throughput experimental techniques like yeast two-hybrid  assays  <cit>  and co-immunoprecipitation  screens  <cit>  has led to the elucidation of large-scale protein interaction networks in different species, including s. cerevisiae   <cit> , d. melanogaster   <cit> , c. elegans   <cit>  and h. sapiens   <cit> .
these networks, while incorporating thousands or tens of thousands of measured interactions, have so far only partially covered the complete repertoire of protein interactions in an organism, and they have been determined to contain a significant number of false-positive interactions depending on the study  <cit> .
however, recent years have also seen an increase in the accumulation of other sources of biological data such as whole genome sequence, mrna expression, protein expression and functional annotation.
this is particularly advantageous as some of these data sets can be utilized to reinforce true  protein interactions while downgrading others.
for instance, biologically relevant protein interactions have been shown to have high mrna expression correlation for the proteins involved  <cit> .
as a result, many integrative bioinformatic approaches have been developed to unearth true protein-protein interactions.
these can be mainly divided into two categories:  methods that assign reliability measurements to previously observed interactions; and  methods that predict interactions ab initio.
for category , deane et al.
<cit>  and deng et al.
<cit>  introduced methods to tackle the problem of assigning reliabilities to interactions using similarity in mrna expression profiles.
subsequently, bader et al.
<cit>  used additional features of interacting proteins, including functional similarity and high network clustering  <cit> , to assign confidence scores to protein interactions.
for category , marcotte et al.
<cit> , von mering et al.
<cit> , myers et al.
<cit>  and jansen et al.
<cit>  were among the first to predict new protein interactions by incorporating a combination of different features like high mrna expression correlation, functional similarity, co-essentiality, and co-evolution.
these schemes calculate a log-likelihood score for each interaction.
as yet another approach in this category, qi et al.
<cit>  predicted new protein interactions using a method based on random forests.
presumably, the relative performance of each of these approaches versus the others involves a combination of factors such as the types of evidence used as inputs, the efficacy of each classification algorithms, and the sets of true and false interactions used as gold standards during training.
very recently, a second work by qi et al.
<cit>  studied the effect of the underlying classification algorithm by comparing the accuracies of different classifiers such as naïve bayes, logistic regression, and decision trees.
here, we perform a benchmarking analysis to evaluate the published interaction confidence schemes versus one another.
rather than isolate every factor that could influence a scheme's performance, we take a practical approach and evaluate the overall accuracy of each set of confidence scores as reported in the literature and available from the authors' websites.
we limit ourselves to works that have assigned confidence scores to a common set of experimentally-observed interactions in yeast; this includes all of the category  schemes above, as well as the qi.
et al.
scheme from category .
the remaining ab initio schemes are concerned with predicting new interactions and do not assign confidences to those interactions that have already been experimentally observed.
we also assess the performance of a ""null hypothesis"", a uniform scheme that considers the same probability for all interactions.
to compare the quantitative accuracy of the methods, we examine the correlations between the confidence estimates and different biological attributes such as function and expression.
as a further comparison criterion, we apply the signal processing concept of 'signal-to-noise ratio'  to evaluate the significance of protein complexes identified in the network based on the different schemes  <cit> .
the discovery of these complexes depends on the connectivity of the interaction network which, in turn, is influenced by the underlying interaction probabilities  <cit> .
RESULTS
interaction confidence assignment schemes
although large-scale protein interaction networks are being generated for a number of species, s. cerevisiae is perhaps the best studied among them and is associated with the largest variety and quantity of protein interaction data.
hence, most of the interaction probability schemes have been developed using the yeast protein interaction network as a guide.
as the probability schemes were previously computed for different subsets of yeast protein-protein interactions, we compiled a test set of  <dig>  yeast interactions common to all schemes.
these yeast interactions were derived from both yeast two-hybrid  <cit>  and mass-spectrometry-based  <cit>  screens.
in total, we considered seven interaction probability assignment schemes, including bader et al.
<cit>  , deane et al.
<cit> , deng et al.
<cit> , sharan et al.
<cit> , qi et al.
<cit>  and a default scheme, where all interactions are assigned the same probability.
bader et al., sharan et al.
and qi et al.
have assigned specific probabilities to every yeast interaction, while deane et al.
and deng et al.
have grouped yeast interactions into high/medium/low confidence groups.
all of the above schemes define and use some set of gold standard positive and negative interaction examples for the probability estimation.
bader et al.
as a gold standard positive training data set, bader et al.
<cit>  used interactions determined by co-ip, in which the proteins were also one or two links apart in the y2h network.
the negative training data set was selected from interactions reported either by co-ip or y2h, but whose distance  was larger than the median distance in y2h or co-ip respectively.
using these training data, they constructed a logistic regression model that computes the probability of each interaction based on explanatory variables including data source, number of interacting partners, and other topological features like network clustering.
we refer to this scheme as bader et al.
or bader_low in our analysis.
initially, the authors used measures based on gene ontology   <cit>  annotations, co-expression, and presence of genetic interactions as measures to validate their data.
however, they also combined these measurements into the probability score to bolster their confidence of true interactions.
we consider these new confidence scores in our analysis as bader et al.
or bader_high.
deane et al.
deane et al.
<cit>  estimated the reliability of protein-protein interactions using the expression profiles of the interacting partners.
protein interactions observed in small-scale experiments that were also curated in the database of interacting proteins   <cit>  were considered as the gold standard positive interactions.
as a gold standard negative, they randomly picked protein pairs from the yeast proteome that were not reported in dip.
the authors used this information to compute the reliabilities of groups of interactions .
higher reliabilities were assigned to groups whose combined expression profile was closer to the gold standard positive than the gold standard negative interactions.
specifically, reliabilities were assigned to the whole dip database, the set of all protein interactions generated in any high-throughput genome screen, and protein interactions generated by ito et al.
<cit> .
deng et al.
deng et al.
<cit>  estimated the reliabilities of different interaction data sources in a manner similar to deane et al.
<cit> .
they separately considered experiments that report pair-wise interactions like y2h and those that report complex membership like mass spectrometry.
curated pair-wise interactions from the literature and membership in protein complexes from munich information center for protein sequences   <cit>  were used as the gold standard positive set in each case.
randomly chosen protein pairs formed the gold standard negative data set.
reliabilities for each data source were computed using a maximum likelihood scheme based on the expression profiles of each data set.
the authors evaluated reliabilities for y2h data sources like uetz et al.
<cit>  and ito et al.
<cit> , and protein complex data sources like tandem affinity purification   <cit>  and high-throughput mass spectrometric protein complex identification   <cit> .
in addition to assigning reliabilities to each dataset, the authors also provided a conditional probability scheme to compute probabilities for groups of interactions observed in two or more data sources.
this calculation results in assigning a high probability  to yeast interactions observed in more than  <dig> data source.
we use the probabilities generated by this method for our comparative analysis.
sharan et al.
recently, sharan et al.
<cit>  also implemented an interaction probability assignment scheme similar to the one proposed by bader et al.
the scheme assigned probabilities to interactions using a logistic regression model based on mrna expression, interaction clustering and number of times an interaction was observed in independent experiments.
here, we use a modification of this scheme, assigning probabilities to interactions based only on direct experimental evidence.
specifically, interactions with at least two literature references or those that had a distance ≤  <dig> in both the co-ip and y2h networks were defined as the gold standard positives.
conversely, proteins at a distance >  <dig> in the entire network  were defined as the gold standard negatives.
binary variables were used to denote whether the interaction was reported in a co-ip data set, y2h data set, a small-scale experiment or a large-scale experiment.
interaction probabilities were then estimated using logistic regression on the predictor parameters similarly to bader et al.
<cit> .
qi et al.
in this study, the authors used interactions that were observed in small-scale experiments and reported by either dip or bader et al.
as their gold standard positive training data  <cit> .
randomly picked protein pairs were used as the gold standard negative training data.
the method incorporates direct evidence such as the type of experiment used to generate the data and indirect evidence like gene expression, existence of synthetic lethal interactions, and domain-domain interactions to construct a random forest .
the resulting forest is then used to calculate the probability that two proteins interact.
equal probabilities
finally, we also considered the case in which all observed interactions were considered to be equally true.
we refer to this case as equal in the analysis.
a summary of all attributes used as inputs to the different probability schemes is provided in table  <dig>  it should be noted that even though the different probability schemes utilize some of the same types of inputs , they may incorporate these inputs in different ways.
for instance, both sharan and deng use ""experiment type"" as input, but sharan explicitly includes each type of experiment as a separate indicator variable in its logistic regression function, while deng pools data from each experimental type and assigns a single confidence level to the interactions in each pool.
we also compared global statistics such as the average and median probability assigned by each scheme .
we found that most probability schemes had an average probability in the range of .
in contrast, deane et al.
had a very high average and median probability: over half of the interactions in the test set were assigned a probability of  <dig>  we also computed spearman correlations among the different probability schemes to measure their levels of inter-dependency .
the maximum correlation was seen between bader_low and bader_high, as might be expected since both schemes were reported in the same study and bader_high was derived from bader_low.
on the other hand, qi et al.
had very low spearman correlation with any of the probability schemes.
the low correlation may reflect an inherent difference between schemes that assign probabilities to experimentally observed interactions and ones that predict protein interactions ab initio.
the probabilities assigned by the schemes can be obtained from the supplementary website  <cit> .
quality assessment
one of the most objective ways to assess the performance of the different confidence assignment schemes would be to compare their success at correctly classifying a gold standard set of true protein interactions.
however, all of the schemes considered in this analysis had already used the available gold standard sets of known yeast interactions in the training phase of their classifiers and, consequently, assigned high confidence scores to them.
as an alternative approach, we employed five measures that had been shown to associate with true protein interactions  <cit>  to gauge the performance of the schemes.
one caveat of this approach is that, in some cases, one of the measures used to assess a scheme's performance had already been used  as an input to assigning its probabilities.
to avoid circularity, this measure was used only for gauging the performance of the remaining schemes.
for each of the five measures, two ways were used to estimate the level of association: spearman correlation and weighted average .
importantly, by using the spearman correlation coefficient, we are in fact comparing how the schemes rank the interactions, not the absolute scores that are assigned.
note that the equal probability scheme results in spearman correlation of  <dig>  by definition.
presence of conserved interactions in other species
presence of conserved interactions across species is believed to be associated with biologically meaningful interactions  <cit> .
as our benchmark, we used yeast protein interactions that were conserved with measured c. elegans and d. melanogaster interactions obtained from the database of interacting proteins .
an interaction was considered conserved if homologs of the interacting yeast proteins were also interacting in another species.
homologs were based on amino-acid sequence similarity computed using blast  <cit> , thus allowing a protein to possibly match with multiple proteins in the opposite species .
in particular, we allow interactions whose interacting proteins are themselves homologs, but filter cases where both the interacting proteins pointed to the same protein in the other species.
we evaluated the weighted average and spearman correlation between the probability assignment for each yeast interaction and the number of conserved interactions across worm and fly .
we used an e-value cut-off of  <dig> × 10- <dig> to make the homology assignments .
we observed that sharan and bader_high had the highest weighted average and spearman correlation.
not surprisingly, equal had the lowest weighted average.
note that the conserved interactions test is a very strong filter for true interactions as it heavily depends on the level of completeness of the interaction networks of other species being considered.
however, as the underlying set of interactions is the same across the different probability schemes, this filter affects all schemes similarly.
expression correlation
yeast expression data for ~ <dig> conditions were obtained from the stanford microarray database   <cit> .
for every pair of interacting proteins, we computed the pearson correlation coefficient of expression.
we then calculated the spearman correlation and weighted average between the expression correlation coefficients of interacting proteins and their corresponding probability assignments in the different schemes .
we found significant association between expression correlations and probabilities in the case of bader_high, bader_low, qi and deng.
this result is expected as these schemes, with the exception of bader_low, utilize expression similarity for interaction probability calculation.
surprisingly, deane probabilities showed very little correlation with expression, even though mrna expression profiles were used as input in the prediction process reflecting the difference in the way expression similarity is incorporated in this method.
in particular, deane is the only method where expression similarity between two interacting proteins is taken into account as the euclidean distance between their expression profiles versus other methods which incorporated the pearson correlation coefficient of expression.
on the other hand, bader_low had a higher spearman correlation than sharan, though both had very similar weighted averages and did not utilize expression data in the training phase.
gene ontology  similarity
as a first measure, we adopted the common notion that two interacting proteins are frequently involved in the same process and hence should have similar go assignments  <cit> .
the gene ontology terms are represented using a directed acyclic graph data structure in which an edge from term 'a' to term 'b' indicates that term 'b' is either a more specific functional type than term 'a', or is a part of term 'a'.
as a result, terms that appear deeper in the graph are more specific.
moreover, specific terms also have fewer proteins assigned to them or their descendants.
let ""pi"" and ""pj"" be two proteins that have been observed to interact with each other.
to measure their functional similarity, we evaluated the size , represented as ""sij"", of the deepest common go term assignment  shared between them.
thus, a smaller value of sij indicates a greater functional similarity between pi and pj.
in addition, we also found that known yeast interactions generally have lower values for sij than random background .
to ensure that higher values of our go measure correspond to higher performance , we use the negative of sij  to represent the overall go similarity.
signal-to-noise ratio of protein complexes
most cellular processes involve proteins that act together by assembling into functional complexes.
several methods  <cit>  have been developed to identify complexes embedded within a protein interaction network, in which a complex is typically modeled as a densely-connected protein sub-network.
recently, we showed that the quality of these identified protein complexes could be estimated by computing their signal-to-noise ratio , a standard measure used in information theory and signal processing to assess data quality   <cit> .
essentially, snr evaluates the density of complexes found in the protein interaction network against a randomized version of the same network.
as the snr is independent of the number of complexes reported, its value can be directly compared across the different probability schemes.
for discovery of protein complexes, we applied a previously-published algorithm  <cit>  which includes interaction probabilities in the complex identification process.
snr was then computed on the set of complexes identified by each probability scheme.
results are shown in table 4; out of all of the schemes, deng had the highest snr of protein complex detection.
conservation rate coherency
interacting proteins have been shown to evolve at similar rates, probably due to selection pressure to maintain the interaction over time  <cit> .
for every pair of interacting proteins, pi and pj, let ""ri"" and ""rj"" be their respective rates of evolution.
we then computed a ""conservation rate coherency score""  as the negative absolute value of the difference between the evolutionary rates of the two corresponding genes: crij = -| ri - rj |.
the negative absolute value was used to ensure that higher values represent higher performance, consistent with other metrics.
evolutionary rates were obtained from fraser et al.
<cit>  and estimated using nucleotide substitution frequencies.
we calculated the spearman correlation between the values of cr for the interacting proteins and their corresponding probability assignments in the different schemes .
for all probability assignment schemes we obtained a statistically significant correlation  between the conservation rate coherency scores and the corresponding probabilities, indicating that proteins with high probability interactions tend to have similar conservation rates.
the highest correlation was obtained for deng.
discussion
a brief review of the performance results suggests that the deng method  emerges as the clear winner, with top scores in three out of four non-circular quality metrics.
comprising a 'second tier' are bader_high, bader_low  and sharan, which perform very similarly across most metrics with some differences in conservation coherency or gene expression .
bader_low, which considers experiment type and interaction clustering as inputs, has a higher expression score than sharan, which considers experiment type only, implying that interaction clustering helps capture expression similarity.
interestingly, bader_high, which incorporates more input attributes than bader_low or sharan, does not have substantially higher rankings.
thus, in this case, adding more inputs to a probability assignment scheme does not appear to strongly enhance its quality.
as for the remaining schemes with lower overall performance , it is interesting to note that these were arguably the least and most sophisticated schemes, respectively.
the deane method relied on only a single evidence type for assigning confidences, that of gene expression, whereas it appears that other factors may have been more informative .
in contrast to deane, qi had the largest number of inputs for assigning confidences and, among these, included data on both co-expression and experiment type.
however, it is well known that classifier accuracy can be degraded by including many irrelevant input variables  <cit> , and perhaps this is the reason for qi's lower performance.
as an alternative explanation, in qi et al.
's evaluation of classification schemes, they concluded that their method was very successful in predicting co-complex membership, but performed poorly when considering physical interactions  <cit> .
in our analysis, all interactions  were treated as pair-wise protein interactions, and this assumption may have contributed to the poor performance of qi et al.
certainly, their classification method was among the most sophisticated of the schemes that we evaluated, and as such it is worthy of future exploration  regardless of its performance in the present study.
finally, equal almost always scored lowest, regardless of quality metric.
thus, utilizing any probability scheme is better than considering all observed interactions to be true or equally probable.
beyond these broad rankings, is it possible to synthesize data from five largely independent metrics to arrive at an overall quantitative index of performance?
as one approach, we normalized the scores for each metric as a fraction of the best score achieved within that metric over all confidence assignment schemes .
table  <dig> summarises the fractional scores for the six probability schemes and five quality assessment measures.
note that expressing scores as fractional values is an intermediate normalization which preserves the score distribution but compresses its range; although potentially more informative than the non-parametric analysis above based only on ranks, it must also be interpreted with more caution.
however, in this case, the fractional scores reinforce the findings reported above based on rank.
CONCLUSIONS
we have compared and contrasted seven probability assignment schemes for yeast protein interactions.
surprisingly, deng et al.
performs significantly better than others while being one of the least sophisticated.
it assigns discrete probability scores to large groups of interactions rather than to individuals, and it inputs just two lines of evidence, experiment type and expression similarity, rather than many.
generalizing these observations, more complex approaches are so far unable to outperform simpler variants.
thus, we arrive at a somewhat unexpected conclusion: at least in interaction confidence assignment, sometimes less means more.
",500,"BACKGROUND
systematic elucidation of protein-protein interaction networks will be essential for understanding how different behaviors and protein functions are integrated within the cell. recently, the advent of high-throughput experimental techniques like yeast two-hybrid  assays  <cit>  and co-immunoprecipitation  screens  <cit>  has led to the elucidation of large-scale protein interaction networks in different species, including s. cerevisiae   <cit> , d. melanogaster   <cit> , c. elegans   <cit>  and h. sapiens   <cit> . these networks, while incorporating thousands or tens of thousands of measured interactions, have so far only partially covered the complete repertoire of protein interactions in an organism, and they have been determined to contain a significant number of false-positive interactions depending on the study  <cit> . however, recent years have also seen an increase in the accumulation of other sources of biological data such as whole genome sequence, mrna expression, protein expression and functional annotation. this is particularly advantageous as some of these data sets can be utilized to reinforce true  protein interactions while downgrading others. for instance, biologically relevant protein interactions have been shown to have high mrna expression correlation for the proteins involved  <cit> .

as a result, many integrative bioinformatic approaches have been developed to unearth true protein-protein interactions. these can be mainly divided into two categories:  methods that assign reliability measurements to previously observed interactions; and  methods that predict interactions ab initio. for category , deane et al.  <cit>  and deng et al.  <cit>  introduced methods to tackle the problem of assigning reliabilities to interactions using similarity in mrna expression profiles. subsequently, bader et al.  <cit>  used additional features of interacting proteins, including functional similarity and high network clustering  <cit> , to assign confidence scores to protein interactions. for category , marcotte et al.  <cit> , von mering et al.  <cit> , myers et al.  <cit>  and jansen et al.  <cit>  were among the first to predict new protein interactions by incorporating a combination of different features like high mrna expression correlation, functional similarity, co-essentiality, and co-evolution. these schemes calculate a log-likelihood score for each interaction. as yet another approach in this category, qi et al.  <cit>  predicted new protein interactions using a method based on random forests. presumably, the relative performance of each of these approaches versus the others involves a combination of factors such as the types of evidence used as inputs, the efficacy of each classification algorithms, and the sets of true and false interactions used as gold standards during training. very recently, a second work by qi et al.  <cit>  studied the effect of the underlying classification algorithm by comparing the accuracies of different classifiers such as naïve bayes, logistic regression, and decision trees.

here, we perform a benchmarking analysis to evaluate the published interaction confidence schemes versus one another. rather than isolate every factor that could influence a scheme's performance, we take a practical approach and evaluate the overall accuracy of each set of confidence scores as reported in the literature and available from the authors' websites. we limit ourselves to works that have assigned confidence scores to a common set of experimentally-observed interactions in yeast; this includes all of the category  schemes above, as well as the qi. et al. scheme from category . the remaining ab initio schemes are concerned with predicting new interactions and do not assign confidences to those interactions that have already been experimentally observed. we also assess the performance of a ""null hypothesis"", a uniform scheme that considers the same probability for all interactions. to compare the quantitative accuracy of the methods, we examine the correlations between the confidence estimates and different biological attributes such as function and expression. as a further comparison criterion, we apply the signal processing concept of 'signal-to-noise ratio'  to evaluate the significance of protein complexes identified in the network based on the different schemes  <cit> . the discovery of these complexes depends on the connectivity of the interaction network which, in turn, is influenced by the underlying interaction probabilities  <cit> .

RESULTS
interaction confidence assignment schemes
although large-scale protein interaction networks are being generated for a number of species, s. cerevisiae is perhaps the best studied among them and is associated with the largest variety and quantity of protein interaction data. hence, most of the interaction probability schemes have been developed using the yeast protein interaction network as a guide. as the probability schemes were previously computed for different subsets of yeast protein-protein interactions, we compiled a test set of  <dig>  yeast interactions common to all schemes. these yeast interactions were derived from both yeast two-hybrid  <cit>  and mass-spectrometry-based  <cit>  screens.

in total, we considered seven interaction probability assignment schemes, including bader et al.  <cit>  , deane et al.  <cit> , deng et al.  <cit> , sharan et al.  <cit> , qi et al.  <cit>  and a default scheme, where all interactions are assigned the same probability. bader et al., sharan et al. and qi et al. have assigned specific probabilities to every yeast interaction, while deane et al. and deng et al. have grouped yeast interactions into high/medium/low confidence groups. all of the above schemes define and use some set of gold standard positive and negative interaction examples for the probability estimation.

bader et al. 
as a gold standard positive training data set, bader et al.  <cit>  used interactions determined by co-ip, in which the proteins were also one or two links apart in the y2h network. the negative training data set was selected from interactions reported either by co-ip or y2h, but whose distance  was larger than the median distance in y2h or co-ip respectively. using these training data, they constructed a logistic regression model that computes the probability of each interaction based on explanatory variables including data source, number of interacting partners, and other topological features like network clustering. we refer to this scheme as bader et al.  or bader_low in our analysis.

initially, the authors used measures based on gene ontology   <cit>  annotations, co-expression, and presence of genetic interactions as measures to validate their data. however, they also combined these measurements into the probability score to bolster their confidence of true interactions. we consider these new confidence scores in our analysis as bader et al.  or bader_high.

deane et al. 
deane et al.  <cit>  estimated the reliability of protein-protein interactions using the expression profiles of the interacting partners. protein interactions observed in small-scale experiments that were also curated in the database of interacting proteins   <cit>  were considered as the gold standard positive interactions. as a gold standard negative, they randomly picked protein pairs from the yeast proteome that were not reported in dip. the authors used this information to compute the reliabilities of groups of interactions . higher reliabilities were assigned to groups whose combined expression profile was closer to the gold standard positive than the gold standard negative interactions. specifically, reliabilities were assigned to the whole dip database, the set of all protein interactions generated in any high-throughput genome screen, and protein interactions generated by ito et al.  <cit> .

deng et al. 
deng et al.  <cit>  estimated the reliabilities of different interaction data sources in a manner similar to deane et al.  <cit> . they separately considered experiments that report pair-wise interactions like y2h and those that report complex membership like mass spectrometry. curated pair-wise interactions from the literature and membership in protein complexes from munich information center for protein sequences   <cit>  were used as the gold standard positive set in each case. randomly chosen protein pairs formed the gold standard negative data set. reliabilities for each data source were computed using a maximum likelihood scheme based on the expression profiles of each data set. the authors evaluated reliabilities for y2h data sources like uetz et al.  <cit>  and ito et al.  <cit> , and protein complex data sources like tandem affinity purification   <cit>  and high-throughput mass spectrometric protein complex identification   <cit> . in addition to assigning reliabilities to each dataset, the authors also provided a conditional probability scheme to compute probabilities for groups of interactions observed in two or more data sources. this calculation results in assigning a high probability  to yeast interactions observed in more than  <dig> data source. we use the probabilities generated by this method for our comparative analysis.

sharan et al. 
recently, sharan et al.  <cit>  also implemented an interaction probability assignment scheme similar to the one proposed by bader et al. the scheme assigned probabilities to interactions using a logistic regression model based on mrna expression, interaction clustering and number of times an interaction was observed in independent experiments. here, we use a modification of this scheme, assigning probabilities to interactions based only on direct experimental evidence. specifically, interactions with at least two literature references or those that had a distance ≤  <dig> in both the co-ip and y2h networks were defined as the gold standard positives. conversely, proteins at a distance >  <dig> in the entire network  were defined as the gold standard negatives. binary variables were used to denote whether the interaction was reported in a co-ip data set, y2h data set, a small-scale experiment or a large-scale experiment. interaction probabilities were then estimated using logistic regression on the predictor parameters similarly to bader et al.  <cit> .

qi et al. 
in this study, the authors used interactions that were observed in small-scale experiments and reported by either dip or bader et al. as their gold standard positive training data  <cit> . randomly picked protein pairs were used as the gold standard negative training data. the method incorporates direct evidence such as the type of experiment used to generate the data and indirect evidence like gene expression, existence of synthetic lethal interactions, and domain-domain interactions to construct a random forest . the resulting forest is then used to calculate the probability that two proteins interact.

equal probabilities 
finally, we also considered the case in which all observed interactions were considered to be equally true. we refer to this case as equal in the analysis.

a summary of all attributes used as inputs to the different probability schemes is provided in table  <dig>  it should be noted that even though the different probability schemes utilize some of the same types of inputs , they may incorporate these inputs in different ways. for instance, both sharan and deng use ""experiment type"" as input, but sharan explicitly includes each type of experiment as a separate indicator variable in its logistic regression function, while deng pools data from each experimental type and assigns a single confidence level to the interactions in each pool.

we also compared global statistics such as the average and median probability assigned by each scheme . we found that most probability schemes had an average probability in the range of . in contrast, deane et al.  had a very high average and median probability: over half of the interactions in the test set were assigned a probability of  <dig>  we also computed spearman correlations among the different probability schemes to measure their levels of inter-dependency . the maximum correlation was seen between bader_low and bader_high, as might be expected since both schemes were reported in the same study and bader_high was derived from bader_low. on the other hand, qi et al.  had very low spearman correlation with any of the probability schemes. the low correlation may reflect an inherent difference between schemes that assign probabilities to experimentally observed interactions and ones that predict protein interactions ab initio. the probabilities assigned by the schemes can be obtained from the supplementary website  <cit> .

quality assessment
one of the most objective ways to assess the performance of the different confidence assignment schemes would be to compare their success at correctly classifying a gold standard set of true protein interactions. however, all of the schemes considered in this analysis had already used the available gold standard sets of known yeast interactions in the training phase of their classifiers and, consequently, assigned high confidence scores to them. as an alternative approach, we employed five measures that had been shown to associate with true protein interactions  <cit>  to gauge the performance of the schemes. one caveat of this approach is that, in some cases, one of the measures used to assess a scheme's performance had already been used  as an input to assigning its probabilities. to avoid circularity, this measure was used only for gauging the performance of the remaining schemes. for each of the five measures, two ways were used to estimate the level of association: spearman correlation and weighted average . importantly, by using the spearman correlation coefficient, we are in fact comparing how the schemes rank the interactions, not the absolute scores that are assigned. note that the equal probability scheme results in spearman correlation of  <dig>  by definition.

presence of conserved interactions in other species
presence of conserved interactions across species is believed to be associated with biologically meaningful interactions  <cit> . as our benchmark, we used yeast protein interactions that were conserved with measured c. elegans and d. melanogaster interactions obtained from the database of interacting proteins . an interaction was considered conserved if homologs of the interacting yeast proteins were also interacting in another species. homologs were based on amino-acid sequence similarity computed using blast  <cit> , thus allowing a protein to possibly match with multiple proteins in the opposite species . in particular, we allow interactions whose interacting proteins are themselves homologs, but filter cases where both the interacting proteins pointed to the same protein in the other species. we evaluated the weighted average and spearman correlation between the probability assignment for each yeast interaction and the number of conserved interactions across worm and fly . we used an e-value cut-off of  <dig> × 10- <dig> to make the homology assignments . we observed that sharan and bader_high had the highest weighted average and spearman correlation. not surprisingly, equal had the lowest weighted average. note that the conserved interactions test is a very strong filter for true interactions as it heavily depends on the level of completeness of the interaction networks of other species being considered. however, as the underlying set of interactions is the same across the different probability schemes, this filter affects all schemes similarly.

expression correlation
yeast expression data for ~ <dig> conditions were obtained from the stanford microarray database   <cit> . for every pair of interacting proteins, we computed the pearson correlation coefficient of expression. we then calculated the spearman correlation and weighted average between the expression correlation coefficients of interacting proteins and their corresponding probability assignments in the different schemes . we found significant association between expression correlations and probabilities in the case of bader_high, bader_low, qi and deng. this result is expected as these schemes, with the exception of bader_low, utilize expression similarity for interaction probability calculation. surprisingly, deane probabilities showed very little correlation with expression, even though mrna expression profiles were used as input in the prediction process reflecting the difference in the way expression similarity is incorporated in this method. in particular, deane is the only method where expression similarity between two interacting proteins is taken into account as the euclidean distance between their expression profiles versus other methods which incorporated the pearson correlation coefficient of expression. on the other hand, bader_low had a higher spearman correlation than sharan, though both had very similar weighted averages and did not utilize expression data in the training phase.

gene ontology  similarity
as a first measure, we adopted the common notion that two interacting proteins are frequently involved in the same process and hence should have similar go assignments  <cit> . the gene ontology terms are represented using a directed acyclic graph data structure in which an edge from term 'a' to term 'b' indicates that term 'b' is either a more specific functional type than term 'a', or is a part of term 'a'. as a result, terms that appear deeper in the graph are more specific. moreover, specific terms also have fewer proteins assigned to them or their descendants.

let ""pi"" and ""pj"" be two proteins that have been observed to interact with each other. to measure their functional similarity, we evaluated the size , represented as ""sij"", of the deepest common go term assignment  shared between them. thus, a smaller value of sij indicates a greater functional similarity between pi and pj. in addition, we also found that known yeast interactions generally have lower values for sij than random background . to ensure that higher values of our go measure correspond to higher performance , we use the negative of sij  to represent the overall go similarity.

signal-to-noise ratio of protein complexes
most cellular processes involve proteins that act together by assembling into functional complexes. several methods  <cit>  have been developed to identify complexes embedded within a protein interaction network, in which a complex is typically modeled as a densely-connected protein sub-network. recently, we showed that the quality of these identified protein complexes could be estimated by computing their signal-to-noise ratio , a standard measure used in information theory and signal processing to assess data quality   <cit> . essentially, snr evaluates the density of complexes found in the protein interaction network against a randomized version of the same network.

as the snr is independent of the number of complexes reported, its value can be directly compared across the different probability schemes. for discovery of protein complexes, we applied a previously-published algorithm  <cit>  which includes interaction probabilities in the complex identification process. snr was then computed on the set of complexes identified by each probability scheme. results are shown in table 4; out of all of the schemes, deng had the highest snr of protein complex detection.

conservation rate coherency
interacting proteins have been shown to evolve at similar rates, probably due to selection pressure to maintain the interaction over time  <cit> . for every pair of interacting proteins, pi and pj, let ""ri"" and ""rj"" be their respective rates of evolution. we then computed a ""conservation rate coherency score""  as the negative absolute value of the difference between the evolutionary rates of the two corresponding genes: crij = -| ri - rj |. the negative absolute value was used to ensure that higher values represent higher performance, consistent with other metrics.

evolutionary rates were obtained from fraser et al.  <cit>  and estimated using nucleotide substitution frequencies. we calculated the spearman correlation between the values of cr for the interacting proteins and their corresponding probability assignments in the different schemes . for all probability assignment schemes we obtained a statistically significant correlation  between the conservation rate coherency scores and the corresponding probabilities, indicating that proteins with high probability interactions tend to have similar conservation rates. the highest correlation was obtained for deng.

discussion
a brief review of the performance results suggests that the deng method  emerges as the clear winner, with top scores in three out of four non-circular quality metrics. comprising a 'second tier' are bader_high, bader_low  and sharan, which perform very similarly across most metrics with some differences in conservation coherency or gene expression . bader_low, which considers experiment type and interaction clustering as inputs, has a higher expression score than sharan, which considers experiment type only, implying that interaction clustering helps capture expression similarity. interestingly, bader_high, which incorporates more input attributes than bader_low or sharan, does not have substantially higher rankings. thus, in this case, adding more inputs to a probability assignment scheme does not appear to strongly enhance its quality.

as for the remaining schemes with lower overall performance , it is interesting to note that these were arguably the least and most sophisticated schemes, respectively. the deane method relied on only a single evidence type for assigning confidences, that of gene expression, whereas it appears that other factors may have been more informative . in contrast to deane, qi had the largest number of inputs for assigning confidences and, among these, included data on both co-expression and experiment type. however, it is well known that classifier accuracy can be degraded by including many irrelevant input variables  <cit> , and perhaps this is the reason for qi's lower performance. as an alternative explanation, in qi et al.'s evaluation of classification schemes, they concluded that their method was very successful in predicting co-complex membership, but performed poorly when considering physical interactions  <cit> . in our analysis, all interactions  were treated as pair-wise protein interactions, and this assumption may have contributed to the poor performance of qi et al. certainly, their classification method was among the most sophisticated of the schemes that we evaluated, and as such it is worthy of future exploration  regardless of its performance in the present study.

finally, equal almost always scored lowest, regardless of quality metric. thus, utilizing any probability scheme is better than considering all observed interactions to be true or equally probable.

beyond these broad rankings, is it possible to synthesize data from five largely independent metrics to arrive at an overall quantitative index of performance? as one approach, we normalized the scores for each metric as a fraction of the best score achieved within that metric over all confidence assignment schemes . table  <dig> summarises the fractional scores for the six probability schemes and five quality assessment measures. note that expressing scores as fractional values is an intermediate normalization which preserves the score distribution but compresses its range; although potentially more informative than the non-parametric analysis above based only on ranks, it must also be interpreted with more caution. however, in this case, the fractional scores reinforce the findings reported above based on rank.

CONCLUSIONS
we have compared and contrasted seven probability assignment schemes for yeast protein interactions. surprisingly, deng et al. performs significantly better than others while being one of the least sophisticated. it assigns discrete probability scores to large groups of interactions rather than to individuals, and it inputs just two lines of evidence, experiment type and expression similarity, rather than many. generalizing these observations, more complex approaches are so far unable to outperform simpler variants. thus, we arrive at a somewhat unexpected conclusion: at least in interaction confidence assignment, sometimes less means more.

","we also employ a new metric, the signal-to-noise ratio of protein complexes embedded in each network, to assess the power of the different methods.
seven confidence assignment schemes, including those of bader et al., deane et al., deng et al., sharan et al., and qi et al., are compared in this work.
importantly, we also find that utilizing any of the probability assignment schemes is always more beneficial than assuming all observed interactions to be true or equally likely.

","BACKGROUND
recent technological advances have enabled high-throughput measurements of protein-protein interactions in the cell, producing large protein interaction networks for various species at an ever-growing pace. however, common technologies like yeast two-hybrid may experience high rates of false positive detection. to combat false positive discoveries, a number of different methods have been recently developed that associate confidence scores with protein interactions. here, we perform a rigorous comparative analysis and performance assessment among these different methods.


RESULTS
we measure the extent to which each set of confidence scores correlates with similarity of the interacting proteins in terms of function, expression, pattern of sequence conservation, and homology to interacting proteins in other species. we also employ a new metric, the signal-to-noise ratio of protein complexes embedded in each network, to assess the power of the different methods. seven confidence assignment schemes, including those of bader et al., deane et al., deng et al., sharan et al., and qi et al., are compared in this work.


CONCLUSIONS
although the performance of each assignment scheme varies depending on the particular metric used for assessment, we observe that deng et al. yields the best performance overall . importantly, we also find that utilizing any of the probability assignment schemes is always more beneficial than assuming all observed interactions to be true or equally likely.

"BACKGROUND
the comparison of two protein structures is most efficiently handled as a hierarchical problem, more or less closely following the protocol laid out over a decade ago by singh and brutlag  <cit> .
its first step, fold recognition on the level of secondary structural element  correspondence, has been tackled repeatedly in the literature  <cit> , building on the founding body of work related to aligning protein structures at the atomic-resolution level  <cit> .
most of the latter adopted an iterative resolution approach by starting from variously defined fragments of protein structure  <cit> .
however, prominent methods capable of doing fast and conformationally tolerant search  <cit> , such as ssm  <cit>  and fatcat  <cit>  still take several tens of minutes of cpu time to perform a database search, doing a thorough but perhaps unnecessary job in order to eliminate bad candidates for a match.
the development of complementary, ultra-fast methods for rigid structural comparison of proteins seems to have migrated to the realm of computer science, and typically relies on index or hash based database retrieval  <cit> .
the algorithm from this family possibly the closest in spirit, if not in the scope, to the one we will propose below is tableausearch <cit> .
with its high level of abstraction of protein structure, it indeed proves capable of searching databases approaching  <dig> entries as a matter of minutes.
the method records and then discretizes the relative angle between any two pairs of sses in a structure, and stores it as a tableau  <cit>  to be used in the database search.
the entries, however, in tableausearch database are rigid domains, and the algorithm thus dispenses with conformationally flexible searches right at the outset.
looking for a substructural match in this approach is not a completely straightforward affair either  <cit> .
from mathematical biology side, several global descriptors of protein structure have been proposed  <cit>   with an eye on organizing our knowledge of protein  universe  <cit> .
an example is provided by sgm  <cit> , a method that relies on a set of measures from differential geometry to describe overall structure of a protein domain, and which we will use below as a representative of its class of methods.
even though the idea of a pre-filter based on gross features of the protein structure is implicit in several methods that have undergone a steady development  <cit> , it has seldom been discussed and documented as a computational problem on its own.
we propose, therefore, to take a look specifically at the question of the smallest possible set of features needed to describe protein structure, and propose its intuitively motivated reduced representation, equipped with a scoring function capable of detecting both rigid matches at domain level, and conformational changes involving relative motion of structural domains.
methods
in the current literature there exists a broad selection of methods for pairwise structural comparison of proteins  <cit> .
typically centered on backbone atom matching  <cit> , they take several seconds or even several minutes to compare two structures and decide that the match is not possible.
why is it, then, that a human observer can establish, after a single glance that two protein structures in cartoon representation are similar?
certainly we are not mentally matching the backbone atoms, nor the angles through which the secondary structural elements  are joined.
rather, the human observer will try to orient the two structures so that the sses point roughly in the same direction, and then perhaps check if the two diagrams are showing the same sequential ordering of the sses.
in search for an algorithm which will emulate this efficient process, we propose reducing the protein structure to the bare bones of structural information: sse direction and type  and sequential order.
furthermore, we define a function to score the match between two proteins in this representation; the best match between the two structures can then be found by looking for the rotation in the representation space which optimizes this function.
the resulting algorithm enables searching through a database of protein structures in a way which is fast, independent of the size of sses and enables detection of structures which are related, but correspond to two different conformations.
structure representation and match scoring function
to reduce the size of the representation of the protein structure, we replace sses by direction vectors in space, while keeping the information about the sse type , as indicated by the two different colors in the illustration in fig.
1a.
furthermore, we drop the information about the elements' relative placement in space, resulting in the representation shown schematically in fig.
1b.
this representation can then be written as an ordered set of three-dimensional unit vectors,
for a protein structure of nx sses.
the order of the elements is determined by the order in which sses appear on the peptide sequence.
each vector represents one of the two types of structural elements that appear in protein structures: α-helix or β-strand.
the information about the type is stored as a corresponding set of indicators
when this object is rotated, the rotation applies to each vector  equally: that is, the relative angles between the vectors stay the same.
in this representation, the closeness of vector  from the representation of one protein structure, x, and vector , from the representation of the other structure, y,
can be measured using the following matrix element, which falls off steeply as the angle between the two vectors increases:
here, δ is an adjustable parameter, and r is the rotation operator.
the overall quality of the match is given by
the negative sign here is arbitrary, indicating that f will be optimized through minimization with respect to rotation r. choosing a small δ enables performing the double sum, while effectively summing only over the nearest matching pairs.
in an ideal case of two exactly matching substructures, and δ tending to zero, the minimal value of f would be equal to the negative number of sses in the smaller structure.
the distribution of values of f in the rotation space will depend on the instance of the two sets, x and y, under consideration.
depending on the orientation of vectors in x and y, there may be a clear and isolated minimum in f, or there may be a region in r space densely populated with local minima of approximately equal depth.
in particular, when comparing two structures with many nearly-parallel elements, covering a small solid angle in our reduced representation, a whole range of rotations r may conceivably result in false 'matches.'
as an estimate of how easy it is to achieve a certain value of f, by a chance choice of rotation r, we evaluate the z-score:
that is, the distance of the value f from the average over all rotations r, measured in units of standard deviation .
the rotations resulting in near-zero  zf can then be dismissed as insignificant given the geometry of the problem.
the estimate of the z-score requires evaluation of the first two moments of f over the set of all possible rotations r, which can be done explicitly in the case of the average, and numerically in the case of the average square .
to make possible a search through a database of realistic protein structures, we need a relaxed expectation of what is the best attainable match in the direction of sses  <cit> , and therefore we need a finite sized d. this would lead to a number of false matches, were it not for the last requirement that we impose, which is that the sequential ordering of sses from the query is preserved in the set of their closest matching counterparts in the target.
that is, we want the outcome of the algorithm to be a map mr : i ↦m, where i is the index over  belonging to x, m is the index over  belonging to y, and for any two pairs ), ) it is true that
where ≺ indicates the precedence on the primary sequence of the protein.
to find a map which preserves the order, we reinterpret x and y as two alignable sequences of elements  labeled i and j. the letters here are sses, and their the similarity is given by dij.
d, eq.
<dig>  evaluated at ropt that optimizes f thus becomes a similarity matrix, playing the role that blosum matrices, for example, play in the more familiar context of the alignment of two primary protein sequences.
with the similarity matrix at hand, we can use a pairwise sequence alignment algorithm  <cit> , such as needleman-wunsch or smith-waterman.
the alignment procedure optimizes the sum of dij elements over the pairs ) matched in the pairwise matching algorithm
depending on the algorithm and parametrization, the alignment procedure may assign various gap penalties for the sses that do not map onto the other structure.
t  ignores such sses.
by retaining only the matched pairs which optimize t , we obtain a good orientation match between the pairs of sses, that at the same time complies with the sequential ordering in both structures.
a conformationally flexible match in this picture consists of two local minima in f for two different r's, thus incorporating a model in which structural domains maintain their internal structural organization during conformational changes in a protein.
in practice, it has to be verified that the two minima in r are different in a way that is statistically significant; the details may depend on the implementation.
eq.
<dig> is the place to extend the formalism, if so desired, to include other quantities that can be ascribed to a pair of sse, such as the length match between the two.
in the numerical experiments we performed , enforcing the length mismatch penalty of the form
the absolute value of the length difference, and tolΔl an adjustable parameter) may improve the performance.
the size of the improvement depends on the value used for δ and on the nature of the test the method is subjected to  .
implementation
to determine whether the reduced representation of the protein structure contains enough information for a reliable database search, we have implemented the above ideas in a preliminary way.
in this implementation we choose to optimize f starting from a set of initial guesses.
this set consists of rotations constructed by choosing all possible combinations of two vectors from x, and two vectors of the corresponding type and same sequential order in y ; the initial rotation, then, is the one which puts the first two vectors from each pair in the same direction, and overlaps the planes spanned by each pair .
this is followed by the steepest descent search for a minimum in the space of quaternions representing r  <cit> .
this loop is the central time consumer of the search.
the number of pairs that need to be checked out is
where si is the sse type indicator, as in the previous section, and  here is the kronecker δ, not to be confused with the gaussian width parameter used in the rest of the paper.
this leads to the worse case scenario  of complexity of , where nx and ny are the number of the sses in the two structures.
this number may be substantially smaller  in the case of mixed α/β structures.
it can also be alleviated by grouping the directions nearly parallel in space, in which case the complexity becomes  where nx and ny are the numbers of distinct sse directions in structures x and y.  in practice, the second and the fourth sum can be truncated at j = i + m and k = l + m, respectively, where m is a small number , without significant loss in performance.
this makes the complexity o, or o in the case of grouped directions.
in a pairwise comparison of two structures, the minima occurring at different r's are stored if the z score is deemed statistically significant; later they are sorted in the order of the ascending z-score, and the best one is reported.
a certain top number of suboptimal minima from this sorted list is checked for the complementarity of the match, and the complementary pair assigning the highest total score is reported as a flexible match.
this part can be generalized to n, rather than only two complementary matches.
when doing a database scan, pairwise matches between the query and different target structures are scored and sorted using t for a rigid search, eq.
<dig>  while the hits for a flexible search are sorted according to a heuristic score given by
where z <dig> and z <dig> are the z-scores, eq.
<dig>  for f evaluated at two rotations, r <dig> and r <dig> which match two different structural domains, and t , given in eq.
<dig>  is the quantity optimized in the pairwise alignment.
the two maps corresponding to the two rotations result in two different matrices dij and dij; t is evaluated based on the larger of the two values of matrix elements  = max .
RESULTS
it is quite a strong claim that the three features we have selected  provide enough information to distinguish two protein structures .
while proving it may not be feasible, we may demonstrate that, statistically, it works quite reliably.
below we investigate the distinguishing and classifying power of the representation, and point out its two possible applications: annotation of novel structures and modeling of protein dynamics by homology.
parametrization, data sets, and related statistics can be found in additional file  <dig>
self-scoring in a large database of structures
as a necessary condition for the representation to be of practical value, it has to be unique, enabling the function f to find the query itself in a database of structures.
to test this property, we ran an all against all search on  <dig> structures from pdb <dig>  <cit>  with more than three sses, using δ =  <dig>  and δ =  <dig> .
for both choices of δ, the total aligned score, eq.
<dig>  is invariably highest for the self match.
it is instructive to notice, though, that for the smaller value of δ, the geometric criterion, quantified by zf, eq.
<dig>  is in itself sufficient to distinguish uniquely the protein structure .
however, as we allow for more fuzziness in the geometric match, by setting δ =  <dig> , this criterion becomes insufficient , and we have to resort to the preservation of sequential ordering to describe the structure uniquely.
this has direct implication on the following experiment, in which detecting structures which belong to the same fold but are not identical forces us to relax the demands on the exactness of the geometric match.
classification of structural domains
general performance characterization
to be of use, a method of the type we are presenting is expected to be able not only to find and rank highly all structures which are identical to the query, but also the structures which are, in some sense, similar to it.
using the test  proposed by kolodny et al.
<cit>  we performed an all-against-all comparison of over  <dig> structures from cath v. <dig>   <cit> , and measured the ability of the method to rank highly the pairs with the same class, architecture, and topology.
the outcome is shown in fig.
<dig>  in the form of receiver operating characteristic  curve.
the best methods climb steeply in the fraction of true positives for small values of false positives.
to place the performance of our approach in the context of the existing methods, we show the results for several high-resolution methods , and one low resolution  method on the same graph.
in all computational experiments in this paper the methods were considered in their pairwise mode - additional capabilities of the accompanying servers  were not the subject of investigation.
the method suggested here lies within the bounds of performance characteristics of methods with finer granularity , indicating that direction, type, and order of sses represent a sizeable portion of the signal that the detailed methods are picking.
consistent with the qualitative description underlying the cath classification, in this experiment we obtained better sensitivity/specificity tradeoff by relaxing the criterion for the directional match by setting δ =  <dig> .
together with the results for the exact match problem above, this suggests a possibility of simulated annealing approach with stepwise decreasing δ, to obtain a distribution of hits with varying strictness in structural similarity to the query.
the time taken for this computational experiment, of approximately  <dig> cpu minutes for δ =  <dig>   on a  <dig> ghz processor, compares favorably with some  <dig> to  <dig> cpu hours needed for the high resolution methods to complete the same task .
it should be kept in mind, of course, that the approach we have laid out functions only as a pre-filter and classifier, and does not produce the actual structural alignment on the atomic level.
rather, we argue, a small subset of the structural features is responsible for the classification we are trying to reproduce, and this can be used to economize with computational resources.
comparison with pre-filters used in other methods
among the existing tools for structure comparison, the most proficient ones do include some way of pre-filtering , discussed to a larger or smaller extent.
since most of such methods have been designed to pass the test like the domain classification discussed here, this is a reasonable place to point out the novel aspects of our reasoning, and their performance implications.
hence we conclude this section with a brief comparison with vast and ssm, both well established methods with their own servers  <cit> , and both using sses as the basic elements of protein structure.
ssm
in the course of development of ssm, the authors have devoted a whole publication  <cit>  to the discussion of its preliminary step.
in its pre-filtering stage, ssm constructs a graph for each structure.
the vertices of the graph carry the information about each sse , while the edges are associated with the attribute of each pair of vertices/sses they are connecting .
the algorithm then looks for a common subgraph using a set of heuristic rules, divided into  <dig> levels, to decide on the ""sameness"" between vertices and edges from the two graphs.
the necessity to introduce the cutoffs  enforces discretization of the scoring function, in contrast to the approach proposed in this work.
an attempt to run the cath experiment using the five discrete levels of similarity in ssm is shown in fig.
<dig>  dotted line in the inset.
despite the comparatively small area under the roc curve obtained this way, the information manipulated by ssm is actually quite seizable.
in an attempt to extract more resolution from the ssm pre-filtering, we took the outcome from all five levels simultaneously, and treated the optimization of the roc area as a machine learning problem .
the outcome is shown in fig.
<dig>  inset, blue line.
it approaches the roc achieved by the method we are proposing, but at the cost of introducing fifty parameters difficult to grasp intuitively.
vast
vast also relies on a graph matching tactics in its pre-filtering stage, but in a substantially different way .
in contrast to ssm, where one graph represents each structure, in vast graph is constructed for a map between two structures, as follows.
in vast, sse elements are represented by direction vectors that, aside from the information about the type, explicitly retain the information about the sse length .
a discrete set of rotations acting on one of the structures/representations is attempted, each rotation satisfying the following:  the rotation maps one of the vectors from the rotated structure exactly onto one of the vectors from the fixed structure , and  it brings another vector from the rotated structure into the plane defined by z and some vector from the fixed structure.
this contrasts with the continuous space of rotations our algorithm is exploring.
in both  and  the vectors mapped between the two structures have to be of the same type.
for each of the rotations from this set, a structure termed ""digraph"" is constructed: the vertices correspond to pairs of vectors, one from each structure, that fall within certain cutoffs regarding the angle between the two and the allowed distance between their endpoints.
digraph's edges exist if the two pairings involved respect the sequential ordering on the input structures, and if they carry the weight inversely proportional to the difference in the angles between two vectors corresponding to the same structure.
the cutoffs and the weight are parametrized and the parameters optimized for a typical search.
in our comparison runs we used the default set of parameters.
the digraph can be traversed quickly to find the best alignment for a given rotation, and consequently the best scoring alignment over all rotations chosen.
this algorithm is similar to certain extent to the one proposed in this work, in the limit of small gaussian width δ , and with the length penalty  included.
the digraph traversal is an alternative to the dynamic programming approach we are taking.
the crucial difference here, however, is that vast operates on the level of pairs of sses, somewhat analogous to the possibility of using f <dig> as a scoring function in our approach.
the requirements this imposes are stricter, explaining the somewhat higher sensitivity of vast in the low false positive region  the rotations, furthermore, that are tested are not optimized to match the rest of the structure  and thus are not readily applicable to further refinement of the matching transformation, an extension that our approach is in principle amenable to.
also, insisting on the length match , in order to get rid of false positive matches, is a strategy which might backfire in the attempts to extend the search to a more distant structural similarity.
as is, however, this method of pre-filtering is very fast , and slightly better in the small fp region than our best take on the cath test, .
nevertheless, our roc does show signs of greater robustness and higher resolution capability, as indicated by the larger area under the curve.
detecting a substructure in a set of larger structures
what is the resolution with which this approach can detect a smaller query structure within a larger target structure?
to obtain an estimate we took the test set from the previous experiment  and required for each domain to be matched to the target domain with the same cat number from cath classification, but this time with the target domain embedded in the original full-protein structure.
the results are shown in fig.
<dig>  again, we try to place the performance of this rough comparison method in the context of what is achievable by methods performing the full structural alignment.
in this we choose to stick with the methods that are fast enough to perform the test in a reasonably short time.
for their performance in comparison with slower full-alignment methods see fig.
<dig>
to indicate an impossibility first, methods which assign a set of global descriptors to the structure  cannot tackle this problem.
sgm is used as an example here: this is equally true for all methods relying on assigning a hash function to a predefined structural domain.
in the following, we choose not to reinterpret the methods used, and refer the reader to the original publications.
instead, we would like to highlight the specific algorithmic choices, which, we believe, give these methods advantage over other approaches, in particular the one proposed in this work.
notably here, mammoth  <cit>  and sabertooth  <cit>  were never designed with large database scanning primarily in mind , but rather with the goal of comparing a model structure to a template  or obtaining a precise structural alignment between two structures .
the basic unit of structure being compared in mammoth  <cit>  is a heptapeptide.
compared to our current implementation, which enforces an sse as an elementary unit, irrespective of its length , the heptapeptide approach enables better resolution in the high specificity region.
sabertooth  <cit>  uses the idea that the correct alignment may be, among other things, recognized by the similar environment  seen by the aligned structural motifs.
this approach also results in strong performance in the small fp regime, and something that our approach hardly generalizes to.
tmalign  <cit>  uses sse alignment, before trying sse mapping which would be a nonsense from the sequence point of view.
this is an opportunity our implementation misses .
otherwise, tmalign manipulates very similar input information to the approach proposed here, and is therefore encouraging to see it trace out a practically identical roc curve, both in this test , and in the test shown in fig.
<dig>
3dhit  <cit>  shows the most robust roc curve in this test.
it dissects the peptide into 13-residue fragments, which first conveys the same advantage over our approach as discussed for mammoth above.
the algorithm then chops up the fragment into clusters.
in mapping clusters the identity of amino acid  is enforced  <cit> , an algorithmic move that speeds up the search substantially, but we would like to stay away from as long as possible in development of our algorithm.
further on, however, the fact is exploited that for similar structures a transformation that matches two subsets will match larger regions of protein structure, the fact that our approach also builds on, and that can be used to increase resolution of the match toward a full backbone match.
ssm  <cit> , a veteran high resolution method, does the best in the small fp region, but at the cost of cpu time two orders of magnitude longer than required to do the rough comparison we are proposing here.
the high resolution is achieved by imposing a series of geometric requirements on matched pairs of sse from the two structures .
the overall message seems to be that judging by the speed of our prefiltering and quite competitive sensitivity/specificity tradeoff it achieves it provides a good base for protein comparison engine.
finding conformationally related structures
next, we need to establish that the representation allows detection of conformationally related structures.
as an easier sub-problem, we first consider the task of finding the same protein in two different conformations, thus taking the noise brought in by the evolutionary divergence out of the equation.
this is analogous to the first test  in that the primary sequences of the query and the target are the same, but this time their structures correspond to two different conformations.
the test set consists of  <dig> structures selected from the database created by the users of dyndom  <cit>  server.
a similar set of of pairs of conformations of the same chain could have, of course, been created from other sources, for example molmovdb  <cit> .
the results are shown in fig.
<dig>  together with the performance on the same test for one slow, high resolution  and one fast, low resolution method .
the reduced representation shows reasonably high resolution, even though for this particular problem there are better suited approaches.
ssm and sgm, for instance, both perform exceptionally well.
in particular, the total time requirement for sgm is several minutes to produce the results shown.
the harder problem in the same category is finding conformationally related pairs of protein structures, distantly related  in the primary sequence.
this problem is compounded by the problem of finding the test set itself .
to illustrate an application for a computational tool which can successfully handle such cases, we briefly comment on an example marked as a flexible match in an all-against-all experiment on pdb <dig>  fig.
<dig> shows a structural match between enolase and signal recognition  <dig> kda protein.
signal recognition protein bears in its c-terminal apparently so far undescribed similarity to pfam  <cit>  n-terminal enolase domain.
the smaller domain in this protein also bears some similarity to the c-terminal enolase domain, at least in its α-helical part.
the four domains, however, have been classified in cath as  <dig> .
<dig>  and  <dig> .
<dig>   and  <dig> .
<dig>  and  <dig> .
<dig>  .
taking into account no more than 8% in sequence identity in the aligned regions in both domains, it means that this example would be difficult to construct either by a search though homologous sequence space or by inspection of cath database.
the aligned core domain in c-terminal domains, however, shows striking structural similarity .
the larger and the smaller domain appear rearranged with respect to each other in the two structures, as can be seen by using a linear coordinate transformation that overlaps the larger domain .
one structure, this suggests, could then be used as a scaffolding to model conformational change of the other.
could this conformational change appear as part of physiological functioning of either of the two proteins?
is it at all physically possible to get from one conformation to another at room temperature?
finding examples with structural similarity in two structural domains, rearranged in space, may indicate a possibility of conformational change in one or both proteins.
the reasonableness of such conjecture is, of course, subject to further testing through targeted molecular dynamics, or some related approach.
the type of structural comparison we are advocating, however, should produce more examples for this type of study.
discussion
we have suggested in the methods section that after dispensing with translation and the length of the sses, the structure is effectively represented by a set of points on a unit sphere.
with these points we associated information about underlying sse type and sequential order.
by settling on the minimal representation of the protein structure, we set out to analyze its sufficiency for structure description and retrieval.
as noted in subsection ""self-scoring in a large database of structures"", fig.
<dig> and the related discussion, the directions themselves, except when taken very narrowly , may be matched by quite diverse protein structures.
to get rid of false positive matches that arise that way, we have suggested imposing the requirement that the matched sses follow the same sequential order in the two structures.
this, however is not the only possible way around the problem: as discussed in mizuguchi and go  <cit> , and later elaborated by krissinel and henrick  <cit>  in development of ssm , the directions of sses can be supplemented by various other pieces of information: the length of sses, the distance and torsion angle between all possible pairs of sses in a structure and/or the angles between their directions and the direction of the line passing through their geometric centers.
the advantage of using this type of information, rather than requiring the common sequential order of the sses, then is in the ability to look for pairs of proteins with different connectivity between sses, that still result in the overall comparable structures.
on the flip-side, the set of requirements might end up being too restrictive in the search of similar  structures, as we have illustrated in the inset of fig.
<dig>
contrary to the model of similarity adopted here, where similar structures are assumed to share to certain extent the underlying sse arrangement, it is conceivable that two proteins might share a common function as long as they offer a common geometry of the surface to their common  interacting partners  <cit> .
in that case one might be interested in a method for detection and retrieval of proteins sharing the same shape, irrespective of the underlying secondary structure.
it is a possibility not explored here.
methods for retrieval by global shape similarity have been discussed in literature  and extremely short retrieval times  reported  <cit> ).
some questions remain outside the scope of these methods, such as detection of a common substructure or structural motif.
sticking to a more conservative model of shared protein structure, the problem which ultimately needs to be resolved is the correspondence: which sses  on two structures correspond to one another.
function f enables us to initially sidestep this problem, in principle at least, because the fast fall-off of the closeness measure dij  makes possible the double sum over all elements without the danger of obtaining as the optimal a solution where no actual match exists, but the sum over many distant neighbors artificially increases the score.
by starting the protein structure comparison by minimization of f, we are effectively adopting, on the sse level, the match-first-align-later approach, popularized by gerstein and levitt  <cit>  .
ideally, the scoring function f would quantify, in a single expression, the geometric match under the constraint of sequential ordering of the pairs, a problem which we leave open.
on the high-resolution end of the spectrum of related ideas lies the urms-rms hybrid algorithm  <cit> .
there, a set of directions in space is also considered, however not along the sses, but along the lines connecting neighboring cα atoms within a heptapeptide.
being a high-resolution method, it comes with the computational burden comparable to the other backbone-matching approaches .
the match scoring function used in that work is different from the one suggested here, but it runs into a similar difficulty of estimating the statistical significance for a match of different structures.
a solution offered there is comparison with an empirically derived background distribution of match probabilities using existing, unrelated protein structures.
instead, we opted for a solution which separates the geometric match from the alignment.
the fuzziest point in the algorithm we have outlined, therefore, is that the averages in eq.
<dig> should properly be evaluated not over the set of all rotations r, but only over those rotations which allow, through the matrix dij, the alignment of subsequences of the two proteins of substantial length.
numerical evaluation of these proper averages would effectively grind the search to a halt, so in our prototype evaluation we keep the averages over all r as an approximation.
the approximation works well for the rigid search, where it is used to dispense with bad solutions, rather than score good ones.
in the case of the flexible search we resort to the total assigned score as a scoring function, coupled with the requirement that both maps have a high rotational z-score on their own.
in terms of the implementation, the room for improvement is certainly ample.
the relatively large number of false positives is attributable, at least in part, to parallel beta sheets and helix bundles, which can be amended by more careful grouping of the representation vectors.
also, in the implementation used here, each β strand is represented by a single vector  - a rather crude approximation for most β strands, which are often bent.
perhaps stating the obvious, the ultimate degree of success of an approach will depend on the choices made in the implementation, as much so as on the underlying idea.
in this work, the available implementations  decided the way in which the three features we selected to describe a protein were used.
even though a faster, or more robust, implementation could perhaps be achieved by a different choice of optimization or alignment algorithm, these are replaceable components, and the main points of improvement are in the representation itself, in the distance  function, and in its statistical evaluation.
CONCLUSIONS
in an attempt to build a pre-filtering tool for a search through a database of protein structures, we proposed  reducing the representation of protein structure to an ordered set of unit vectors carrying the information about the direction and the type of the secondary structure element they represent, eq.
<dig>   measuring the distance between two elements of the same type in terms of a quantity falling off exponentially with the increasing angle between the two, eq.
<dig>   measuring the distance between the two representations as sum over pairwise distances between their elements, eq.
<dig>  and  ordering the near matches by their total aligned score, eq.
<dig>
the representation is easily extendable to other descriptors of protein geometry by generalization of the type, currently restricted to α-helix or β-strand, and interesting statistics may result from allowing the gaussian width δ to be type dependent.
we have shown that an implementation which minimizes the distance defined in eq.
<dig> through a steepest descent calculation, and subsequently enforces the sequential order between the matched sses using standard sequence alignment approach, performs well in terms of the resolution in the structure space.
notable, also, is the speed that can be achieved in structure comparison without tying up the information in the form of a single index - it is precisely this feature which enables us to generalize the search to flexible and multidomain cases, and makes this idea uniquely versatile among structural comparison algorithms.
the main concern addressed in this work has been whether this minimalist description of protein structure contains enough information to uniquely describe protein structures, and structural classes.
the conclusion is that the information is certainly sufficient for a unique self match of each protein structure studied , and represents the large chunk of the signal detected by the high resolution methods.
.
when extended to detection of distant structural similarity, the approach starts to suffer from ""false positive"" matches , but it stays within the acceptable limits of accuracy set by high resolution methods, and its speed certainly allows for an improvement by extending the number of elements and types in the description.
the straightforward motivation for this description of protein structure makes clear what the pitfalls and directions of improvement are, but even the existing implementation indicates that the approach may prove valuable in making novel predictions, in terms of both rigid and flexible structural comparison.

",935,"BACKGROUND
the comparison of two protein structures is most efficiently handled as a hierarchical problem, more or less closely following the protocol laid out over a decade ago by singh and brutlag  <cit> .

its first step, fold recognition on the level of secondary structural element  correspondence, has been tackled repeatedly in the literature  <cit> , building on the founding body of work related to aligning protein structures at the atomic-resolution level  <cit> . most of the latter adopted an iterative resolution approach by starting from variously defined fragments of protein structure  <cit> . however, prominent methods capable of doing fast and conformationally tolerant search  <cit> , such as ssm  <cit>  and fatcat  <cit>  still take several tens of minutes of cpu time to perform a database search, doing a thorough but perhaps unnecessary job in order to eliminate bad candidates for a match. the development of complementary, ultra-fast methods for rigid structural comparison of proteins seems to have migrated to the realm of computer science, and typically relies on index or hash based database retrieval  <cit> . the algorithm from this family possibly the closest in spirit, if not in the scope, to the one we will propose below is tableausearch <cit> . with its high level of abstraction of protein structure, it indeed proves capable of searching databases approaching  <dig> entries as a matter of minutes. the method records and then discretizes the relative angle between any two pairs of sses in a structure, and stores it as a tableau  <cit>  to be used in the database search. the entries, however, in tableausearch database are rigid domains, and the algorithm thus dispenses with conformationally flexible searches right at the outset. looking for a substructural match in this approach is not a completely straightforward affair either  <cit> .

from mathematical biology side, several global descriptors of protein structure have been proposed  <cit>   with an eye on organizing our knowledge of protein  universe  <cit> . an example is provided by sgm  <cit> , a method that relies on a set of measures from differential geometry to describe overall structure of a protein domain, and which we will use below as a representative of its class of methods.

even though the idea of a pre-filter based on gross features of the protein structure is implicit in several methods that have undergone a steady development  <cit> , it has seldom been discussed and documented as a computational problem on its own. we propose, therefore, to take a look specifically at the question of the smallest possible set of features needed to describe protein structure, and propose its intuitively motivated reduced representation, equipped with a scoring function capable of detecting both rigid matches at domain level, and conformational changes involving relative motion of structural domains.

methods
in the current literature there exists a broad selection of methods for pairwise structural comparison of proteins  <cit> . typically centered on backbone atom matching  <cit> , they take several seconds or even several minutes to compare two structures and decide that the match is not possible. why is it, then, that a human observer can establish, after a single glance that two protein structures in cartoon representation are similar? certainly we are not mentally matching the backbone atoms, nor the angles through which the secondary structural elements  are joined. rather, the human observer will try to orient the two structures so that the sses point roughly in the same direction, and then perhaps check if the two diagrams are showing the same sequential ordering of the sses.

in search for an algorithm which will emulate this efficient process, we propose reducing the protein structure to the bare bones of structural information: sse direction and type  and sequential order. furthermore, we define a function to score the match between two proteins in this representation; the best match between the two structures can then be found by looking for the rotation in the representation space which optimizes this function. the resulting algorithm enables searching through a database of protein structures in a way which is fast, independent of the size of sses and enables detection of structures which are related, but correspond to two different conformations.

structure representation and match scoring function
to reduce the size of the representation of the protein structure, we replace sses by direction vectors in space, while keeping the information about the sse type , as indicated by the two different colors in the illustration in fig. 1a. furthermore, we drop the information about the elements' relative placement in space, resulting in the representation shown schematically in fig. 1b. this representation can then be written as an ordered set of three-dimensional unit vectors,   

for a protein structure of nx sses. the order of the elements is determined by the order in which sses appear on the peptide sequence. each vector represents one of the two types of structural elements that appear in protein structures: α-helix or β-strand. the information about the type is stored as a corresponding set of indicators  

when this object is rotated, the rotation applies to each vector  equally: that is, the relative angles between the vectors stay the same. in this representation, the closeness of vector  from the representation of one protein structure, x, and vector , from the representation of the other structure, y,  

can be measured using the following matrix element, which falls off steeply as the angle between the two vectors increases:   

here, δ is an adjustable parameter, and r is the rotation operator. the overall quality of the match is given by   

the negative sign here is arbitrary, indicating that f will be optimized through minimization with respect to rotation r. choosing a small δ enables performing the double sum, while effectively summing only over the nearest matching pairs. in an ideal case of two exactly matching substructures, and δ tending to zero, the minimal value of f would be equal to the negative number of sses in the smaller structure. the distribution of values of f in the rotation space will depend on the instance of the two sets, x and y, under consideration. depending on the orientation of vectors in x and y, there may be a clear and isolated minimum in f, or there may be a region in r space densely populated with local minima of approximately equal depth. in particular, when comparing two structures with many nearly-parallel elements, covering a small solid angle in our reduced representation, a whole range of rotations r may conceivably result in false 'matches.' as an estimate of how easy it is to achieve a certain value of f, by a chance choice of rotation r, we evaluate the z-score:   

that is, the distance of the value f from the average over all rotations r, measured in units of standard deviation . the rotations resulting in near-zero  zf can then be dismissed as insignificant given the geometry of the problem. the estimate of the z-score requires evaluation of the first two moments of f over the set of all possible rotations r, which can be done explicitly in the case of the average, and numerically in the case of the average square .

to make possible a search through a database of realistic protein structures, we need a relaxed expectation of what is the best attainable match in the direction of sses  <cit> , and therefore we need a finite sized d. this would lead to a number of false matches, were it not for the last requirement that we impose, which is that the sequential ordering of sses from the query is preserved in the set of their closest matching counterparts in the target. that is, we want the outcome of the algorithm to be a map mr : i ↦m, where i is the index over  belonging to x, m is the index over  belonging to y, and for any two pairs ), ) it is true that   

where ≺ indicates the precedence on the primary sequence of the protein.

to find a map which preserves the order, we reinterpret x and y as two alignable sequences of elements  labeled i and j. the letters here are sses, and their the similarity is given by dij. d, eq.  <dig>  evaluated at ropt that optimizes f thus becomes a similarity matrix, playing the role that blosum matrices, for example, play in the more familiar context of the alignment of two primary protein sequences. with the similarity matrix at hand, we can use a pairwise sequence alignment algorithm  <cit> , such as needleman-wunsch or smith-waterman. the alignment procedure optimizes the sum of dij elements over the pairs ) matched in the pairwise matching algorithm   

depending on the algorithm and parametrization, the alignment procedure may assign various gap penalties for the sses that do not map onto the other structure. t  ignores such sses. by retaining only the matched pairs which optimize t , we obtain a good orientation match between the pairs of sses, that at the same time complies with the sequential ordering in both structures.

a conformationally flexible match in this picture consists of two local minima in f for two different r's, thus incorporating a model in which structural domains maintain their internal structural organization during conformational changes in a protein. in practice, it has to be verified that the two minima in r are different in a way that is statistically significant; the details may depend on the implementation.

eq.  <dig> is the place to extend the formalism, if so desired, to include other quantities that can be ascribed to a pair of sse, such as the length match between the two. in the numerical experiments we performed , enforcing the length mismatch penalty of the form   

 the absolute value of the length difference, and tolΔl an adjustable parameter) may improve the performance. the size of the improvement depends on the value used for δ and on the nature of the test the method is subjected to  .

implementation
to determine whether the reduced representation of the protein structure contains enough information for a reliable database search, we have implemented the above ideas in a preliminary way. in this implementation we choose to optimize f starting from a set of initial guesses. this set consists of rotations constructed by choosing all possible combinations of two vectors from x, and two vectors of the corresponding type and same sequential order in y ; the initial rotation, then, is the one which puts the first two vectors from each pair in the same direction, and overlaps the planes spanned by each pair . this is followed by the steepest descent search for a minimum in the space of quaternions representing r  <cit> . this loop is the central time consumer of the search. the number of pairs that need to be checked out is  

where si is the sse type indicator, as in the previous section, and  here is the kronecker δ, not to be confused with the gaussian width parameter used in the rest of the paper. this leads to the worse case scenario  of complexity of , where nx and ny are the number of the sses in the two structures. this number may be substantially smaller  in the case of mixed α/β structures. it can also be alleviated by grouping the directions nearly parallel in space, in which case the complexity becomes  where nx and ny are the numbers of distinct sse directions in structures x and y.  in practice, the second and the fourth sum can be truncated at j = i + m and k = l + m, respectively, where m is a small number , without significant loss in performance. this makes the complexity o, or o in the case of grouped directions.

in a pairwise comparison of two structures, the minima occurring at different r's are stored if the z score is deemed statistically significant; later they are sorted in the order of the ascending z-score, and the best one is reported. a certain top number of suboptimal minima from this sorted list is checked for the complementarity of the match, and the complementary pair assigning the highest total score is reported as a flexible match. this part can be generalized to n, rather than only two complementary matches.

when doing a database scan, pairwise matches between the query and different target structures are scored and sorted using t for a rigid search, eq.  <dig>  while the hits for a flexible search are sorted according to a heuristic score given by   

where z <dig> and z <dig> are the z-scores, eq.  <dig>  for f evaluated at two rotations, r <dig> and r <dig> which match two different structural domains, and t , given in eq.  <dig>  is the quantity optimized in the pairwise alignment. the two maps corresponding to the two rotations result in two different matrices dij and dij; t is evaluated based on the larger of the two values of matrix elements  = max .

RESULTS
it is quite a strong claim that the three features we have selected  provide enough information to distinguish two protein structures . while proving it may not be feasible, we may demonstrate that, statistically, it works quite reliably. below we investigate the distinguishing and classifying power of the representation, and point out its two possible applications: annotation of novel structures and modeling of protein dynamics by homology. parametrization, data sets, and related statistics can be found in additional file  <dig> 

self-scoring in a large database of structures
as a necessary condition for the representation to be of practical value, it has to be unique, enabling the function f to find the query itself in a database of structures. to test this property, we ran an all against all search on  <dig> structures from pdb <dig>  <cit>  with more than three sses, using δ =  <dig>  and δ =  <dig> . for both choices of δ, the total aligned score, eq.  <dig>  is invariably highest for the self match. it is instructive to notice, though, that for the smaller value of δ, the geometric criterion, quantified by zf, eq.  <dig>  is in itself sufficient to distinguish uniquely the protein structure . however, as we allow for more fuzziness in the geometric match, by setting δ =  <dig> , this criterion becomes insufficient , and we have to resort to the preservation of sequential ordering to describe the structure uniquely. this has direct implication on the following experiment, in which detecting structures which belong to the same fold but are not identical forces us to relax the demands on the exactness of the geometric match.

classification of structural domains
general performance characterization
to be of use, a method of the type we are presenting is expected to be able not only to find and rank highly all structures which are identical to the query, but also the structures which are, in some sense, similar to it. using the test  proposed by kolodny et al.  <cit>  we performed an all-against-all comparison of over  <dig> structures from cath v. <dig>   <cit> , and measured the ability of the method to rank highly the pairs with the same class, architecture, and topology. the outcome is shown in fig.  <dig>  in the form of receiver operating characteristic  curve. the best methods climb steeply in the fraction of true positives for small values of false positives. to place the performance of our approach in the context of the existing methods, we show the results for several high-resolution methods , and one low resolution  method on the same graph. in all computational experiments in this paper the methods were considered in their pairwise mode - additional capabilities of the accompanying servers  were not the subject of investigation. the method suggested here lies within the bounds of performance characteristics of methods with finer granularity , indicating that direction, type, and order of sses represent a sizeable portion of the signal that the detailed methods are picking.

consistent with the qualitative description underlying the cath classification, in this experiment we obtained better sensitivity/specificity tradeoff by relaxing the criterion for the directional match by setting δ =  <dig> . together with the results for the exact match problem above, this suggests a possibility of simulated annealing approach with stepwise decreasing δ, to obtain a distribution of hits with varying strictness in structural similarity to the query. 

the time taken for this computational experiment, of approximately  <dig> cpu minutes for δ =  <dig>   on a  <dig> ghz processor, compares favorably with some  <dig> to  <dig> cpu hours needed for the high resolution methods to complete the same task . it should be kept in mind, of course, that the approach we have laid out functions only as a pre-filter and classifier, and does not produce the actual structural alignment on the atomic level. rather, we argue, a small subset of the structural features is responsible for the classification we are trying to reproduce, and this can be used to economize with computational resources.

comparison with pre-filters used in other methods
among the existing tools for structure comparison, the most proficient ones do include some way of pre-filtering , discussed to a larger or smaller extent. since most of such methods have been designed to pass the test like the domain classification discussed here, this is a reasonable place to point out the novel aspects of our reasoning, and their performance implications. hence we conclude this section with a brief comparison with vast and ssm, both well established methods with their own servers  <cit> , and both using sses as the basic elements of protein structure.

ssm
in the course of development of ssm, the authors have devoted a whole publication  <cit>  to the discussion of its preliminary step. in its pre-filtering stage, ssm constructs a graph for each structure. the vertices of the graph carry the information about each sse , while the edges are associated with the attribute of each pair of vertices/sses they are connecting . the algorithm then looks for a common subgraph using a set of heuristic rules, divided into  <dig> levels, to decide on the ""sameness"" between vertices and edges from the two graphs. the necessity to introduce the cutoffs  enforces discretization of the scoring function, in contrast to the approach proposed in this work. an attempt to run the cath experiment using the five discrete levels of similarity in ssm is shown in fig.  <dig>  dotted line in the inset.

despite the comparatively small area under the roc curve obtained this way, the information manipulated by ssm is actually quite seizable. in an attempt to extract more resolution from the ssm pre-filtering, we took the outcome from all five levels simultaneously, and treated the optimization of the roc area as a machine learning problem . the outcome is shown in fig.  <dig>  inset, blue line. it approaches the roc achieved by the method we are proposing, but at the cost of introducing fifty parameters difficult to grasp intuitively.

vast
vast also relies on a graph matching tactics in its pre-filtering stage, but in a substantially different way . in contrast to ssm, where one graph represents each structure, in vast graph is constructed for a map between two structures, as follows.

in vast, sse elements are represented by direction vectors that, aside from the information about the type, explicitly retain the information about the sse length . a discrete set of rotations acting on one of the structures/representations is attempted, each rotation satisfying the following:  the rotation maps one of the vectors from the rotated structure exactly onto one of the vectors from the fixed structure , and  it brings another vector from the rotated structure into the plane defined by z and some vector from the fixed structure. this contrasts with the continuous space of rotations our algorithm is exploring. in both  and  the vectors mapped between the two structures have to be of the same type.

for each of the rotations from this set, a structure termed ""digraph"" is constructed: the vertices correspond to pairs of vectors, one from each structure, that fall within certain cutoffs regarding the angle between the two and the allowed distance between their endpoints. digraph's edges exist if the two pairings involved respect the sequential ordering on the input structures, and if they carry the weight inversely proportional to the difference in the angles between two vectors corresponding to the same structure. the cutoffs and the weight are parametrized and the parameters optimized for a typical search. in our comparison runs we used the default set of parameters. the digraph can be traversed quickly to find the best alignment for a given rotation, and consequently the best scoring alignment over all rotations chosen.

this algorithm is similar to certain extent to the one proposed in this work, in the limit of small gaussian width δ , and with the length penalty  included. the digraph traversal is an alternative to the dynamic programming approach we are taking.

the crucial difference here, however, is that vast operates on the level of pairs of sses, somewhat analogous to the possibility of using f <dig> as a scoring function in our approach. the requirements this imposes are stricter, explaining the somewhat higher sensitivity of vast in the low false positive region  the rotations, furthermore, that are tested are not optimized to match the rest of the structure  and thus are not readily applicable to further refinement of the matching transformation, an extension that our approach is in principle amenable to. also, insisting on the length match , in order to get rid of false positive matches, is a strategy which might backfire in the attempts to extend the search to a more distant structural similarity.

as is, however, this method of pre-filtering is very fast , and slightly better in the small fp region than our best take on the cath test, . nevertheless, our roc does show signs of greater robustness and higher resolution capability, as indicated by the larger area under the curve.

detecting a substructure in a set of larger structures
what is the resolution with which this approach can detect a smaller query structure within a larger target structure? to obtain an estimate we took the test set from the previous experiment  and required for each domain to be matched to the target domain with the same cat number from cath classification, but this time with the target domain embedded in the original full-protein structure. the results are shown in fig.  <dig>  again, we try to place the performance of this rough comparison method in the context of what is achievable by methods performing the full structural alignment. in this we choose to stick with the methods that are fast enough to perform the test in a reasonably short time. for their performance in comparison with slower full-alignment methods see fig.  <dig> 

to indicate an impossibility first, methods which assign a set of global descriptors to the structure  cannot tackle this problem. sgm is used as an example here: this is equally true for all methods relying on assigning a hash function to a predefined structural domain.

in the following, we choose not to reinterpret the methods used, and refer the reader to the original publications. instead, we would like to highlight the specific algorithmic choices, which, we believe, give these methods advantage over other approaches, in particular the one proposed in this work. notably here, mammoth  <cit>  and sabertooth  <cit>  were never designed with large database scanning primarily in mind , but rather with the goal of comparing a model structure to a template  or obtaining a precise structural alignment between two structures .

the basic unit of structure being compared in mammoth  <cit>  is a heptapeptide. compared to our current implementation, which enforces an sse as an elementary unit, irrespective of its length , the heptapeptide approach enables better resolution in the high specificity region.

sabertooth  <cit>  uses the idea that the correct alignment may be, among other things, recognized by the similar environment  seen by the aligned structural motifs. this approach also results in strong performance in the small fp regime, and something that our approach hardly generalizes to.

tmalign  <cit>  uses sse alignment, before trying sse mapping which would be a nonsense from the sequence point of view. this is an opportunity our implementation misses . otherwise, tmalign manipulates very similar input information to the approach proposed here, and is therefore encouraging to see it trace out a practically identical roc curve, both in this test , and in the test shown in fig.  <dig> 

3dhit  <cit>  shows the most robust roc curve in this test. it dissects the peptide into 13-residue fragments, which first conveys the same advantage over our approach as discussed for mammoth above. the algorithm then chops up the fragment into clusters. in mapping clusters the identity of amino acid  is enforced  <cit> , an algorithmic move that speeds up the search substantially, but we would like to stay away from as long as possible in development of our algorithm. further on, however, the fact is exploited that for similar structures a transformation that matches two subsets will match larger regions of protein structure, the fact that our approach also builds on, and that can be used to increase resolution of the match toward a full backbone match.

ssm  <cit> , a veteran high resolution method, does the best in the small fp region, but at the cost of cpu time two orders of magnitude longer than required to do the rough comparison we are proposing here. the high resolution is achieved by imposing a series of geometric requirements on matched pairs of sse from the two structures .

the overall message seems to be that judging by the speed of our prefiltering and quite competitive sensitivity/specificity tradeoff it achieves it provides a good base for protein comparison engine.

finding conformationally related structures
next, we need to establish that the representation allows detection of conformationally related structures. as an easier sub-problem, we first consider the task of finding the same protein in two different conformations, thus taking the noise brought in by the evolutionary divergence out of the equation. this is analogous to the first test  in that the primary sequences of the query and the target are the same, but this time their structures correspond to two different conformations. the test set consists of  <dig> structures selected from the database created by the users of dyndom  <cit>  server. a similar set of of pairs of conformations of the same chain could have, of course, been created from other sources, for example molmovdb  <cit> . the results are shown in fig.  <dig>  together with the performance on the same test for one slow, high resolution  and one fast, low resolution method . the reduced representation shows reasonably high resolution, even though for this particular problem there are better suited approaches. ssm and sgm, for instance, both perform exceptionally well. in particular, the total time requirement for sgm is several minutes to produce the results shown.  the harder problem in the same category is finding conformationally related pairs of protein structures, distantly related  in the primary sequence. this problem is compounded by the problem of finding the test set itself . to illustrate an application for a computational tool which can successfully handle such cases, we briefly comment on an example marked as a flexible match in an all-against-all experiment on pdb <dig>  fig.  <dig> shows a structural match between enolase and signal recognition  <dig> kda protein. signal recognition protein bears in its c-terminal apparently so far undescribed similarity to pfam  <cit>  n-terminal enolase domain. the smaller domain in this protein also bears some similarity to the c-terminal enolase domain, at least in its α-helical part. the four domains, however, have been classified in cath as  <dig> . <dig>  and  <dig> . <dig>   and  <dig> . <dig>  and  <dig> . <dig>  . taking into account no more than 8% in sequence identity in the aligned regions in both domains, it means that this example would be difficult to construct either by a search though homologous sequence space or by inspection of cath database. the aligned core domain in c-terminal domains, however, shows striking structural similarity .

the larger and the smaller domain appear rearranged with respect to each other in the two structures, as can be seen by using a linear coordinate transformation that overlaps the larger domain . one structure, this suggests, could then be used as a scaffolding to model conformational change of the other. could this conformational change appear as part of physiological functioning of either of the two proteins? is it at all physically possible to get from one conformation to another at room temperature? finding examples with structural similarity in two structural domains, rearranged in space, may indicate a possibility of conformational change in one or both proteins. the reasonableness of such conjecture is, of course, subject to further testing through targeted molecular dynamics, or some related approach. the type of structural comparison we are advocating, however, should produce more examples for this type of study.

discussion
we have suggested in the methods section that after dispensing with translation and the length of the sses, the structure is effectively represented by a set of points on a unit sphere. with these points we associated information about underlying sse type and sequential order. by settling on the minimal representation of the protein structure, we set out to analyze its sufficiency for structure description and retrieval.

as noted in subsection ""self-scoring in a large database of structures"", fig.  <dig> and the related discussion, the directions themselves, except when taken very narrowly , may be matched by quite diverse protein structures. to get rid of false positive matches that arise that way, we have suggested imposing the requirement that the matched sses follow the same sequential order in the two structures. this, however is not the only possible way around the problem: as discussed in mizuguchi and go  <cit> , and later elaborated by krissinel and henrick  <cit>  in development of ssm , the directions of sses can be supplemented by various other pieces of information: the length of sses, the distance and torsion angle between all possible pairs of sses in a structure and/or the angles between their directions and the direction of the line passing through their geometric centers. the advantage of using this type of information, rather than requiring the common sequential order of the sses, then is in the ability to look for pairs of proteins with different connectivity between sses, that still result in the overall comparable structures. on the flip-side, the set of requirements might end up being too restrictive in the search of similar  structures, as we have illustrated in the inset of fig.  <dig> 

contrary to the model of similarity adopted here, where similar structures are assumed to share to certain extent the underlying sse arrangement, it is conceivable that two proteins might share a common function as long as they offer a common geometry of the surface to their common  interacting partners  <cit> . in that case one might be interested in a method for detection and retrieval of proteins sharing the same shape, irrespective of the underlying secondary structure. it is a possibility not explored here. methods for retrieval by global shape similarity have been discussed in literature  and extremely short retrieval times  reported  <cit> ). some questions remain outside the scope of these methods, such as detection of a common substructure or structural motif.

sticking to a more conservative model of shared protein structure, the problem which ultimately needs to be resolved is the correspondence: which sses  on two structures correspond to one another. function f enables us to initially sidestep this problem, in principle at least, because the fast fall-off of the closeness measure dij  makes possible the double sum over all elements without the danger of obtaining as the optimal a solution where no actual match exists, but the sum over many distant neighbors artificially increases the score. by starting the protein structure comparison by minimization of f, we are effectively adopting, on the sse level, the match-first-align-later approach, popularized by gerstein and levitt  <cit>  .

ideally, the scoring function f would quantify, in a single expression, the geometric match under the constraint of sequential ordering of the pairs, a problem which we leave open. on the high-resolution end of the spectrum of related ideas lies the urms-rms hybrid algorithm  <cit> . there, a set of directions in space is also considered, however not along the sses, but along the lines connecting neighboring cα atoms within a heptapeptide. being a high-resolution method, it comes with the computational burden comparable to the other backbone-matching approaches . the match scoring function used in that work is different from the one suggested here, but it runs into a similar difficulty of estimating the statistical significance for a match of different structures. a solution offered there is comparison with an empirically derived background distribution of match probabilities using existing, unrelated protein structures.

instead, we opted for a solution which separates the geometric match from the alignment. the fuzziest point in the algorithm we have outlined, therefore, is that the averages in eq.  <dig> should properly be evaluated not over the set of all rotations r, but only over those rotations which allow, through the matrix dij, the alignment of subsequences of the two proteins of substantial length. numerical evaluation of these proper averages would effectively grind the search to a halt, so in our prototype evaluation we keep the averages over all r as an approximation. the approximation works well for the rigid search, where it is used to dispense with bad solutions, rather than score good ones. in the case of the flexible search we resort to the total assigned score as a scoring function, coupled with the requirement that both maps have a high rotational z-score on their own.

in terms of the implementation, the room for improvement is certainly ample. the relatively large number of false positives is attributable, at least in part, to parallel beta sheets and helix bundles, which can be amended by more careful grouping of the representation vectors. also, in the implementation used here, each β strand is represented by a single vector  - a rather crude approximation for most β strands, which are often bent.

perhaps stating the obvious, the ultimate degree of success of an approach will depend on the choices made in the implementation, as much so as on the underlying idea. in this work, the available implementations  decided the way in which the three features we selected to describe a protein were used. even though a faster, or more robust, implementation could perhaps be achieved by a different choice of optimization or alignment algorithm, these are replaceable components, and the main points of improvement are in the representation itself, in the distance  function, and in its statistical evaluation.

CONCLUSIONS
in an attempt to build a pre-filtering tool for a search through a database of protein structures, we proposed  reducing the representation of protein structure to an ordered set of unit vectors carrying the information about the direction and the type of the secondary structure element they represent, eq.  <dig>   measuring the distance between two elements of the same type in terms of a quantity falling off exponentially with the increasing angle between the two, eq.  <dig>   measuring the distance between the two representations as sum over pairwise distances between their elements, eq.  <dig>  and  ordering the near matches by their total aligned score, eq.  <dig> 

the representation is easily extendable to other descriptors of protein geometry by generalization of the type, currently restricted to α-helix or β-strand, and interesting statistics may result from allowing the gaussian width δ to be type dependent.

we have shown that an implementation which minimizes the distance defined in eq.  <dig> through a steepest descent calculation, and subsequently enforces the sequential order between the matched sses using standard sequence alignment approach, performs well in terms of the resolution in the structure space. notable, also, is the speed that can be achieved in structure comparison without tying up the information in the form of a single index - it is precisely this feature which enables us to generalize the search to flexible and multidomain cases, and makes this idea uniquely versatile among structural comparison algorithms. the main concern addressed in this work has been whether this minimalist description of protein structure contains enough information to uniquely describe protein structures, and structural classes. the conclusion is that the information is certainly sufficient for a unique self match of each protein structure studied , and represents the large chunk of the signal detected by the high resolution methods.

. when extended to detection of distant structural similarity, the approach starts to suffer from ""false positive"" matches , but it stays within the acceptable limits of accuracy set by high resolution methods, and its speed certainly allows for an improvement by extending the number of elements and types in the description.

the straightforward motivation for this description of protein structure makes clear what the pitfalls and directions of improvement are, but even the existing implementation indicates that the approach may prove valuable in making novel predictions, in terms of both rigid and flexible structural comparison. the server to accompany this paper, as well as the code used in the analysis presented in the text is available a http://epsf.bmad.bii.a-star.edu.sg.

","BACKGROUND
computational comparison of two protein structures is the starting point of many methods that build on existing knowledge, such as structure modeling , molecular replacement, or annotation by structural similarity. in a commonly used strategy, significant effort is invested in matching two sets of atoms. in a complementary approach, a global descriptor is assigned to the overall structure, thus losing track of the substructures within.

"BACKGROUND
event-driven surveillance, or passive surveillance, refers to observer-initiated provision of animal health related data .
in france, the goal of the event-driven surveillance system for bovine brucellosis is to ensure the early detection of bovine brucellosis, a disease of which the country has been declared officially free since  <dig>  the system relies on the mandatory notification of each bovine abortion, defined by the french rural code as the expulsion of a foetus or a calf, stillborn or dying within 48 h of birth  <cit> .
according to national regulations, farmers must contact their authorised veterinarian for each bovine abortion.
this veterinarian, chosen by the farmer, is mandated by the veterinary services to carry out regulatory interventions such as notification of suspected clinical cases or collection of samples.
the veterinarian must then report the abortion, collect data , stage of pregnancy and date of abortion) and take a blood sample from the aborting female to test for brucella spp.
the event-driven surveillance system for bovine brucellosis is managed by local veterinary services, which are in charge of implementing surveillance on a département scale , following up on laboratory results, and paying for veterinarians’ visits and laboratory tests for brucellosis.
apart from these regulatory measures, the gds  in some départements have developed their own diagnostic protocol for enzootic abortive diseases .
these protocols aim to provide technical support to veterinarians for identifying the causes of abortions, considering the direct financial losses for farmers.
diagnostic tests based on these protocols are partly funded by the gds in some départements.
training courses and information for veterinarians on abortion diagnoses are supported by gtvs .
although there is a gds and a gtv in each département, due to historical considerations, the proportion of gds members is not far from 100 % whereas only about 43 % of veterinary practices who carry out regulatory interventions in cattle herds are gtv members.
however, despite national regulations and the importance for farmers themselves in preventing public and animal health risks related to brucellosis and other abortive diseases, the under-reporting of abortions is a major limitation to the brucellosis event-driven surveillance system  <cit> .
by using a qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews of farmers and their veterinarians, we highlighted factors influencing the decision-making process of farmers and veterinarians  <cit> .
this qualitative study relied on “purposive sampling”  <cit> , and participants were chosen in order to cover a variety of herd characteristics  and attitudes towards their duty to report abortions.
therefore, the influence of these specific factors could not be quantified in this study.
but this analysis showed that four main themes influence the decision-making process of farmers and veterinarians: 1) the perceived risk of brucellosis and other abortive diseases; 2) the definition of a suspected case of brucellosis and other abortive diseases adopted by actors in the field, which is less sensitive than the mandatory definition; 3) the cost-benefit analysis conducted by actors, taking into account regulatory and health aspects, economic and financial losses, technical and practical factors; 4) the level of cooperation between veterinary services, gdss, gtvs, authorised veterinarians and farmers in each département  <cit> .
based on this qualitative study, we assumed that the proportion of notifying farmers  was influenced by veterinarians and the different local institutional stakeholders.
some studies have quantified variability in the attitudes and perceptions of veterinarians towards specific diseases  <cit> , biosecurity measures  <cit>  or the control of enzootic diseases  <cit> .
in human health, several epidemiological studies have demonstrated considerable variations in the notification practices of general practitioners  <cit> , and these might exist in the animal health sector as well.
to our knowledge, however, no studies have so far quantified the influence of veterinarians on the implementation of a mandatory surveillance system.
due to a lack of data, the overall involvement of local institutional stakeholders in the event-driven surveillance system for bovine brucellosis was studied by using the département as a proxy.
in this context, the objectives of the present study were 1) to quantify the respective influence of veterinarians and all local institutional stakeholders  on the proportion of notifying farmers and identify which actors have most influence on farmers’ decisions; 2) to analyse whether the influence of veterinarians is correlated with that of local institutional stakeholders.
material and method
data sources and study population
for every cattle farm, information about the location , animals , and animal movements  were extracted from the french national cattle register.
abortion notifications and data on veterinarians were extracted from the french national animal health information database .
due to administrative reasons , data on veterinarians refer to veterinary practices and not to individual veterinarians.
the study focused on abortions reported from  <dig> july  <dig> to  <dig> june  <dig>  it included all départements that had reported at least one abortion per year since  <dig>  and cattle herds where at least one calving was recorded and where the same veterinary practice carried out regulatory interventions over the study period.
a cattle herd was characterised by its département, size, production type, the veterinary practice mandated by veterinary services to carry out regulatory interventions in this herd over the study period, the number of abortions reported and the dates of veterinarian visits.
herd size was calculated as the mean number of females over 24 months of age per week.
five production types were defined according to the breed and number of calvings over the study period .
a veterinary practice was characterised by its national registration number, the size of its clientele and its gtv membership.
the clientele size was calculated as the mean number of females over 24 months of age per week recorded in farms where a veterinary practice carried out regulatory interventions.
a département was characterized by its proportion of gtv members .table  <dig> typology of the production type of cattle herds
in accordance with national regulations, personal data on farmers and veterinarians are collected through the bovine brucellosis surveillance system.
the data used in this study are not freely available because of legal restrictions.
their access was authorised by the french ministry of agriculture in the context of this study, provided the results remain anonymous.
modelling the proportion of notifying farmers
the proportion of notifying farmers was analysed with a logistic regression model that included covariates as follows: logitpijk=départementj+veterinariank+productiontypei+sizei+sizek+number_vetk+gtvk+prop _gtvj
pijk was the proportion of notifying farmers holding a cattle herd located in a département j with production type and size i, for which the veterinarian practice k carries out regulatory interventions.
the location of the herd  and the veterinary practice were included as crossed random effects  <cit> .
indeed, some veterinary practices carry out interventions in several départements and thus, their influence on the proportion of notifying farmers can interact across different départements.
the other covariates were: 1) with respect to farms, the production type “productiontypei”  and herd size “sizei” ; 2) with respect to veterinary practices, the clientele size “sizek” , the number of veterinarians working in the veterinary practice “number_vetk” , gtv membership of the practice “gtvk” ; 3) with respect to the département, the proportion of gtv members “prop_gtvj” .
we adopted a backward model selection process, which involves starting with all candidate covariates, testing the deletion of each covariate using the akaike information criterion   <cit> , deleting them if the model was improved by doing so, and repeating this process until no further improvement was possible.
two-factor interactions were tested, among farm-level covariates and veterinarian-level covariates, respectively.
we checked model fit by studying quantile-quantile plots of quantiles of residuals as proposed by  <cit> , assuming the fitted model is the true model versus the actual quantiles of residuals from the fitted model.
in order to quantify the respective influence of veterinarians and institutional stakeholders on the proportion of notifying farmers, variability in the proportion of notifying farmers among départements and among veterinary practices was studied based on the distribution of the random effects estimated for each département  and veterinary practice  respectively.
the odds ratio  of the effect of a département j or a veterinary practice k was calculated as exp or exp respectively.
in order to analyse whether the influence of veterinarians was correlated with the influence of institutional stakeholders, we calculated the correlation between the variability in the proportion of notifying farmers among veterinary practices in département j and the effect of this département j on the proportion of notifying farmers  using the pearson correlation test.
the underlying assumption was that a highly coordinated brucellosis event-driven surveillance system by local institutional stakeholders would be related to harmonised practices among farmers and veterinarians.
according to this hypothesis, the variability in the proportion of notifying farmers among veterinary practices would tend to decrease as the département proportion of notifying farmers increases.
for each département j, the variability in the proportion of notifying farmers among veterinary practices was computed as the component of two terms: 1) the inter-individual variation among veterinary practices, estimated as the variance of the distribution of the mean effect veterinariank estimated for veterinarian practices located in this département; 2) the intra-individual variation, estimated as the mean standard errors of veterinariank estimated for veterinarian practices located in this département  in r).
the statistical analyses were performed with r  <cit>  and the lme <dig>  <cit>  and arm  <cit>  packages.

discussion
by analysing the proportion of farmers who participated in the french event-driven surveillance system for bovine brucellosis in 2011/ <dig>  we intended to quantify the respective influence of veterinarians and all local institutional stakeholders  on the implementation of this surveillance system.
the proportion of notifying farmers was strongly influenced by farm factors , with an or up to  <dig> .
factors at the veterinary practice level had a significant but lower effect, with an or estimated at  <dig>  and  <dig>  for respectively the number of veterinarians and gtv membership, and 95 % of the or estimated for other unknown factors ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> .
lastly, factors at the département level had the lowest effect: their influence was taken into account by a single random effect, with 95 % of the estimated or varying between  <dig>  and  <dig> .
the variability in the proportion of notifying farmers among veterinary practices at a département scale was not correlated with the effect of the département.
limitations of the study
our analysis focused on abortion notification although the notification process involves abortion occurrence, abortion detection and abortion notification.
indeed, we assumed that veterinarians and local institutional stakeholders influence abortion notification in particular.
in order to quantify the overall influence of local institutional stakeholders on the proportion of notifying farmers, we used the département as a proxy.
we are aware that such an approach prevents us from differentiating the specific influence of local institutional stakeholders from other factors that actors in the field actors could share at the département level.
in particular, the history of brucellosis in a département might influence their perception of brucellosis risk, and thus their willingness to report abortions.
however, such an influence was not identified during our qualitative study  <cit> .
part of the variability among départements may also be due to farming practices, which differ between areas of production and might influence the ability of farmers to detect abortions.
but as the production type was included in the final model, we assumed these effects were low in comparison to the influence of local institutional stakeholders.
therefore, we assumed that the département effect could be interpreted as an effect mainly due to the different local institutional stakeholders.
due to a lack of available data, variations in the proportion of notifying farmers were studied in relation to the veterinary practice and not the individual veterinarian.
we are aware that studying the influence of each veterinarian would have revealed a greater variability in the proportion of notifying farmers among veterinarians.
however, variations in the proportion of notifying farmers among veterinarians are likely to be lower when they work together than when they belong to different veterinary practices, as they are more likely to share common practices in the former case .
in any case, this hypothesis should be properly addressed.
influence of specific factors related to the veterinarian and département
based on our study, the proportion of notifying farmers was higher among veterinary practices with more than one veterinarian than among veterinarians working alone.
veterinarians who work with other colleagues might be more inclined to report abortions than those who work alone: they can divide up tasks and thus have less need for giving priority to emergencies over regulatory interventions than veterinarians who work alone.
they can also motivate each other to report abortions and discuss matters with colleagues should they have technical difficulties in identifying abortion aetiology.
based on our study, veterinarians who are gtv members are more prone to report and/or to encourage farmers to report abortions than others.
those veterinarians are likely to be committed to developing technical expertise, and they find in this membership the way to maintain and develop this expertise .
as revealed by the previous qualitative study, some veterinarians report abortions because they have a technical interest in doing so  <cit> .
on the contrary, veterinarians who are not gtv members might lack the technical skills needed to identify the cause of abortion, which is considered difficult due to the wide range of potential pathogens, the ubiquity of pathogens such as q fever or salmonellosis  <cit> , and the lack of knowledge about differential diagnosis protocol  <cit> .
our study did not reveal any influence of clientele size and of the proportion of gtv members on a département scale on the proportion of notifying farmers.
cliente size was included as a proxy of the proportion of veterinarians’ activity dedicated to cattle herds , assuming that the higher this proportion was, the more prone veterinarians were to participate in bovine disease surveillance.
the proportion of gtv members on a département scale was assumed to reflect the involvement of local gtvs in coordination and technical support of veterinarians.
the absence of effect of these two covariates might be due to the fact that they did not correctly reflect the veterinarians’ activity and the activity of local gtvs, respectively.
moreover, the fact that most information and training courses are organised and carried out at nationally could explain the weak influence of local gtvs on veterinarians’ practices.
respective influence of farmers, veterinarians and local institutional stakeholders
based on the quantitative results of our study, the proportion of notifying farmers was influenced, in this order, by production type and herd size, veterinarians and, to a lesser extent, by local institutional stakeholders.
these results reflect the respective role of each actor on the abortion notification process.
farmers are key actors who detect and call for a veterinarian in the event of an abortion, and they are strongly influenced by mechanical and practical issues.
the number of abortions, and thus the probability for a farmer to report abortions, increases with herd size.
as underlined by the previous qualitative study, beef cattle farmers face difficulties in detecting aborting females and catching them when they are at pasture for a serological analysis  <cit> .
veterinarians are likely to have a greater influence on the decisions of farmers to call them for an abortion than institutional stakeholders, as they have frequent interactions with farmers.
when veterinarians are keen to report abortions, they can have a strong effect on farmers.
but their own decision to report abortions and to promote the importance of abortion notification among farmers depends on several individual factors, as highlighted by the previous qualitative study  <cit> .
beyond the role of veterinarians, our study underlined the role local institutional stakeholders could have on the involvement of veterinarians and farmers in the mandatory abortion surveillance system, even if this role was smaller than that of veterinarians.
indeed, the implementation of the event-driven surveillance system for brucellosis and an abortion diagnosis protocol might differ among institutional stakeholders.
coordination of veterinarians, including technical support and information on the results of the mandatory surveillance systems, depends greatly on local veterinary services.
likewise, the abortion diagnosis protocols provided by some gdss might encourage actors in the field to test aborting cows for diseases other than brucellosis and thus to report abortions.
in some départements, institutional stakeholders provide veterinarians with sampling material  and manage the shipment of samples to the laboratory.
but despite some efforts, local institutional stakeholders face difficulties in encouraging farmers and veterinarians to report abortions, which might explain their weak influence on the proportion of notifying farmers identified in our study.
besides, based on our results, the influence of veterinarians is not correlated with the influence of local institutional stakeholders.
veterinarians report or do not report abortions regardless of the level of surveillance system coordination by local institutional stakeholders: some are prone to report abortions in départements with a low proportion of notifying farmers whereas others are not, even if they are located in départements with a high proportion of notifying farmers.
prospects for improving the coordination of veterinarians and institutional stakeholders
based on the results of this study, there is a need for local institutional stakeholders to standardise the activity of veterinary practices in order to have a more effectively coordinated and consistent disease surveillance system.
veterinarians act as the interface between veterinary services, gdss, gtvs and farmers.
besides carrying out regulatory interventions, they play a major role in encouraging farmers to participate in these surveillance systems.
this role should be promoted locally by taking into account their difficulties and expectations.
nationally, a diagnosis protocol for abortive diseases was recently drawn up based on scientific requirements for sampling and laboratory analyses.
improving the coordination of veterinarians by institutional stakeholders providing technical support, training and information on the results of the abortion diagnosis protocol  is also expected to increase their participation in the surveillance system  <cit> .
these coordination actions should be standardised across départements by national institutional bodies.
CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the respective influence of veterinarians and local institutional stakeholders on the notification process of a mandatory disease.
in addition to carrying out regulatory interventions, veterinarians play a major role in encouraging farmers to participate in the surveillance systems.
however, improving their involvement is a challenge, considering their number, heterogeneous practices, knowledge and attitudes.
the results of this study, combined with a previous qualitative study  <cit> , shed light on the need to consolidate the involvement of veterinarians and local institutional stakeholders in the organisation of surveillance by national institutional bodies.
such initiatives would require special staff, but would also increase actors’ participation in the surveillance system.

in this context, the objectives of the present study were 1) to quantify the respective influence of veterinarians and all local institutional stakeholders  on the proportion of notifying farmers and identify which actors have most influence on farmers’ decisions; 2) to analyse whether the influence of veterinarians is correlated with that of local institutional stakeholders.

material and method
data sources and study population
for every cattle farm, information about the location , animals , and animal movements  were extracted from the french national cattle register. abortion notifications and data on veterinarians were extracted from the french national animal health information database . due to administrative reasons , data on veterinarians refer to veterinary practices and not to individual veterinarians.

the study focused on abortions reported from  <dig> july  <dig> to  <dig> june  <dig>  it included all départements that had reported at least one abortion per year since  <dig>  and cattle herds where at least one calving was recorded and where the same veterinary practice carried out regulatory interventions over the study period. a cattle herd was characterised by its département, size, production type, the veterinary practice mandated by veterinary services to carry out regulatory interventions in this herd over the study period, the number of abortions reported and the dates of veterinarian visits. herd size was calculated as the mean number of females over 24 months of age per week. five production types were defined according to the breed and number of calvings over the study period . a veterinary practice was characterised by its national registration number, the size of its clientele and its gtv membership. the clientele size was calculated as the mean number of females over 24 months of age per week recorded in farms where a veterinary practice carried out regulatory interventions. a département was characterized by its proportion of gtv members .table  <dig> typology of the production type of cattle herds



in accordance with national regulations, personal data on farmers and veterinarians are collected through the bovine brucellosis surveillance system. the data used in this study are not freely available because of legal restrictions. their access was authorised by the french ministry of agriculture in the context of this study, provided the results remain anonymous.

modelling the proportion of notifying farmers
the proportion of notifying farmers was analysed with a logistic regression model that included covariates as follows: logitpijk=départementj+veterinariank+productiontypei+sizei+sizek+number_vetk+gtvk+prop _gtvj 

pijk was the proportion of notifying farmers holding a cattle herd located in a département j with production type and size i, for which the veterinarian practice k carries out regulatory interventions. the location of the herd  and the veterinary practice were included as crossed random effects  <cit> . indeed, some veterinary practices carry out interventions in several départements and thus, their influence on the proportion of notifying farmers can interact across different départements.

the other covariates were: 1) with respect to farms, the production type “productiontypei”  and herd size “sizei” ; 2) with respect to veterinary practices, the clientele size “sizek” , the number of veterinarians working in the veterinary practice “number_vetk” , gtv membership of the practice “gtvk” ; 3) with respect to the département, the proportion of gtv members “prop_gtvj” .

we adopted a backward model selection process, which involves starting with all candidate covariates, testing the deletion of each covariate using the akaike information criterion   <cit> , deleting them if the model was improved by doing so, and repeating this process until no further improvement was possible. two-factor interactions were tested, among farm-level covariates and veterinarian-level covariates, respectively. we checked model fit by studying quantile-quantile plots of quantiles of residuals as proposed by  <cit> , assuming the fitted model is the true model versus the actual quantiles of residuals from the fitted model. in order to quantify the respective influence of veterinarians and institutional stakeholders on the proportion of notifying farmers, variability in the proportion of notifying farmers among départements and among veterinary practices was studied based on the distribution of the random effects estimated for each département  and veterinary practice  respectively. the odds ratio  of the effect of a département j or a veterinary practice k was calculated as exp or exp respectively.

in order to analyse whether the influence of veterinarians was correlated with the influence of institutional stakeholders, we calculated the correlation between the variability in the proportion of notifying farmers among veterinary practices in département j and the effect of this département j on the proportion of notifying farmers  using the pearson correlation test. the underlying assumption was that a highly coordinated brucellosis event-driven surveillance system by local institutional stakeholders would be related to harmonised practices among farmers and veterinarians. according to this hypothesis, the variability in the proportion of notifying farmers among veterinary practices would tend to decrease as the département proportion of notifying farmers increases. for each département j, the variability in the proportion of notifying farmers among veterinary practices was computed as the component of two terms: 1) the inter-individual variation among veterinary practices, estimated as the variance of the distribution of the mean effect veterinariank estimated for veterinarian practices located in this département; 2) the intra-individual variation, estimated as the mean standard errors of veterinariank estimated for veterinarian practices located in this département  in r). the statistical analyses were performed with r  <cit>  and the lme <dig>  <cit>  and arm  <cit>  packages.

discussion
by analysing the proportion of farmers who participated in the french event-driven surveillance system for bovine brucellosis in 2011/ <dig>  we intended to quantify the respective influence of veterinarians and all local institutional stakeholders  on the implementation of this surveillance system. the proportion of notifying farmers was strongly influenced by farm factors , with an or up to  <dig> . factors at the veterinary practice level had a significant but lower effect, with an or estimated at  <dig>  and  <dig>  for respectively the number of veterinarians and gtv membership, and 95 % of the or estimated for other unknown factors ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . lastly, factors at the département level had the lowest effect: their influence was taken into account by a single random effect, with 95 % of the estimated or varying between  <dig>  and  <dig> . the variability in the proportion of notifying farmers among veterinary practices at a département scale was not correlated with the effect of the département.

limitations of the study
our analysis focused on abortion notification although the notification process involves abortion occurrence, abortion detection and abortion notification. indeed, we assumed that veterinarians and local institutional stakeholders influence abortion notification in particular.

in order to quantify the overall influence of local institutional stakeholders on the proportion of notifying farmers, we used the département as a proxy. we are aware that such an approach prevents us from differentiating the specific influence of local institutional stakeholders from other factors that actors in the field actors could share at the département level. in particular, the history of brucellosis in a département might influence their perception of brucellosis risk, and thus their willingness to report abortions. however, such an influence was not identified during our qualitative study  <cit> . part of the variability among départements may also be due to farming practices, which differ between areas of production and might influence the ability of farmers to detect abortions. but as the production type was included in the final model, we assumed these effects were low in comparison to the influence of local institutional stakeholders. therefore, we assumed that the département effect could be interpreted as an effect mainly due to the different local institutional stakeholders.

due to a lack of available data, variations in the proportion of notifying farmers were studied in relation to the veterinary practice and not the individual veterinarian. we are aware that studying the influence of each veterinarian would have revealed a greater variability in the proportion of notifying farmers among veterinarians. however, variations in the proportion of notifying farmers among veterinarians are likely to be lower when they work together than when they belong to different veterinary practices, as they are more likely to share common practices in the former case . in any case, this hypothesis should be properly addressed.

influence of specific factors related to the veterinarian and département
based on our study, the proportion of notifying farmers was higher among veterinary practices with more than one veterinarian than among veterinarians working alone. veterinarians who work with other colleagues might be more inclined to report abortions than those who work alone: they can divide up tasks and thus have less need for giving priority to emergencies over regulatory interventions than veterinarians who work alone. they can also motivate each other to report abortions and discuss matters with colleagues should they have technical difficulties in identifying abortion aetiology.

based on our study, veterinarians who are gtv members are more prone to report and/or to encourage farmers to report abortions than others. those veterinarians are likely to be committed to developing technical expertise, and they find in this membership the way to maintain and develop this expertise . as revealed by the previous qualitative study, some veterinarians report abortions because they have a technical interest in doing so  <cit> . on the contrary, veterinarians who are not gtv members might lack the technical skills needed to identify the cause of abortion, which is considered difficult due to the wide range of potential pathogens, the ubiquity of pathogens such as q fever or salmonellosis  <cit> , and the lack of knowledge about differential diagnosis protocol  <cit> .

our study did not reveal any influence of clientele size and of the proportion of gtv members on a département scale on the proportion of notifying farmers. cliente size was included as a proxy of the proportion of veterinarians’ activity dedicated to cattle herds , assuming that the higher this proportion was, the more prone veterinarians were to participate in bovine disease surveillance. the proportion of gtv members on a département scale was assumed to reflect the involvement of local gtvs in coordination and technical support of veterinarians. the absence of effect of these two covariates might be due to the fact that they did not correctly reflect the veterinarians’ activity and the activity of local gtvs, respectively. moreover, the fact that most information and training courses are organised and carried out at nationally could explain the weak influence of local gtvs on veterinarians’ practices.

respective influence of farmers, veterinarians and local institutional stakeholders
based on the quantitative results of our study, the proportion of notifying farmers was influenced, in this order, by production type and herd size, veterinarians and, to a lesser extent, by local institutional stakeholders. these results reflect the respective role of each actor on the abortion notification process.

farmers are key actors who detect and call for a veterinarian in the event of an abortion, and they are strongly influenced by mechanical and practical issues. the number of abortions, and thus the probability for a farmer to report abortions, increases with herd size. as underlined by the previous qualitative study, beef cattle farmers face difficulties in detecting aborting females and catching them when they are at pasture for a serological analysis  <cit> .

veterinarians are likely to have a greater influence on the decisions of farmers to call them for an abortion than institutional stakeholders, as they have frequent interactions with farmers. when veterinarians are keen to report abortions, they can have a strong effect on farmers. but their own decision to report abortions and to promote the importance of abortion notification among farmers depends on several individual factors, as highlighted by the previous qualitative study  <cit> .

beyond the role of veterinarians, our study underlined the role local institutional stakeholders could have on the involvement of veterinarians and farmers in the mandatory abortion surveillance system, even if this role was smaller than that of veterinarians. indeed, the implementation of the event-driven surveillance system for brucellosis and an abortion diagnosis protocol might differ among institutional stakeholders. coordination of veterinarians, including technical support and information on the results of the mandatory surveillance systems, depends greatly on local veterinary services. likewise, the abortion diagnosis protocols provided by some gdss might encourage actors in the field to test aborting cows for diseases other than brucellosis and thus to report abortions. in some départements, institutional stakeholders provide veterinarians with sampling material  and manage the shipment of samples to the laboratory. but despite some efforts, local institutional stakeholders face difficulties in encouraging farmers and veterinarians to report abortions, which might explain their weak influence on the proportion of notifying farmers identified in our study.

besides, based on our results, the influence of veterinarians is not correlated with the influence of local institutional stakeholders. veterinarians report or do not report abortions regardless of the level of surveillance system coordination by local institutional stakeholders: some are prone to report abortions in départements with a low proportion of notifying farmers whereas others are not, even if they are located in départements with a high proportion of notifying farmers.

prospects for improving the coordination of veterinarians and institutional stakeholders
based on the results of this study, there is a need for local institutional stakeholders to standardise the activity of veterinary practices in order to have a more effectively coordinated and consistent disease surveillance system. veterinarians act as the interface between veterinary services, gdss, gtvs and farmers. besides carrying out regulatory interventions, they play a major role in encouraging farmers to participate in these surveillance systems. this role should be promoted locally by taking into account their difficulties and expectations. nationally, a diagnosis protocol for abortive diseases was recently drawn up based on scientific requirements for sampling and laboratory analyses. improving the coordination of veterinarians by institutional stakeholders providing technical support, training and information on the results of the abortion diagnosis protocol  is also expected to increase their participation in the surveillance system  <cit> . these coordination actions should be standardised across départements by national institutional bodies.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the respective influence of veterinarians and local institutional stakeholders on the notification process of a mandatory disease. in addition to carrying out regulatory interventions, veterinarians play a major role in encouraging farmers to participate in the surveillance systems. however, improving their involvement is a challenge, considering their number, heterogeneous practices, knowledge and attitudes. the results of this study, combined with a previous qualitative study  <cit> , shed light on the need to consolidate the involvement of veterinarians and local institutional stakeholders in the organisation of surveillance by national institutional bodies. such initiatives would require special staff, but would also increase actors’ participation in the surveillance system.

"BACKGROUND
wheat  is one the world’s major staple crops, supplying approximately twenty percent of the global total calorie intake .
there have been considerable advances in yield since the introduction of the ‘green revolution’ genes.
however for the uk, europe and other countries worldwide, the last decade has seen a decline in the rate of genetic gains, with yield plateaus in some environments .
furthermore, with the global demand for wheat rising faster than the rate of yield improvement, there is a genuine threat to food security.
therefore the discovery, understanding and eventual incorporation of genes and alleles that beneficially influence yield are major targets for breeding programs worldwide.
the grain yield of wheat and cereals in general, is a polygenic and highly complex trait that is influenced by environmental and genetic interactions at all stages of the plant’s growth .
to facilitate its study, yield is usually broken down into three main components; number of spikes per surface area, grain number per spike, and thousand grain weight .
these yield components are sequentially fixed during the growth cycle, vary in terms of their heritability, and are not always positively correlated with yield .
tgw is usually stably inherited  and can be further broken down into individual components including physical parameters  and grain filling characteristics, which are also under independent genetic control .
these include both the rate and duration of the grain filling process , the latter being normally phenotyped as green canopy duration after heading .
in the past decade, there have been significant advances in our understanding of the genetic control of grain size, shape, and grain filling parameters in the diploid crop species rice .
several genes with relatively large effects have been identified through map-based cloning and support the independent genetic control of grain length, width and grain filling parameters.
this differs from our limited understanding in polyploid wheat where several studies have identified quantitative trait loci  for grain size and shape , but no gene has yet been cloned.
moreover, many of these qtl are in relatively wide genomic regions and have not been validated and fine-mapped using independent germplasm, therefore having limited impact in breeding.
in rice, osgw <dig> encodes a previously unknown ring-type e <dig> ubiquitin ligase and functions as a negative regulator of grain width and weight .
recently, several studies have examined the role of the wheat homologue  on grain size parameters, although contradictory results have been reported.
two studies have described a snp at position − <dig> upstream of the putative start codon as significantly associated with wider grains and increased tgw in chinese germplasm .
however, the results are directly contradictory since each study found the positive association with the opposite snp at the exact − <dig> position.
despite the alternative alleles at this site, both studies identify a negative association between tagw <dig> expression levels and grain width.
yang et al.
identified a tagw <dig> frame-shift mutation in a large-kernel variety, and associated this mutant allele with increased grain width and tgw in a large f2: <dig> population.
this mutant mimics the original rice osgw <dig> truncation allele , suggesting that tagw <dig> and osgw <dig> share a conserved mechanism .
however, down-regulation of tagw <dig> through rna interference  resulted in decreased grain size and tgw in wheat , suggesting that tagw <dig> is a positive regulator of grain size with a divergent function to that of rice osgw <dig>  taken together, it is difficult to conclude the exact effect of tagw <dig> on grain size and tgw in wheat due to the discrepant studies published to date.
the objective of this study was to evaluate a doubled haploid mapping population across north european environments for thousand grain weight, yield and additional morphological and developmental traits.
we identified a meta-qtl for tgw, yield, and green canopy duration on wheat chromosome 6a.
we developed near isogenic lines  to validate the 6a qtl effects across environments, and morphometric grain analyses were conducted to determine the specific grain size components being affected by the qtl.
RESULTS
genetic map and qtl analyses
the spark x rialto dh linkage map was developed using  <dig> markers, including  <dig> ssrs,  <dig> dart,  <dig> protein markers, the rht-d1b perfect marker, and a morphological ga test.
the total length of the map was  <dig>  cm across  <dig> linkage groups which were assigned to specific chromosomes using published consensus maps .
seven chromosomes included at least two linkage groups  which were considered separately for the qtl analyses.
across locations, rialto had significantly  larger thousand grain weight  than spark  and this was consistent across years .
in the dh population, five qtl for grain size were consistently identified across at least five locations on chromosomes 1b, 2a, 2d, 4d and 6a .
the rialto allele conferred the increased grain size for four qtl , whereas spark provided the increased grain size on chromosome 4d.
two qtl for yield were identified across environments on chromosomes 4d and 6a, and both co-localized with the previously identified thousand grain weight qtl .
the 4d yield and tgw qtl peaks coincide with the rht-d <dig> dwarfing gene whose pleiotropic effect on yield and yield components has been comprehensively documented .
the yield and tgw qtl on chromosome 6a were detected between markers xgdm <dig> and xgwm <dig> with rialto providing the increasing allele for both traits.
this chromosome region was the only one apart from rht-d <dig> that significantly influenced both yield and grain weight in the spark × rialto dh population.
therefore, the grain size and yield qtl on chromosome 6a were selected for further study and designated as qtgw-jic.6a and qyld-jic.6a, respectively.
a factorial anova was conducted including environment and all two-way interactions to assess individual qtl effects and epistatic interactions between rht-d <dig> and qtgw-jic.6a/qyld-jic.6a.
there was a significant effect of rht-d <dig> and the 6a qtl on tgw  and yield  and strong interactions between qtl and environment for both traits .
however, there was no significant genetic interaction between rht-d <dig> and qtgw-jic.6a/qyld-jic.6a .
dh lines homozygous for the 6a rialto region between xgdm <dig> and xgwm <dig> had a significant increase in yield of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % across environments compared to dh fixed for the spark allele .
these gains ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % .
increases in tgw were more variable, averaging  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and ranging from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  .
the mean yield and tgw for the selected dh lines at each environment were positively correlated , although this was not significant  due to differential effects across environments.
for example, dh lines fixed for the qyld-jic.6a rialto segment exhibited yield improvements of  <dig> % in scotland , however tgw was only increased by  <dig> % at this site , whereas in other environments  tgw and yield were significantly correlated .
these results suggest that tgw is an important yield component underlying the qyld-jic.6a effect, however, the relative contribution of increased tgw on yield varied across environments.
in addition to the tgw and yield effects, a qtl for green canopy duration after heading  was also identified between xgdm <dig> and xgwm <dig> and designated qgcd-jic.6a.
similar to qtgw-jic.6a and qyld-jic.6a, the rialto allele had the positive effect extending green canopy duration significantly by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days  compared to the spark allele, across all four environments analysed.
green canopy duration showed a significant  negative correlation with yield across the four locations , although the correlations were not significant in three of the four environments.
there was no significant correlation  between green canopy duration and tgw  across environments.
chromosome 6a had no effect on plant biomass, harvest index, seeds/spike, and seeds/spikelet across locations.
multi-trait multi-environment qtl analyses
the marker resolution across chromosome 6a was increased by the addition of  <dig> snp-based markers .
the improved 6a genetic map covers a genetic distance of 66 cm, ranging from xgwm <dig> at the distal end of the short arm, to xgwm <dig> which maps mid-way along the long arm .
using the improved genetic map for chromosome 6a, the original phenotypic data was reanalysed using multi-trait multi-environment  analysis for a more precise positioning of the qtl across all environments .
for yield, qyld-jic.6a was identified as significant across the interval from xgdm <dig>  to xgwm <dig> , with the peak at wpt- <dig>  .
significant markers within this region were identified in  <dig> of the  <dig> environments, all with rialto as the beneficial allele .
for qtgw-jic.6a the qtl encompasses the whole linkage group with all markers showing significance and with rialto providing the positive allele in all cases.
the qtl reaches its highest significance between wpt- <dig>  to xgwm <dig> , with the peak at be <dig> .
significant markers were observed in all environments apart from france and germany in  <dig> .
qgcd-jic.6a spans the region from be <dig>  to be <dig> , has its highest significance at xgwm <dig>  and was significant across all four environments .
the mtme analysis established that the yield, tgw and green canopy duration effects are all co-localised to a 8 cm region between wpt- <dig>  to xgwm <dig>  and that these effects are stable across different north european environments.
in addition to these major effects, a minor qtl for tiller number was identified at bq <dig>  in three of the five environments , mapping distal to the location of qyld-jic.6a, qtgw-jic.6a and qgcd-jic.6a.
in this case, however, spark provided the positive effect allele.
validation of qtgw-jic.6a and qyld-jic.6a using near isogenic lines
to independently validate these multiple effects, bc <dig> and bc <dig> nils segregating for the qtl segment  were developed.
nils were assessed for yield, tgw and grain size parameters in five environments, four in england  and one in germany  .
overall, the rialto 6a nil significantly increased yield , although there was a strong interaction with environment .
in four of the five experiments yield increases were observed from the rialto nils , with three of these effects being significant and one non-significant .
however, a significant decrease in plot yield was observed in  <dig> in england, where rialto nils had  <dig> % lower yield .
for tgw, a significant increase was observed in rialto nils across locations , although again there was a significant interaction with environment  .
similar to plot yield, rialto increased tgw in four environments  with three being significant and one borderline non-significant .
no effects on tgw were observed in  <dig>  the plot yield and tgw of the 6a nils was positively correlated  across environments.
similar to the dh population, no consistent differences were observed between nils for plant biomass, harvest index, spike length, spikelet number, spike yield, seeds/spike, and seeds/spikelet .

significant differences are represented by * , **  and *** ; non-significant effects are also indicated .
delta refers to the difference between the rialto and spark nil phenotypes as a percentage of the spark nil.
morphometric measurements of the grain were analysed to assess the source of the increases in tgw .
total grain area was significantly increased in four of the five environments in an equivalent degree to the tgw results.
this was expected based on the high positive correlation between these two measures .
the increased grain size and weight was due primarily to significantly wider grains in the rialto nils.
grains from rialto nils were on average  <dig> % wider than grains from spark nils  and this was highly significant in four of the five environments tested.
no significant effect in grain length was observed between nils across locations with the exception of  <dig> where rialto nils had significantly longer grains than spark nils .
the alignment of twenty grains of equivalent bc lines illustrates the difference in grain width between bc <dig> and bc <dig> nils and the variation in grain size across environments .
validation of developmental traits using nils
developmental characteristics including heading date, physiological maturity and the calculation of green canopy duration were assessed in the uk environment over four years using bc <dig>  and bc <dig>  nils.
despite extreme variation in growing conditions over this period, robust significant effects were observed for all three traits .
for heading date, nils containing the rialto introgression flowered earlier by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days .
rialto nils also were significantly later at reaching physiological maturity compared to spark nils in all four seasons by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days .
the combination of these two effects significantly lengthens the green canopy duration for the rialto nils by an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days across environments .
the non-significant interaction  between green canopy duration and environment highlights the consistent effect of the rialto allele across growing seasons, despite the large variation in average green canopy duration between years .
these results suggest that the original green canopy duration qtl qgcd-jic.6a is in fact a combination of two distinct effects, earlier flowering and delayed final maturity, which both co-localize to the 6a region and are stably expressed across environments.

sequence analysis of tagw2
in rice, the ring-type e <dig> ubiquitin ligase osgw <dig> has been shown to negatively affect grain width.
the wheat homologue tagw <dig> has been mapped to chromosome 6a  and was, therefore, considered as a potential candidate gene for qtgw-jic.6a .
rialto, which produced wider grains and increased tgw and yield was found to contain the g allele at the − <dig> promoter snp.
using this polymorphism, tagw <dig> was mapped on the spark x rialto dh population to chromosome 6a co-locating with markers bs <dig>  bs <dig> and ca <dig> at  <dig>  cm , within the 8 cm peak interval determined by mtme .
sequencing of tagw <dig> gdna revealed only the single snp at position − <dig> of the  <dig>  bp upstream of the start codon between spark and rialto.
no additional polymorphisms were detected in the a-genome coding sequence nor in the splice sites between spark and rialto.
likewise, no snps or alternative splicing variants were identified for the a-genome from spark and rialto cdna samples.
discussion
the interplay between tgw/yield/green canopy duration
qtl analysis of the spark x rialto dh population demonstrated the co-localisation of qtl determining green canopy duration, grain size  and grain yield within an 8 cm interval on chromosome 6a.
these effects were confirmed with the development and assessment of independent nils of the rialto region into the spark background.
it was established that the extension of the green canopy duration qgcd-jic.6a was comprised of two independent traits, both earlier flowering and a delay in the final senescence which resulted in a significant extension of the green canopy duration.
both component traits mapped to the rialto 6a introgression, but their genetic relationship  could not be established with the germplasm used in this study.
green canopy duration after heading is commonly, yet mistakenly, used interchangeably with extended grain filling duration.
this common generalisation leads many studies to conclude that extended green canopy duration leads to extended grain filling duration thereby resulting in larger grains and increased yield .
we have shown, however, that this is not a direct/causal relationship in all cases.
caution should be exercised when interpreting the outcome of delayed leaf and plant senescence, especially in the absence of direct measurements on grain moisture content and maturity.
for example, rnai lines for the gpc gene confer an extended green canopy duration of >25 days , yet this is not accompanied by an extension in grain filling duration per se .
the results of our current study also suggest that this mechanism is not the main driver behind the rialto 6a yield effect.
qgcd-jic.6a showed no correlation with yield or tgw in the dh population, and despite a significant difference in gcd between nils in  <dig>  no yield or grain size benefit was observed.
this suggests that qgcd-jic.6a is most likely an independent genetic locus within the introgressed region , and that extended gcd is not the major determinant behind the increase in productivity observed in the dh population and nils.
although the relative magnitude of effects between grain size and yield were not always consistent, a significant positive correlation was observed between the two traits across environments, suggesting that grain weight is most likely the principal yield component for qyld-jic.6a.
in four of the five nil validation experiments the rialto introgression gave significant improvements in yield  and tgw , with morphometric measurements showing that the increased grain weight was predominantly a result of wider grains.
the final weight of individual grains is the last of the yield components to be established once the number of spikes per surface area and the grain number per spike have already been fixed .
this close correlation between grain weight and yield provides what could be seen as a more precise route to increased yields, compared to manipulating other yield components, as it is stably inherited  and compensatory effects are limited.
given the current rate of genetic gain in hexaploid wheat breeding, the >5% yield effect is equivalent to ~10 years of breeding, without considering additional phenotypic variation which could be identified in homoeologous loci for the 6a qtl.
ultimately, fine mapping though recombinant inbred lines will assist in determining the precise location of the traits discussed here and determine if the yield effect is pleiotropic to grain weight .
compared to the large number of qtl studies for yield and other complex traits in wheat, there have been relatively few studies into individual grain morphometric components.
ramya et al.
identified several independent genetic loci for tgw and grain length and width in a large dh population, with four of these qtl suggested as pleiotropic for tgw and length/width parameters.
in the current study we did not assess the original dh population for grain morphometric parameters due to the laborious nature of this task when the original field trials were conducted .
however, with the development of high throughout phenotyping equipment, such as the marvin grain analyzer, we were able to assess the nils in greater detail and determine the most likely effect underlying the increase tgw.
these new phenotyping tools should greatly facilitate the genetic dissection of grain size parameters in wheat in the coming years.
absence of yield and tgw effect in 2012
in the  <dig> uk growing environment no effect was seen in tgw and a negative response to yield was observed in the rialto nils despite the otherwise consistent positive effects in the additional four environments.
a possible explanation for this inconsistent result is the presence of an undesirable minor qtl for tiller number within the rialto introgressed region that maps distal to the grain size and yield effects.
we detected a minor qtl in the dh lines using the mtme analysis in three of the five environments tested, although this effect was borderline significant .
similar effects of lower tiller number in rialto nils were observed in  <dig> and 2013; however, they only affected the expression of the 6a yield and tgw effects in  <dig>  this growing season was uncharacteristic in the uk due to extreme weather contrasts.
the winter of  <dig> and spring of  <dig> were relatively warm and dry compared to the uk historical averages, leading to high levels of tiller production; however this was followed by an exceptionally wet period from april through much of the summer.
specifically for the 6a nils, we observed a two-fold increase in tiller number compared to the averages of the  <dig> and  <dig> seasons.
it is plausible that the higher tiller number in  <dig> led to additional genetic x environment interactions and compensatory effects in the nils which affected the expression of the 6a tgw and yield qtl.
tagw <dig> as a potential candidate gene for qyld-jic.6a and qtgw-jic.6a
the mtme qtl analysis defined an 8 cm region between wpt- <dig>  and xgwm <dig>  in which both qyld-jic.6a and qtgw-jic.6a co-localised.
within this region we mapped tagw <dig>  the wheat homologue of osgw <dig>  loss of function of osgw <dig> in rice leads to increased cell numbers in the spikelet hull , resulting in wider grains and indirectly affecting grain filling rates .
the combined effects lead to a 50% higher tgw in nils with the loss of function osgw <dig> allele, and multiple other pleiotropic effects.
in first instance, the similarity of effects between qyld-jic.6a/qtgw-jic.6a and osgw <dig> on tgw and grain width, and their syntenic positions in wheat and rice, respectively, suggests that tagw <dig> is a compelling candidate gene for qyld-jic.6a/qtgw-jic.6a.
there are several results, however, which suggest a cautious approach is needed in evaluating the possible role of tagw <dig> as qyld-jic.6a/qtgw-jic.6a.
first, the effect of qtgw-jic.6a on tgw is relatively small compared to that seen in rice , with nils carrying the positive effect qtl interval showing between  <dig> and 9% higher tgw.
this could be in part due to the polyploid nature of hexaploid wheat, with the additional homoeologues resulting in a dosage effect causing the phenotype variation to be more subtle.
second, the direct effect of osgw <dig> is on palea and lemma cell number which would be less relevant in the case of wheat due to the small role that these structures play on grain width and size.
third, the allelic variation at the sequence level between the spark and rialto parents is limited to a sole snp in the promoter region which has been loosely associated with tgw and width although with contradictory results .
perhaps the best evidence that tagw <dig> does indeed affect tgw and grain width in polyploid wheat comes from yang et al.
and bednarek et al.
who show the effect through a frame-shift mutation and rnai, respectively.
however, their results point to opposite effects for tagw <dig>  it is too early to conclude if and how tagw <dig> affects grain width and tgw in the spark x rialto population, but several additional experiments including detailed expression analysis and the fine mapping of qyld-jic.6a/qtgw-jic.6a with respect to tagw <dig> will help elucidate this relationship.
genetic architecture of quantitative traits in wheat
in rice, the grain size qtls identified from bi-parental mapping populations have relatively large effects on tgw and yield, whereas in wheat the majority of studies have identified qtl with relatively small additive effects on grain size .
these differences could be due to several reasons.
first, the biological mechanisms determining grain size and yield might be different across species.
for example, several rice qtl affect grain size indirectly through the modulation of spikelet hull and glume size .
these indirect effects might be species-specific since in wheat, the palea and lemma  are not so firmly attached to the grain and most likely do not determine its growth in the same manner as in rice.
second, the polyploid nature of wheat means that in many cases, mutations in individual homoeologues can be masked by functional complementation with homoeologous genes present in the other genomes.
this redundancy suggests that for many genes in wheat, their full effect will only be quantifiable when all two/three homoeologues are simultaneously mutated.
this problem is further confounded for quantitative traits where multiple genes contribute to a specific phenotype.
a cloned qtl for grain protein content in wheat  exemplifies the effect of polyploidy on the relative magnitude of a quantitative trait.
the original mapping of the qtl identified phenotypic variation in grain protein content between nils of approximately 10% .
the cloning of the gene, allowed simultaneous down-regulation of the different homoeologues using rnai, and revealed a much larger effect in grain protein content  than that of the b-genome homoeologue alone .
recently, this dosage effect has been confirmed in homozygous ems-mutants of the a and d genome homoeologues.
individual gene knockouts of the gpc-a <dig> and gpc-d <dig> homoeologues had a relatively small effect on grain protein content , whereas the double mutant had a significantly larger reduction of 17% .
future directions
the validation of these qtl using nils provides a critical first step to further fine map both traits using a series of homozygous recombinant lines.
the recent advances in wheat and triticeae genomics provide a robust framework from which to identify additional markers and candidate genes to aid in this process.
these advances include the public release of the wheat chromosome arm survey sequence by the international wheat genome sequencing consortium , the development of high throughput snp assays , exome sequencing of tilling populations , and the ongoing progress on individual chromosome arm physical maps .
however, to fully exploit these genomic advances, a shift from a quantitative to a qualitative genetic locus will ultimately be required to isolate the gene underlying these grain size and yield effects.
CONCLUSIONS
in this study we identified major and stable qtl for yield, grain weight, and green canopy duration in polyploid wheat across north european environments.
these effects were validated using a series of nils which showed, on average, over 5% improvement in yield and tgw in four of the five environments tested.
our results suggest that the yield effect is driven primarily by increased grain weight due to wider grains.
the lack of correlation between prolonged green canopy duration and yield/tgw argue against a direct/causal relationship between these traits within the germplasm studied.
using a promoter polymorphism, we mapped the tagw <dig> candidate gene within the qtl interval, although it is still premature to assign a specific contribution of this gene to the qtl effect.
the validation of this qtl provides an important first step to advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms regulating the complex processes governing grain size and yield in polyploid wheat.
",908,"BACKGROUND
wheat  is one the world’s major staple crops, supplying approximately twenty percent of the global total calorie intake . there have been considerable advances in yield since the introduction of the ‘green revolution’ genes. however for the uk, europe and other countries worldwide, the last decade has seen a decline in the rate of genetic gains, with yield plateaus in some environments . furthermore, with the global demand for wheat rising faster than the rate of yield improvement, there is a genuine threat to food security. therefore the discovery, understanding and eventual incorporation of genes and alleles that beneficially influence yield are major targets for breeding programs worldwide.

the grain yield of wheat and cereals in general, is a polygenic and highly complex trait that is influenced by environmental and genetic interactions at all stages of the plant’s growth . to facilitate its study, yield is usually broken down into three main components; number of spikes per surface area, grain number per spike, and thousand grain weight . these yield components are sequentially fixed during the growth cycle, vary in terms of their heritability, and are not always positively correlated with yield . tgw is usually stably inherited  and can be further broken down into individual components including physical parameters  and grain filling characteristics, which are also under independent genetic control . these include both the rate and duration of the grain filling process , the latter being normally phenotyped as green canopy duration after heading .

in the past decade, there have been significant advances in our understanding of the genetic control of grain size, shape, and grain filling parameters in the diploid crop species rice . several genes with relatively large effects have been identified through map-based cloning and support the independent genetic control of grain length, width and grain filling parameters. this differs from our limited understanding in polyploid wheat where several studies have identified quantitative trait loci  for grain size and shape , but no gene has yet been cloned. moreover, many of these qtl are in relatively wide genomic regions and have not been validated and fine-mapped using independent germplasm, therefore having limited impact in breeding.

in rice, osgw <dig> encodes a previously unknown ring-type e <dig> ubiquitin ligase and functions as a negative regulator of grain width and weight . recently, several studies have examined the role of the wheat homologue  on grain size parameters, although contradictory results have been reported. two studies have described a snp at position − <dig> upstream of the putative start codon as significantly associated with wider grains and increased tgw in chinese germplasm . however, the results are directly contradictory since each study found the positive association with the opposite snp at the exact − <dig> position. despite the alternative alleles at this site, both studies identify a negative association between tagw <dig> expression levels and grain width. yang et al.  identified a tagw <dig> frame-shift mutation in a large-kernel variety, and associated this mutant allele with increased grain width and tgw in a large f2: <dig> population. this mutant mimics the original rice osgw <dig> truncation allele , suggesting that tagw <dig> and osgw <dig> share a conserved mechanism . however, down-regulation of tagw <dig> through rna interference  resulted in decreased grain size and tgw in wheat , suggesting that tagw <dig> is a positive regulator of grain size with a divergent function to that of rice osgw <dig>  taken together, it is difficult to conclude the exact effect of tagw <dig> on grain size and tgw in wheat due to the discrepant studies published to date.

the objective of this study was to evaluate a doubled haploid mapping population across north european environments for thousand grain weight, yield and additional morphological and developmental traits. we identified a meta-qtl for tgw, yield, and green canopy duration on wheat chromosome 6a. we developed near isogenic lines  to validate the 6a qtl effects across environments, and morphometric grain analyses were conducted to determine the specific grain size components being affected by the qtl.

RESULTS
genetic map and qtl analyses
the spark x rialto dh linkage map was developed using  <dig> markers, including  <dig> ssrs,  <dig> dart,  <dig> protein markers, the rht-d1b perfect marker, and a morphological ga test. the total length of the map was  <dig>  cm across  <dig> linkage groups which were assigned to specific chromosomes using published consensus maps . seven chromosomes included at least two linkage groups  which were considered separately for the qtl analyses. across locations, rialto had significantly  larger thousand grain weight  than spark  and this was consistent across years . in the dh population, five qtl for grain size were consistently identified across at least five locations on chromosomes 1b, 2a, 2d, 4d and 6a . the rialto allele conferred the increased grain size for four qtl , whereas spark provided the increased grain size on chromosome 4d.

two qtl for yield were identified across environments on chromosomes 4d and 6a, and both co-localized with the previously identified thousand grain weight qtl . the 4d yield and tgw qtl peaks coincide with the rht-d <dig> dwarfing gene whose pleiotropic effect on yield and yield components has been comprehensively documented . the yield and tgw qtl on chromosome 6a were detected between markers xgdm <dig> and xgwm <dig> with rialto providing the increasing allele for both traits. this chromosome region was the only one apart from rht-d <dig> that significantly influenced both yield and grain weight in the spark × rialto dh population. therefore, the grain size and yield qtl on chromosome 6a were selected for further study and designated as qtgw-jic.6a and qyld-jic.6a, respectively.

a factorial anova was conducted including environment and all two-way interactions to assess individual qtl effects and epistatic interactions between rht-d <dig> and qtgw-jic.6a/qyld-jic.6a. there was a significant effect of rht-d <dig> and the 6a qtl on tgw  and yield  and strong interactions between qtl and environment for both traits . however, there was no significant genetic interaction between rht-d <dig> and qtgw-jic.6a/qyld-jic.6a .

dh lines homozygous for the 6a rialto region between xgdm <dig> and xgwm <dig> had a significant increase in yield of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % across environments compared to dh fixed for the spark allele . these gains ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % . increases in tgw were more variable, averaging  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and ranging from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  . the mean yield and tgw for the selected dh lines at each environment were positively correlated , although this was not significant  due to differential effects across environments. for example, dh lines fixed for the qyld-jic.6a rialto segment exhibited yield improvements of  <dig> % in scotland , however tgw was only increased by  <dig> % at this site , whereas in other environments  tgw and yield were significantly correlated . these results suggest that tgw is an important yield component underlying the qyld-jic.6a effect, however, the relative contribution of increased tgw on yield varied across environments.

in addition to the tgw and yield effects, a qtl for green canopy duration after heading  was also identified between xgdm <dig> and xgwm <dig> and designated qgcd-jic.6a. similar to qtgw-jic.6a and qyld-jic.6a, the rialto allele had the positive effect extending green canopy duration significantly by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days  compared to the spark allele, across all four environments analysed. green canopy duration showed a significant  negative correlation with yield across the four locations , although the correlations were not significant in three of the four environments. there was no significant correlation  between green canopy duration and tgw  across environments. chromosome 6a had no effect on plant biomass, harvest index, seeds/spike, and seeds/spikelet across locations.

multi-trait multi-environment qtl analyses
the marker resolution across chromosome 6a was increased by the addition of  <dig> snp-based markers . the improved 6a genetic map covers a genetic distance of 66 cm, ranging from xgwm <dig> at the distal end of the short arm, to xgwm <dig> which maps mid-way along the long arm .

using the improved genetic map for chromosome 6a, the original phenotypic data was reanalysed using multi-trait multi-environment  analysis for a more precise positioning of the qtl across all environments . for yield, qyld-jic.6a was identified as significant across the interval from xgdm <dig>  to xgwm <dig> , with the peak at wpt- <dig>  . significant markers within this region were identified in  <dig> of the  <dig> environments, all with rialto as the beneficial allele . for qtgw-jic.6a the qtl encompasses the whole linkage group with all markers showing significance and with rialto providing the positive allele in all cases. the qtl reaches its highest significance between wpt- <dig>  to xgwm <dig> , with the peak at be <dig> . significant markers were observed in all environments apart from france and germany in  <dig> . qgcd-jic.6a spans the region from be <dig>  to be <dig> , has its highest significance at xgwm <dig>  and was significant across all four environments . the mtme analysis established that the yield, tgw and green canopy duration effects are all co-localised to a 8 cm region between wpt- <dig>  to xgwm <dig>  and that these effects are stable across different north european environments. in addition to these major effects, a minor qtl for tiller number was identified at bq <dig>  in three of the five environments , mapping distal to the location of qyld-jic.6a, qtgw-jic.6a and qgcd-jic.6a. in this case, however, spark provided the positive effect allele.

validation of qtgw-jic.6a and qyld-jic.6a using near isogenic lines 
to independently validate these multiple effects, bc <dig> and bc <dig> nils segregating for the qtl segment  were developed. nils were assessed for yield, tgw and grain size parameters in five environments, four in england  and one in germany  . overall, the rialto 6a nil significantly increased yield , although there was a strong interaction with environment . in four of the five experiments yield increases were observed from the rialto nils , with three of these effects being significant and one non-significant . however, a significant decrease in plot yield was observed in  <dig> in england, where rialto nils had  <dig> % lower yield . for tgw, a significant increase was observed in rialto nils across locations , although again there was a significant interaction with environment  . similar to plot yield, rialto increased tgw in four environments  with three being significant and one borderline non-significant . no effects on tgw were observed in  <dig>  the plot yield and tgw of the 6a nils was positively correlated  across environments. similar to the dh population, no consistent differences were observed between nils for plant biomass, harvest index, spike length, spikelet number, spike yield, seeds/spike, and seeds/spikelet .

morphometric measurements of the grain were analysed to assess the source of the increases in tgw . total grain area was significantly increased in four of the five environments in an equivalent degree to the tgw results. this was expected based on the high positive correlation between these two measures . the increased grain size and weight was due primarily to significantly wider grains in the rialto nils. grains from rialto nils were on average  <dig> % wider than grains from spark nils  and this was highly significant in four of the five environments tested. no significant effect in grain length was observed between nils across locations with the exception of  <dig> where rialto nils had significantly longer grains than spark nils . the alignment of twenty grains of equivalent bc lines illustrates the difference in grain width between bc <dig> and bc <dig> nils and the variation in grain size across environments .

validation of developmental traits using nils
developmental characteristics including heading date, physiological maturity and the calculation of green canopy duration were assessed in the uk environment over four years using bc <dig>  and bc <dig>  nils. despite extreme variation in growing conditions over this period, robust significant effects were observed for all three traits . for heading date, nils containing the rialto introgression flowered earlier by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days . rialto nils also were significantly later at reaching physiological maturity compared to spark nils in all four seasons by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days . the combination of these two effects significantly lengthens the green canopy duration for the rialto nils by an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days across environments . the non-significant interaction  between green canopy duration and environment highlights the consistent effect of the rialto allele across growing seasons, despite the large variation in average green canopy duration between years . these results suggest that the original green canopy duration qtl qgcd-jic.6a is in fact a combination of two distinct effects, earlier flowering and delayed final maturity, which both co-localize to the 6a region and are stably expressed across environments.

in rice, the ring-type e <dig> ubiquitin ligase osgw <dig> has been shown to negatively affect grain width. the wheat homologue tagw <dig> has been mapped to chromosome 6a  and was, therefore, considered as a potential candidate gene for qtgw-jic.6a . rialto, which produced wider grains and increased tgw and yield was found to contain the g allele at the − <dig> promoter snp. using this polymorphism, tagw <dig> was mapped on the spark x rialto dh population to chromosome 6a co-locating with markers bs <dig>  bs <dig> and ca <dig> at  <dig>  cm , within the 8 cm peak interval determined by mtme . sequencing of tagw <dig> gdna revealed only the single snp at position − <dig> of the  <dig>  bp upstream of the start codon between spark and rialto. no additional polymorphisms were detected in the a-genome coding sequence nor in the splice sites between spark and rialto. likewise, no snps or alternative splicing variants were identified for the a-genome from spark and rialto cdna samples.

in the  <dig> uk growing environment no effect was seen in tgw and a negative response to yield was observed in the rialto nils despite the otherwise consistent positive effects in the additional four environments. a possible explanation for this inconsistent result is the presence of an undesirable minor qtl for tiller number within the rialto introgressed region that maps distal to the grain size and yield effects. we detected a minor qtl in the dh lines using the mtme analysis in three of the five environments tested, although this effect was borderline significant . similar effects of lower tiller number in rialto nils were observed in  <dig> and 2013; however, they only affected the expression of the 6a yield and tgw effects in  <dig>  this growing season was uncharacteristic in the uk due to extreme weather contrasts. the winter of  <dig> and spring of  <dig> were relatively warm and dry compared to the uk historical averages, leading to high levels of tiller production; however this was followed by an exceptionally wet period from april through much of the summer. specifically for the 6a nils, we observed a two-fold increase in tiller number compared to the averages of the  <dig> and  <dig> seasons. it is plausible that the higher tiller number in  <dig> led to additional genetic x environment interactions and compensatory effects in the nils which affected the expression of the 6a tgw and yield qtl.

tagw <dig> as a potential candidate gene for qyld-jic.6a and qtgw-jic.6a
the mtme qtl analysis defined an 8 cm region between wpt- <dig>  and xgwm <dig>  in which both qyld-jic.6a and qtgw-jic.6a co-localised. within this region we mapped tagw <dig>  the wheat homologue of osgw <dig>  loss of function of osgw <dig> in rice leads to increased cell numbers in the spikelet hull , resulting in wider grains and indirectly affecting grain filling rates . the combined effects lead to a 50% higher tgw in nils with the loss of function osgw <dig> allele, and multiple other pleiotropic effects. in first instance, the similarity of effects between qyld-jic.6a/qtgw-jic.6a and osgw <dig> on tgw and grain width, and their syntenic positions in wheat and rice, respectively, suggests that tagw <dig> is a compelling candidate gene for qyld-jic.6a/qtgw-jic.6a.

there are several results, however, which suggest a cautious approach is needed in evaluating the possible role of tagw <dig> as qyld-jic.6a/qtgw-jic.6a. first, the effect of qtgw-jic.6a on tgw is relatively small compared to that seen in rice , with nils carrying the positive effect qtl interval showing between  <dig> and 9% higher tgw. this could be in part due to the polyploid nature of hexaploid wheat, with the additional homoeologues resulting in a dosage effect causing the phenotype variation to be more subtle. second, the direct effect of osgw <dig> is on palea and lemma cell number which would be less relevant in the case of wheat due to the small role that these structures play on grain width and size. third, the allelic variation at the sequence level between the spark and rialto parents is limited to a sole snp in the promoter region which has been loosely associated with tgw and width although with contradictory results . perhaps the best evidence that tagw <dig> does indeed affect tgw and grain width in polyploid wheat comes from yang et al.  and bednarek et al.  who show the effect through a frame-shift mutation and rnai, respectively. however, their results point to opposite effects for tagw <dig>  it is too early to conclude if and how tagw <dig> affects grain width and tgw in the spark x rialto population, but several additional experiments including detailed expression analysis and the fine mapping of qyld-jic.6a/qtgw-jic.6a with respect to tagw <dig> will help elucidate this relationship.

genetic architecture of quantitative traits in wheat
in rice, the grain size qtls identified from bi-parental mapping populations have relatively large effects on tgw and yield, whereas in wheat the majority of studies have identified qtl with relatively small additive effects on grain size . these differences could be due to several reasons. first, the biological mechanisms determining grain size and yield might be different across species. for example, several rice qtl affect grain size indirectly through the modulation of spikelet hull and glume size . these indirect effects might be species-specific since in wheat, the palea and lemma  are not so firmly attached to the grain and most likely do not determine its growth in the same manner as in rice. second, the polyploid nature of wheat means that in many cases, mutations in individual homoeologues can be masked by functional complementation with homoeologous genes present in the other genomes. this redundancy suggests that for many genes in wheat, their full effect will only be quantifiable when all two/three homoeologues are simultaneously mutated. this problem is further confounded for quantitative traits where multiple genes contribute to a specific phenotype.

a cloned qtl for grain protein content in wheat  exemplifies the effect of polyploidy on the relative magnitude of a quantitative trait. the original mapping of the qtl identified phenotypic variation in grain protein content between nils of approximately 10% . the cloning of the gene, allowed simultaneous down-regulation of the different homoeologues using rnai, and revealed a much larger effect in grain protein content  than that of the b-genome homoeologue alone . recently, this dosage effect has been confirmed in homozygous ems-mutants of the a and d genome homoeologues. individual gene knockouts of the gpc-a <dig> and gpc-d <dig> homoeologues had a relatively small effect on grain protein content , whereas the double mutant had a significantly larger reduction of 17% .

future directions
the validation of these qtl using nils provides a critical first step to further fine map both traits using a series of homozygous recombinant lines. the recent advances in wheat and triticeae genomics provide a robust framework from which to identify additional markers and candidate genes to aid in this process. these advances include the public release of the wheat chromosome arm survey sequence by the international wheat genome sequencing consortium , the development of high throughput snp assays , exome sequencing of tilling populations , and the ongoing progress on individual chromosome arm physical maps . however, to fully exploit these genomic advances, a shift from a quantitative to a qualitative genetic locus will ultimately be required to isolate the gene underlying these grain size and yield effects.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we identified major and stable qtl for yield, grain weight, and green canopy duration in polyploid wheat across north european environments. these effects were validated using a series of nils which showed, on average, over 5% improvement in yield and tgw in four of the five environments tested. our results suggest that the yield effect is driven primarily by increased grain weight due to wider grains. the lack of correlation between prolonged green canopy duration and yield/tgw argue against a direct/causal relationship between these traits within the germplasm studied. using a promoter polymorphism, we mapped the tagw <dig> candidate gene within the qtl interval, although it is still premature to assign a specific contribution of this gene to the qtl effect. the validation of this qtl provides an important first step to advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms regulating the complex processes governing grain size and yield in polyploid wheat.

","in this study we identified a major qtl for tgw, yield and green canopy duration on wheat chromosome 6a of the spark x rialto population, across  <dig> north european environments.

"BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is a human pathogen causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.
it is a transient member of the normal bacterial flora that colonizes the upper respiratory tract of the host being a major cause of various diseases such as otitis media, pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis.
despite the constant development of therapeutics, antimicrobial drugs and vaccines, pneumococcal infection still causes severe diseases in young children, elderly people and immunocompromised individuals  <cit> .
in adults, pneumococcal infection is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and otitis media and, since the introduction of vaccination against haemophilus influenzae  and neisseria meningitidis also the most frequent cause of meningitis.
current immunization strategies focus on the use of s. pneumoniae polysaccharides-based vaccines, employing the 23-valent vaccine, which protects humans from two years of age, and the 7-valent toxoid-conjugated vaccine, used in children less than two years old  <cit> .
however, the available vaccines have several limitations due to the low immunogenicity of capsular polysaccharides, the high serotype variability and the genomic plasticity of this bacterium.
therefore, in the last decade there has been a great effort in developing improved vaccines to prevent pneumococcal disease.
several surface-associated proteins, which are well conserved among the different strains of s. pneumoniae and thus represent candidates of choice for the development of novel vaccine formulations have been identified and characterized.
among this class of proteins the immunoglobulin a <dig>  protease is a promising candidate since  it plays a major role in pathogen's resistance to the host immune response  <cit> , and  it is present in all pneumococcal strains and serotypes  <cit> .
the importance of iga protease is underlined by the fact that this host-specific enzyme is conserved in other pathogens of comparable disease and colonising similar niches  <cit> .
the iga <dig> protease is one of the two to four large zinc metalloproteinase present in the pneumococcal genome  <cit> .
the pneumococcal protease is a polypeptide of about  <dig> amino acids associated to the bacterium via n-terminal anchoring  <cit> .
it is a proteolytic enzyme that specifically cleaves human iga <dig> antibodies in the hinge region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain  <cit> .
cross-inhibition experiments performed with sera from immunized rabbits have revealed considerable serological diversity of iga <dig> proteases from different s. pneumoniae strains  <cit> .
serological analysis indicated that the sequence repeats domain of s. sanguis iga <dig> protease was immunogenic in rabbits and in humans, although the antibodies recognizing this region did not inhibit enzyme activity  <cit> .
specific antibodies reacting with iga <dig> protease have been detected in sera from patients hospitalized for pneumococcal infection  <cit>  as well as in young children  <cit> , highlighting the immunogenity of pneumococcal iga <dig> protease in humans.
the aim of this work was to identify the immunodominant epitopes of pneumococcal iga <dig> protease involved in the human antibody response against bacterial infection.
RESULTS
in a recent study, we isolated several antigenic regions of s. pneumoniae proteins by challenging a pneumococcal genome display library with antibodies from one patient infected by the bacterium  <cit> .
in the present work a similar approach was employed by using ""ad-hoc"" patients' sera which displayed a low titer of antibodies against the pneumococcal antigens identified in the previous study .
accordingly, sera from two patients hospitalized for pneumococcal pneumonia were used for a novel screening of the pneumococcal library.
phage pools were analyzed after two round of affinity selection and  <dig> out of  <dig> screened phage clones  were isolated by immunoscreening.
among them,  <dig> clones  contained insert encoding fragments of pneumococcal iga <dig> protease and  <dig> clones  contained insert of other bacterial proteins.
at the end of the selection procedure,  <dig> distinct phage clones whose dna inserts matched the sequence of the pneumococcal iga gene product were identified: clone sp <dig>  with a dna insert encoding for a protein fragment of  <dig> amino acids; clone sp <dig> encoding for a polypeptide of  <dig> residues; clone sp <dig> encoding for a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids.
as shown in figure  <dig>  all the protein inserts of the selected phages contain a common region of  <dig> amino acids corresponding to residues 420– <dig> of pneumococcal iga <dig> protease .
to characterize the biochemical and immunological properties of the selected protein fragments independently from the phage display context, the dna inserts of phages sp <dig> and sp <dig> were subcloned into vector pgex-sn  <cit> .
this resulted in the expression of gst fusion proteins which were purified from e. coli cells under native conditions by 1-step affinity chromatography.
the recombinant proteins were efficiently expressed and purified in large amounts from the cytoplasm of bacterial cells, with the yields of purified gst-sp <dig> and gst-sp <dig> being  <dig> and  <dig> mg per liter of bacterial culture, respectively.
immunoreactivity of recombinant antigens with immunoglobulins g  of human sera was examined.
to this aim, an enzyme-linked immunoassay was employed .
the gst-sp <dig> and gst-sp <dig> fusion proteins were assayed with  <dig> sera collected from healthy adults.
as a control, the igg reactivity against wild-type gst protein was assessed for each serum.
the criterion used to assign a specific reactivity against single antigens was an odgst-antigen greater than twice the odgst.
both the sp <dig> and sp <dig> polypeptides specifically reacted with more than 80% of serum samples .
next, the presence of immunodominant epitopes within the selected antigen fragments was investigated.
to this purpose, the common region of sp <dig> and sp <dig> protein fragments, corresponding to amino acids 420– <dig> of pneumococcal iga <dig> protease was analyzed.
figure  <dig> shows the alignment of this polypeptide of strain d <dig> to iga proteases of other pneumococci and related species.
in strain d <dig> such the sequence contains three  <dig> amino acid repeats which are part of a region of the iga protease found to show high intraspecies conservation and a high degree of interspecies variability  <cit> .
pneumococcal iga proteases fall in this region into two clusters: iga <dig> proteases in genomes of strains of serotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 6b all have three repeats and a common downstream region while other strains share a common downstream region with s. mitis and have from two , to seven , eight  or even nine of these highly conserved  <dig> amino acid repeats.
the sequences of iga proteases of other oral streptococci such as s. sanguinis or s. oralis can not be aligned in this region since no significant homology was detected.
two gst fusion proteins, respectively carrying residues 420– <dig>  and 458– <dig>  of the iga <dig> protease from s. pneumoniae r <dig> strain were expressed.
as shown in figure  <dig>  the recombinant gst-epia and gst-epib antigens were efficiently purified under native conditions from transformed e. coli cells.
immunoreactivity of recombinant antigens with igg antibodies of human sera was examined and the results were compared to those obtained by use of the largest fragment of the iga <dig> protease .
the gst-epia, gst-epib and gst-sp <dig> antigens were assayed by rec-elisa with serum samples from the two patients hospitalized for pneumococcal pneumonia  and from  <dig> healthy individuals.
immunoreactivity of wild-type gst was also assessed for each serum.
as shown in table  <dig>  the recombinant gst-sp <dig>  gst-epia and gst-epib proteins specifically reacted with  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the sera, respectively, highlighting a broad antibody recognition of all antigen fragments.
pa pserum samples from patients with pneumococcal pneumonia  and from healthy adults  were analyzed by igg rec-elisa with individual recombinant proteins.
pb pthe cutoff values were determined for each serum as two times the od readings obtained with the gst.
boldface type, od values greater than the cutoff values.
because of the broad reactivity of the epia fragment, its recognition by antibodies present in sera from young children was also investigated.
serum samples from forty children with an age comprised between  <dig> and  <dig> years were assayed with the recombinant gst-epia antigen by rec-elisa.
as shown in fig.
<dig>  specific igg antibodies against the epia polypeptide were detected in sera from the majority of subjects , thus demonstrating that 68% of children less than  <dig> years old had specific antibodies against this short polypeptide.
next, a detailed epitope mapping was performed employing affinity-purified antibodies.
specific immunoglobulins against the gst-epia fusion protein were purified from  <dig> epia-reactive sera and then assayed with the recombinant gst-epia, gst-epib and gst-sp <dig> antigens by rec-elisa.
as a negative control, the igg reactivity against wild-type gst protein was also assessed.
as shown in table  <dig>  the affinity-purified anti-epia antibodies specifically recognized both the epia and epib polypeptides as well as the large sp <dig> fragment, indicating that a common epitope was present in the epia and epib protein sequences.
pa precombinant antigens were ppanalyzed by igg rec-elisa with a homogeneos mixture of human sera  or with affinity-purified anti-epia antibodies
pb pthe cutoff values for the igg rec-elisa with the recombinant gst-epia, gst-epib, and gst-sp <dig> proteins were calculated as two times the od readings obtained with the gst.
boldface type, od values greater than the cutoff values.
next, to exclude non-specific immunoreactivity due either to altered conformation of the small polypeptides with respect to native iga <dig> protease or to cross-reactivity of unrelated antibodies in human sera, a western blot analysis was performed.
to this aim, a whole cell lysate of s. pneumoniae was challenged with the affinity-purified anti-epia antibodies.
bacterial lysates from pneumococcal iga-deficient mutant strain fp <dig> and from streptococcus gordonii were assayed as controls.
as shown in figure  <dig>  a unique protein band with an apparent molecular mass higher than  <dig> kda specifically reacted with the anti-epia antibodies in an unencapsulated strain of pneumococcus .
in the fp <dig> mutant strain, in which the iga gene was deleted, as well as in s. gordonii, such a protein band was not visible, demonstrating that the anti-epia antibodies specifically recognized the pneumococcal enzyme.
finally, to investigate whether the epia polypeptide is exposed on the bacterium and is recognizable by anti-epia antibodies, a cell-elisa analysis was performed on whole s. pneumoniae cells.
the fp <dig> strain was used as the negative control.
the affinity-purified anti-epia antibodies reacted with intact bacterial cells  but not with the iga-deleted fp <dig> strain , indicating that the epia epitope within the tandem repeats of the pneumococcal enzyme is indeed exposed in the native state.
noteworthy, our results are in close agreement with a previous work where it was demonstrated that the tandem repeats of s. sanguis iga <dig> protease contain immunodominant epitopes exposed in the denatured and native state  <cit> .
discussion
bacterial iga <dig> proteases are highly specific endopeptidases that are secreted by a small number of bacteria associated with humans  <cit> .
iga <dig> protease-producing bacteria include the mucosal pathogens n. meningitidis, n. gonorrhoeae, h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae, u. urealyticum and some members of pharyngeal microfloras such as prevotella, gemella haemolysans, s. sanguis, s. oralis and s. mitis  <cit> .
the importance of this bacterial enzyme in the interaction with the host is evidenced by the fact that most of these enzymes are specific for human iga only, and that their impact on the host is so great as to become one of the few recognised factors of positive evolutionary selection on the human genome  <cit> .
for the bacterial pathogens colonizing mucosal surfaces, iga <dig> protease production represents a virulent factor and contributes to the pathogenesis of invasive infection by cleaving the fc receptor from secreted immunoglobulins a <dig>  thus preventing opsonophagocytosis  <cit> .
iga <dig> proteases have been shown to be targets of enzyme-neutralizing antibodies in serum and secretions  <cit> , which may be induced in a state of bacterial carriage as well as during invasive infection  <cit> .
we previously demonstrated the potential of phage-display technology in identifying b-cell epitopes recognized by the human immune response against toxoplasma gondii and s. pneumoniae infection  <cit> , even though such a technique usually favors the identification of linear epitopes whereas conformational epitopes are often overlooked.
nevertheless, the present work allowed the identification of antigenic regions of the pneumococcal iga <dig> protease that are broadly recognized by human antibodies.
challenging a lambda-display library of s. pneumoniae with sera from patients hospitalized for pneumococcal pneumonia enabled the selection of three distinct clones harboring a common region of the iga <dig> protease.
all clone sequences matched the pneumococcal enzyme encompassing amino acids 360– <dig>  the immunoreactivity of the selected fragments, expressed as gst fusion products, was assessed; overall, igg antibodies in serum samples from more than 90% of healthy adults reacted with at least one antigen fragment, which emphasizes the broad recognition of pneumococcal iga <dig> protease by the human b cell response.
because of the broad reactivity of the selected iga <dig> protease fragments, a detailed characterization of their common region, composed by  <dig> amino acids, was performed.
this lead to classify the sequence corresponding to residues 420– <dig>  of the iga gene product as the most reactive polypeptide, which was recognized by antibodies present in sera from 90% of healthy adults and 68% of children with an age comprised between  <dig> and  <dig> years, thus suggesting that the human antibody response against iga <dig> protease occurs during childhood.
noteworthy, our data are in agreement with a previous study showing that igg antibodies from the majority of children less than two years old specifically reacted with pneumococcal antigens, including the iga <dig> protease  <cit> .
the evidence that affinity-purified anti-epia antibodies also reacted with the epib fragment  indicated that a common epitope within polypeptides was recognized by human sera.
notably, a repeated 9-mer sequence vvtdkgepe is present twice in epia and once in epib fragments .
this duplication might account for the larger reactivity of the epia peptide with respect to the epib peptide.
the iga <dig> protease of s. pneumoniae is a major antigen expressed in all known pneumococcal strains  <cit> .
despite the pneumococcal enzyme has a peculiar structure among bacterial proteases, homology searches have indicated that the iga gene of s. pneumoniae is also found in other streptococci and related organisms  <cit> .
as already noted by others, the repeats region shows high conservation within the different pneumococcal strains and between s. pneumoniae and the most closely related s. mitis , while homology to iga proteases from other streptococci is significantly lower in this segment when compared to the rest of the molecule  <cit> .
the epia peptide identified in this work is conserved in all pneumococci and in two out of three s. mitis strains  <cit> , while it is not conserved in other oral streptococci sequenced so far.
the fact that the domain covered by epia is not shared with oral streptococci other than s. mitis suggests that this domain is probably not interchangeable, which reduces the risk of escape mutants by horizontal gene transfer.
in other words, this would indicate that any reservoir of divergent iga <dig> proteases in non pneumococcal species should not be imported readily by recombination into pneumococcus.
we have shown here that an immunodominant polypeptide , located within the sequence repeats domain of pneumococcal iga <dig> protease, is well conserved among several serotypes and strains of s. pneumoniae but not to the corresponding regions of the iga gene products from other streptococci such as s. oralis, s. sanguis and s. sanguinis.
however, we also found a very high sequence homology of this protein region between s. pneumoniae and s. mitis , suggesting that the observed high rate of seropositivity against pneumococcal iga <dig> protease might be due to early colonization with bacteria species other than pneumococcus.
CONCLUSIONS
the broad and specific recognition of the epia polypeptide by human sera demonstrates that the pneumococcal iga <dig> protease contains an immunodominant b-cell epitope.
in perspective, it will be of great interest to investigate the ability of the anti-epia antibodies in conferring protective immunity against s. pneumoniae infection in animal models.
the use of phage display libraries to identify microbe or disease-specific antigens recognized by the human sera is a promising and valuable approach to epitope discovery.

to characterize the biochemical and immunological properties of the selected protein fragments independently from the phage display context, the dna inserts of phages sp <dig> and sp <dig> were subcloned into vector pgex-sn  <cit> . this resulted in the expression of gst fusion proteins which were purified from e. coli cells under native conditions by 1-step affinity chromatography. the recombinant proteins were efficiently expressed and purified in large amounts from the cytoplasm of bacterial cells, with the yields of purified gst-sp <dig> and gst-sp <dig> being  <dig> and  <dig> mg per liter of bacterial culture, respectively. immunoreactivity of recombinant antigens with immunoglobulins g  of human sera was examined. to this aim, an enzyme-linked immunoassay was employed . the gst-sp <dig> and gst-sp <dig> fusion proteins were assayed with  <dig> sera collected from healthy adults. as a control, the igg reactivity against wild-type gst protein was assessed for each serum. the criterion used to assign a specific reactivity against single antigens was an odgst-antigen greater than twice the odgst. both the sp <dig> and sp <dig> polypeptides specifically reacted with more than 80% of serum samples .

next, the presence of immunodominant epitopes within the selected antigen fragments was investigated. to this purpose, the common region of sp <dig> and sp <dig> protein fragments, corresponding to amino acids 420– <dig> of pneumococcal iga <dig> protease was analyzed. figure  <dig> shows the alignment of this polypeptide of strain d <dig> to iga proteases of other pneumococci and related species. in strain d <dig> such the sequence contains three  <dig> amino acid repeats which are part of a region of the iga protease found to show high intraspecies conservation and a high degree of interspecies variability  <cit> . pneumococcal iga proteases fall in this region into two clusters: iga <dig> proteases in genomes of strains of serotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 6b all have three repeats and a common downstream region while other strains share a common downstream region with s. mitis and have from two , to seven , eight  or even nine of these highly conserved  <dig> amino acid repeats. the sequences of iga proteases of other oral streptococci such as s. sanguinis or s. oralis can not be aligned in this region since no significant homology was detected.

two gst fusion proteins, respectively carrying residues 420– <dig>  and 458– <dig>  of the iga <dig> protease from s. pneumoniae r <dig> strain were expressed. as shown in figure  <dig>  the recombinant gst-epia and gst-epib antigens were efficiently purified under native conditions from transformed e. coli cells. immunoreactivity of recombinant antigens with igg antibodies of human sera was examined and the results were compared to those obtained by use of the largest fragment of the iga <dig> protease . the gst-epia, gst-epib and gst-sp <dig> antigens were assayed by rec-elisa with serum samples from the two patients hospitalized for pneumococcal pneumonia  and from  <dig> healthy individuals. immunoreactivity of wild-type gst was also assessed for each serum. as shown in table  <dig>  the recombinant gst-sp <dig>  gst-epia and gst-epib proteins specifically reacted with  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the sera, respectively, highlighting a broad antibody recognition of all antigen fragments.

pa pserum samples from patients with pneumococcal pneumonia  and from healthy adults  were analyzed by igg rec-elisa with individual recombinant proteins.

pb pthe cutoff values were determined for each serum as two times the od readings obtained with the gst. boldface type, od values greater than the cutoff values.

because of the broad reactivity of the epia fragment, its recognition by antibodies present in sera from young children was also investigated. serum samples from forty children with an age comprised between  <dig> and  <dig> years were assayed with the recombinant gst-epia antigen by rec-elisa. as shown in fig.  <dig>  specific igg antibodies against the epia polypeptide were detected in sera from the majority of subjects , thus demonstrating that 68% of children less than  <dig> years old had specific antibodies against this short polypeptide.

next, a detailed epitope mapping was performed employing affinity-purified antibodies. specific immunoglobulins against the gst-epia fusion protein were purified from  <dig> epia-reactive sera and then assayed with the recombinant gst-epia, gst-epib and gst-sp <dig> antigens by rec-elisa. as a negative control, the igg reactivity against wild-type gst protein was also assessed. as shown in table  <dig>  the affinity-purified anti-epia antibodies specifically recognized both the epia and epib polypeptides as well as the large sp <dig> fragment, indicating that a common epitope was present in the epia and epib protein sequences.

pa precombinant antigens were ppanalyzed by igg rec-elisa with a homogeneos mixture of human sera  or with affinity-purified anti-epia antibodies

pb pthe cutoff values for the igg rec-elisa with the recombinant gst-epia, gst-epib, and gst-sp <dig> proteins were calculated as two times the od readings obtained with the gst. boldface type, od values greater than the cutoff values.

next, to exclude non-specific immunoreactivity due either to altered conformation of the small polypeptides with respect to native iga <dig> protease or to cross-reactivity of unrelated antibodies in human sera, a western blot analysis was performed. to this aim, a whole cell lysate of s. pneumoniae was challenged with the affinity-purified anti-epia antibodies. bacterial lysates from pneumococcal iga-deficient mutant strain fp <dig> and from streptococcus gordonii were assayed as controls. as shown in figure  <dig>  a unique protein band with an apparent molecular mass higher than  <dig> kda specifically reacted with the anti-epia antibodies in an unencapsulated strain of pneumococcus . in the fp <dig> mutant strain, in which the iga gene was deleted, as well as in s. gordonii, such a protein band was not visible, demonstrating that the anti-epia antibodies specifically recognized the pneumococcal enzyme.

finally, to investigate whether the epia polypeptide is exposed on the bacterium and is recognizable by anti-epia antibodies, a cell-elisa analysis was performed on whole s. pneumoniae cells. the fp <dig> strain was used as the negative control. the affinity-purified anti-epia antibodies reacted with intact bacterial cells  but not with the iga-deleted fp <dig> strain , indicating that the epia epitope within the tandem repeats of the pneumococcal enzyme is indeed exposed in the native state. noteworthy, our results are in close agreement with a previous work where it was demonstrated that the tandem repeats of s. sanguis iga <dig> protease contain immunodominant epitopes exposed in the denatured and native state  <cit> .

discussion
bacterial iga <dig> proteases are highly specific endopeptidases that are secreted by a small number of bacteria associated with humans  <cit> . iga <dig> protease-producing bacteria include the mucosal pathogens n. meningitidis, n. gonorrhoeae, h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae, u. urealyticum and some members of pharyngeal microfloras such as prevotella, gemella haemolysans, s. sanguis, s. oralis and s. mitis  <cit> . the importance of this bacterial enzyme in the interaction with the host is evidenced by the fact that most of these enzymes are specific for human iga only, and that their impact on the host is so great as to become one of the few recognised factors of positive evolutionary selection on the human genome  <cit> . for the bacterial pathogens colonizing mucosal surfaces, iga <dig> protease production represents a virulent factor and contributes to the pathogenesis of invasive infection by cleaving the fc receptor from secreted immunoglobulins a <dig>  thus preventing opsonophagocytosis  <cit> . iga <dig> proteases have been shown to be targets of enzyme-neutralizing antibodies in serum and secretions  <cit> , which may be induced in a state of bacterial carriage as well as during invasive infection  <cit> .

we previously demonstrated the potential of phage-display technology in identifying b-cell epitopes recognized by the human immune response against toxoplasma gondii and s. pneumoniae infection  <cit> , even though such a technique usually favors the identification of linear epitopes whereas conformational epitopes are often overlooked. nevertheless, the present work allowed the identification of antigenic regions of the pneumococcal iga <dig> protease that are broadly recognized by human antibodies. challenging a lambda-display library of s. pneumoniae with sera from patients hospitalized for pneumococcal pneumonia enabled the selection of three distinct clones harboring a common region of the iga <dig> protease. all clone sequences matched the pneumococcal enzyme encompassing amino acids 360– <dig>  the immunoreactivity of the selected fragments, expressed as gst fusion products, was assessed; overall, igg antibodies in serum samples from more than 90% of healthy adults reacted with at least one antigen fragment, which emphasizes the broad recognition of pneumococcal iga <dig> protease by the human b cell response.

because of the broad reactivity of the selected iga <dig> protease fragments, a detailed characterization of their common region, composed by  <dig> amino acids, was performed. this lead to classify the sequence corresponding to residues 420– <dig>  of the iga gene product as the most reactive polypeptide, which was recognized by antibodies present in sera from 90% of healthy adults and 68% of children with an age comprised between  <dig> and  <dig> years, thus suggesting that the human antibody response against iga <dig> protease occurs during childhood. noteworthy, our data are in agreement with a previous study showing that igg antibodies from the majority of children less than two years old specifically reacted with pneumococcal antigens, including the iga <dig> protease  <cit> .

the evidence that affinity-purified anti-epia antibodies also reacted with the epib fragment  indicated that a common epitope within polypeptides was recognized by human sera. notably, a repeated 9-mer sequence vvtdkgepe is present twice in epia and once in epib fragments . this duplication might account for the larger reactivity of the epia peptide with respect to the epib peptide.

the iga <dig> protease of s. pneumoniae is a major antigen expressed in all known pneumococcal strains  <cit> . despite the pneumococcal enzyme has a peculiar structure among bacterial proteases, homology searches have indicated that the iga gene of s. pneumoniae is also found in other streptococci and related organisms  <cit> . as already noted by others, the repeats region shows high conservation within the different pneumococcal strains and between s. pneumoniae and the most closely related s. mitis , while homology to iga proteases from other streptococci is significantly lower in this segment when compared to the rest of the molecule  <cit> . the epia peptide identified in this work is conserved in all pneumococci and in two out of three s. mitis strains  <cit> , while it is not conserved in other oral streptococci sequenced so far. the fact that the domain covered by epia is not shared with oral streptococci other than s. mitis suggests that this domain is probably not interchangeable, which reduces the risk of escape mutants by horizontal gene transfer. in other words, this would indicate that any reservoir of divergent iga <dig> proteases in non pneumococcal species should not be imported readily by recombination into pneumococcus.

we have shown here that an immunodominant polypeptide , located within the sequence repeats domain of pneumococcal iga <dig> protease, is well conserved among several serotypes and strains of s. pneumoniae but not to the corresponding regions of the iga gene products from other streptococci such as s. oralis, s. sanguis and s. sanguinis. however, we also found a very high sequence homology of this protein region between s. pneumoniae and s. mitis , suggesting that the observed high rate of seropositivity against pneumococcal iga <dig> protease might be due to early colonization with bacteria species other than pneumococcus.

CONCLUSIONS
the broad and specific recognition of the epia polypeptide by human sera demonstrates that the pneumococcal iga <dig> protease contains an immunodominant b-cell epitope. in perspective, it will be of great interest to investigate the ability of the anti-epia antibodies in conferring protective immunity against s. pneumoniae infection in animal models. the use of phage display libraries to identify microbe or disease-specific antigens recognized by the human sera is a promising and valuable approach to epitope discovery.

"BACKGROUND
proteins interacting with other proteins are known to play key roles in almost all cellular and biological processes such as signalling, metabolism, and trafficking.
therefore, understanding protein-protein interactions is fundamental to our ability to comprehend and control cell function.
protein complexes can be either permanent or transient.
polypeptide chains of permanent  complexes remain bound to each other throughout their functional lifetime.
an example hereof is the complex between β and γ subunits of hetero-trimeric g-proteins  <cit> .
in transient complexes, the subunits can either form a complex or detach from each other as a result of specific biological conditions.
the overall structures of these proteins are stable in the unbound as well as in the bound state.
the complex of cyclin and cyclin-dependent protein kinase is an example of such a transient complex  <cit> .
the molecular mechanism of interactions between protein-protein complexes is usually characterized by structure determination methods such as x-ray crystallography, nmr spectroscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy.
however, many complexes are too transient to lend themselves to experimental characterization.
docking simulations have recently gained importance as possible means for predicting the quaternary structures of protein-protein complexes  <cit> .
yet, these algorithms generate a large number of false-positives and false-negatives, mainly due to the inaccuracy of scoring functions  used to evaluate the docked conformations  <cit> .
docking algorithms that reconstruct known complexes using the structures of the proteins in the bound form  generally show reasonable levels of success.
however, when the structures in the unbound form are used as input , the performance of the same algorithms becomes rather poor.
this failure is mainly attributed to the inability of the algorithms and the scoring functions to take account of the conformational changes that  accompany complex formation  <cit> .
in an effort to overcome these deficiencies, one usually resorts to additional biological data, which assist in singling out the native  conformation among putative docked conformations  <cit> .
however, in the absence of prior knowledge regarding the binding site, exhaustive searches of up to  <dig> different positions and orientations are performed for the substrate  <cit> , followed by a refinement and clustering stage.
thus, it is difficult to take into account all the possible changes in internal conformations that can facilitate binding  <cit> , and detect the optimal bound state.
currently, protein-protein docking methods are often successful if the experimentally determined partner proteins undergo little conformational changes upon binding.
however, the realistic and computationally efficient treatment of conformational changes, especially of the protein backbone, during docking remains a challenge.
new promising approaches of flexible refinement, ensemble docking and explicit inclusion of flexibility during the entire docking process, have been developed  <cit> .
various strategies have been adopted to score putative protein-protein docked complexes.
most of them utilize atomic level potentials  <cit> , other employ residue level potentials  <cit> , or a combination of both  <cit> .
many of these potentials are knowledge-based  <cit> , others are force field-based  <cit> , or a combination of force field and knowledge-based potentials  <cit> .
the knowledge-based approach aims at deriving empirical interaction parameters from known structures.
the accuracy of these potentials depends on the ability to obtain reliable statistics and to correctly define the reference state.
the relatively small number of solved transient protein-protein complexes, and the small number of contacts at the interface of these complexes result in poor statistics  <cit> .
therefore, many knowledge-based potentials were derived from a dataset of protein folds   <cit>  or from datasets of transient and non-transient interfaces  <cit> .
several works show differences in amino acid composition between protein folds, transient interfaces and non-transient interfaces  <cit> .
ofran and rost  <cit>  performed a comprehensive survey of proteins, identifying six types of interfaces, each one significantly different in its amino acid composition and pairing preference.
these differences impair the ability to obtain reliable statistics and to define accurate reference states, which may well be type specific.
consequently, potentials solely derived from a dataset of transient protein complexes may be more suitable for docking simulations as only the transient complexes may need computational docking predictions.
further more, the lp technique does not require the definition of a reference state therefore the resulting potentials may not be biases toward a specific type of transient complex as shown by liu et al  <cit> .
our purpose is to develop knowledge-based protein-protein docking potentials  tailored to transient complexes that will efficiently discriminate between the structures of native and non-native complexes.
therefore, the potentials are exclusively derived from a dataset of transient complexes.
for each complex, a large number of misdocked  complexes are generated.
a set of potentials is optimized using an lp technique such that for each complex the native state has a lower energy than any of its decoys.
this approach enables us to include in our training set large amount of false positives  in addition to the true positives , thus alleviating the statistical problem of limited data.
in the present study we develop two sets of potentials, coarse-grained and atom-based, using a functional form of the potentials that is not highly sensitive to small structural changes.
this work is an extension of our previous work  <cit>  on designing coarse-grained protein-docking potentials.
however, in our current study we developed two-step potentials, because we are using a larger dataset that cannot be solved using single-step potentials.
the applicability of the new set of dps is illustrated and compared by performing a jackknife test on the zdock  <dig>  decoys set.
outline of the algorithm
the linear programming approach
we proposed to overcome the sampling problem for deriving dps by applying an lp technique to a set of transient complexes.
the utility of this technique in developing both folding and docking potentials previously has been exemplified, by us  <cit>  and by others  <cit> , after the pioneering work of maiorov and crippen  <cit> .
for each complex we generated a large number of putative docked conformations, a few compliant with the native  conformation, and the remaining 'misdocked'.
the basic requirement from the dp is to yield, for each native complex, a free energy lower than that of any misdocked complex.
each of the non-native decoys defines a constraint  on the energy function and we are looking for a set of potentials satisfying these constraints.
the advantages of this approach over the statistical approaches are twofold:  statistical approaches learn from known native states on other native states, i.e.
the  boltzmann statistics is applied to a set of known protein complexes in order to infer the structure of other native complexes.
in the lp approach, we learn from a set of native states and large sets of non-native states  on how a native state should, and should not, look like.
therefore, we have more varied data to derive the empirical potentials.
the lp approach is not sensitive to over-or under-representation or sequence/structure homologies in the training set.
protein models
the side chain based model was previously used by us to develop docking potentials  <cit> .
in short, each amino acid is represented by three interaction sites: the side chain centroid , the amide nitrogen  and the carbonyl oxygen  on the backbone .
this representation involves six types of interactions, s-s, s-o, s-n, o-n, n-n and o-o, the first three being residue-specific.
this results in a set of  <dig>  +  <dig>  +  <dig>  =  <dig> types of interactions.
the atom based model was first introduced by zhang et al.
<cit> .
each side chain is represented by all its heavy atoms which are divided into eighteen types .
this model results in  <dig> different interaction types.
<dig>  atom types were taken from the work of zhang et al.
<cit> .
<dig>  bkbn designate main chain backbone atoms.
<dig>  atom names are according to the pdb nomenclature.
energy function and parameters optimization
the dp design problem is set as follows: assume x to be the coordinate vector representing a protein structure,  the coordinates of the native complex , and {x^a:xbi}i=1n the set of n decoys generated by alternative rotations and translations of monomer b. the demand upon the energy of the native complex is to be lower than that of any of the misdocked conformations, as expressed by the set of n inequalities
{u-u > εi}i=1n
where u represents the potential energy of a complex and εi is a nonnegative constant, set to  <dig>  in the calculations below.
parameter optimization
the total energy is expressed as a linear combination of a parameter set {pl}l=1l
u=∑l=1lslpl
where {s}l=1l designates the set of l .
the functions {pl}l=1l are linear and, therefore, can be optimized using lp algorithms such as simplex or interior-point.
the functions
sl are expressed in terms of a position  dependent step function
hl={1if|rn−rm|≤rcutoffl0 otherwise
that extracts all interacting pairs m and n  within an interaction range rlcutoff characteristic of the specific type  of interaction, i.e.
sl=∑n∈a,m∈bhlδ
hereδ is the kronecker delta, which equals  <dig> if the type of interaction between sites m and n is of type l, and  <dig> otherwise.
for the side chain-based model we adopted rcutoffl values of  <dig>  Å for b-b,  <dig>  Å for b-s, and  <dig>  Å for s-s interactions, whereas for the atom-based model we adopted an rcutoffl value of  <dig>  Å. the total energy for a given decoy i is reduced to the summation over the effective pl, weighted by the numbers nli of contacts of type l occurring in the examined decoy.
the n inequalities in eq  <dig> are thus replaced by
{∑l=1253pl>εi}i=1n
where n^l is the number of contacts of type l in the native complex.
with one step contact potentials, a single cutoff distance defines the threshold below which interactions are considered to be ""on"", and above which these are considered to be ""off"".
such potentials may be too simplified to accurately describe the binding energy of interaction proteins.
alternatively, one can design multi-step contact potentials.
we replaced the step function hl byhl,d, where the superscript d refers to different distance ranges .
the energy of the ith decoy is computed from the summation over the effective docking potentials pl,d, weighted by the numbers nl,di of contacts of type l occurring at the distance interval  are thus replaced by
{∑l=1253∑d=1dpl,d>εi}i=1n
determining the cutoff value for distance ranges in multiple step potentials is not trivial.
to overcome this problem we derived a set of single step potentials using a series of successive cutoff values and measuring the correlation coefficients between potentials with adjacent cutoff values.
if the correlation is relatively low another step is created at this point.
in the side chain based-models the following steps were used: r <dig> ≤  <dig>  and  <dig>  < r <dig> ≤ <dig> Å for b-b, r <dig> ≤  <dig>  and  <dig>  <r <dig> ≤ <dig> Å for b-s, and r <dig> ≤  <dig>  and  <dig>  <r <dig> ≤ <dig>  Å for s-s interactions to get a set of  <dig> ×  <dig> =  <dig> parameters.
in the atom-based models the following steps were used: r <dig> ≤  <dig> and 4<r <dig> ≤ <dig> Å to get a set of  <dig> ×  <dig> =  <dig> parameters.
generating a population of putative docked conformations
decoys for the complexes, in their bound state, were generated in the dataset protein-protein docking benchmark  <dig>  by mintseris et al.
<cit>  .
this dataset includes  <dig> protein data bank  entries.
we adopted the docking algorithm of palma et al.
<cit> , taking into consideration only the surface matching criterion to generate docked conformations.
geometric fit was assessed from the number of overlapping surface nodes between the receptor  and the substrate .
the use of this criterion alone in the docking process enables us to generate an unbiased set of decoys, which form many contacts between the receptor and the ligand yet lacking any physicochemical basis.
for any given rotation angle, all possible docking positions were divided into cells of  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> nodes according to their translation vector, and the best matching position from each cell was preserved.
this modification of the algorithm enabled us to generate a comprehensive and unbiased set of misdocked conformations for each complex.
to reduce the large numbers of decoys generated for each complex, the conformations were further clustered using a hierarchical clustering algorithm applying a cutoff value of root mean square deviation  ≤  <dig> Å and the central conformation of each cluster was preserved.
on average,  <dig>  non-native decoys  were generated for each complex, which summed up to a total of  <dig> , <dig> non-redundant inequalities or constraints on the potentials' parameters.
another set of complexes , listed in table  <dig>  is based on the work of lo conte et al.
<cit> .
this set contains  <dig> complexes for which previously  <cit>  we had generated decoys excluding those that share more that 60% sequence identity  with any of the complexes in dataset  <dig>  dataset  <dig> was derived from the dataset of mintseris and weng  <cit>  as explained in the results section  and decoys were generated as above.
<dig>  a subset of the lo conte et al.
<cit>  dataset.
the table list pdb codes.
<dig>  a subset of the dataset of  <dig> transient complexes compiled by mintseris and weng  <cit>
numerical solution of linear inequalities
inequalities were solved as explained in our previous work  <cit> .
in short, each of the inequalities divides the parameter space into two regions, one allowed , and one forbidden.
a given inequality may affect the solution in three different ways: it may  further restrict the space allowed for the parameter set ,  have no effect on the allowed space, or  impose an impossible condition .
in the latter case no parameter set could satisfy all inequalities, making the inequalities unsolvable.
linear inequalities were solved using the interior point program bpmpd  <cit> .
test decoys
test decoys were used to compare the performance of resulting potentials in the bound and unbound states.
decoy sets containing near-native complexes were generated for the complexes in dataset  <dig> .
this dataset contains the bound and unbound structures of each of the complexes' subunits.
near-native decoys are defined as complexes having an rmsd ≤  <dig>  Å from the native state.
to each complex, docking simulations close to the native state were performed and near-native decoys were generated.
docking was performed using the algorithm of palma et al.
<cit> , taking into consideration only the surface matching criterion to generate docked conformations.
geometric fit was assessed from the number of overlapping surface nodes between the receptor and the substrate.
the docking was performed close to the native state by rotating the substrate by up to 30° and translating by up to 5Å around the native state.
these decoys were clustered using a cutoff rmsd value of ≤  <dig> Å and the central conformation of each cluster was preserved.
subsequently, the preserved decoys were sorted according to their rmsd values from the native state, and a subset of on average  <dig> decoys, uniformly spanning the entire range of near-native decoys, was selected.
this subset was combined with the above set of non-native decoys generated for each complex.
test decoys in the unbound state were generated by superimposing the unbound structures on the decoys generated in the bound state.
by doing so we generated for each complex a set of decoys containing a representative set of both non-native and near-native decoys that enabled us to accurately compare the performance of the potentials in the bound and unbound states irrespective of the docking sampling problem.
jackknife procedure
the jackknife test was performed each time by randomly selecting ten complexes from dataset  <dig>  thereupon, any complex having more than 35% sequence identity with the selected complexes was removed from datasets  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and the remaining complexes served as the training set.
new potentials were optimized using the reduced training set and tested on the selected ten complexes.
RESULTS
optimizing docking potentials
when optimizing the single-step potentials using constraints derived from dataset  <dig> we encountered a state of infeasibility both for the atom-based and the side chain-based models.
that is, no set of parameters could satisfy all the constraints.
therefore, two-steps potentials were derived.
with these potentials we were able to solve all the constraints that were derived from both dataset  <dig> and dataset  <dig>  the resulting sdps and initial set of adps  are presented in the additional file  <dig> tables s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively.
next, we scanned the dataset of transient complexes compiled by mintseris and weng  <cit>  and identified a subset of  <dig> complexes , for which not all constraints were satisfied using the present adps-i and added them to our training dataset.
thereupon, we solved all constraints derived from datasets:  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> to obtain a new set of atomic contact potentials .

the potentials are presented in table s <dig> .

the average contact energy per atom group is displayed in figure  <dig>  the adps-ii properties' and the qualitative differences between the two potentials will be discussed below.
when attempting to solve these constraints using the side chain-based model a state of infeasibility was encountered, which persisted even when using a different set of cutoff values: r <dig> ≤  <dig>  and  <dig>  < r <dig> ≤ <dig> Å for b-b, r <dig> ≤  <dig>  and  <dig>  <r <dig> ≤ <dig>  Å for b-s, and r <dig> ≤  <dig>  and  <dig>  <r <dig> ≤ <dig>  Å for s-s interactions.
optimal tolerance to structural changes
in order to test the optimal tolerance of the potentials to structural changes between the bound and unbound states of the proteins, the decoys  were ranked order exclusively based on the binding-energies.
this test enabled comparing the performances of the potentials in the bound and the unbound states regardless of the sampling.
ranking success for adps-ii is shown in figure  <dig>  in the bound state a near-native decoy is ranked in the top fifteen places in  <dig> out of  <dig> cases, and in the top fifty in  <dig> out of  <dig> cases.
in the top  <dig> places a near-native was identified in all cases.
these results are expected since these complexes were included in the training dataset.
when ranking the unbound decoys using adps-ii, in the top fifteen a near-native complex was ranked in twenty cases, and in the top fifty in twenty six cases.
in the top  <dig> ranked decoys no near-native complex was detected in sixteen cases.
in order to estimate the tolerance of the potentials to structural changes we measured the cα rmsd and heavy-atom rmsd of the interfacial amino acids  between the bound and unbound structure.
interfacial amino acids are defined as those having at least one atom in close proximity  to any atom of the other subunit.
the average irmsd vs. the ranking success of each ranked group is plotted in figure  <dig>  complexes with a near-native structure ranked in the top  <dig> places do not show significant structural change between the bound and unbound states .
complexes that are ranked in the range of 200- <dig> places are characterized by increased side chains displacements.
complexes with a near native structure not ranked in the top  <dig> places are characterized by large side chain and backbone movements .
rescoring zdock <dig>  decoys
next, we subjected the potentials to a jackknife test using the zdock <dig>  decoys   <cit> .
this test set contains  <dig> predictions for each complex in the unbound state generated by the zdock docking program.
each time ten complexes were selected randomly from dataset  <dig> .
complexes homologous to the test complexes were removed from the training dataset and new sets of adps were developed .
the new potentials were used to rank order the decoys of the test set.
this procedure was repeated five times to incorporate a total of fifty proteins.
the average correlation coefficient between adps-ii and the jackknifed potentials is  <dig>  indicating the stability of the trained parameters.
the adps-ii performance was compared with two other potentials, the common atomic contact energies   <cit>  and the newer dars  <cit> , as well with the zdock <dig>  scoring function.
a hit was defined if the irmsd ≤ 4Å, where irmsd values were taken from the zdock <dig>  decoys' supplied tables.
the results have been summarized in table  <dig>  and depicted graphically in figure  <dig>
a-complex pdb code.
b-rank of the lowest energy near-native decoy with irmsd ≤4Å out of  <dig> predictions.
c-jackknife test
-- no near-native decoy identified among the  <dig> best ranked decoys.
a near-native decoy was ranked in the top  <dig> places for twenty seven complexes using the adps-ii, for twenty two using the zdock <dig>  scoring function, for twenty using dars, and for eleven using ace.
the numbers of times the potentials failed to include a near-native case among the top  <dig> raked decoys is: seven for the adps-ii, twelve for the zdock <dig>  scoring function, seventeen for dars, and twenty two for ace.
thus, the adps-ii outperform the other potentials on this set of decoys generated by a docking program different from the one used to generate the training decoys.
the interfacial surface area of each complex was measured using the program naccess  <cit> .
no correlation was found between the size of the interfacial area and the success rate of the adps-ii.
we also compared the capabilities of the adps-ii and zdock <dig>  scoring functions to rank hits in the top ten places.
in order to be consistent with the zdock  <cit>  studies, a hit is defined if the interfacial rmsd is ≤  <dig> Å. for thirty-nine out of the fifty complexes used in the jackknife test such hits do exist in the zdock <dig>  decoy set.
the results are presented in table  <dig>  a near-native decoy was ranked in the top  <dig> places for eight  complexes using the adps-ii, and for six  using the zdock <dig>  scoring function.

discussion and
CONCLUSIONS
when trying to solve the set of inequalities derived from dataset  <dig> using the one step potentials  we encountered the state of infeasibility.
that is, no set of parameters can satisfy all inequalities.
these results indicate that neither the common functional form of atomic contact potentials  <cit>  , nor the side chain-based potentials we designed  <cit> , were adequate to discriminate at a high level between native and non-native docked complexes.
we note that infeasibility was encountered for atomic contact potentials even when using a rcutoff value of  <dig>  Å or  <dig>  Å  <cit> .
in the current study were able to overcome the problem by developing two-step potentials and doubling the number of parameters for the adps and the sdps.
two types of potentials were developed for protein-protein docking: one heavy atom based , and one side-chain based , using training datasets  <dig> and  <dig> for both cases.
when we added dataset  <dig> to the training database we were still able to solve all derived constraints using the atomic model  but not using the side-chain based model, in spite of the fact that the atomic level model has fewer parameters  than the side-chain based one .
these results are in agreement with two other publications  <cit>  showing that the discriminatory powers of atomic level potentials are superior to those of residue level potentials.
we have tested the tolerance of the resulting adps-ii to structural changes between the bound and unbound structures under optimal conditions.
that is when the complexes were included in the training set and the unbound decoys were generated by superimposing the unbound structures on the decoys generated in the bound state.
this comparison enable us the test the effect of structural changes per se.
the results  indicate that structural changes, measured by irmsd of cα/all heavy atoms of more than  <dig> Å/ <dig> Å, impair the ability of the potentials to rank a near native structure in the top  <dig> places.
here we show that the adps-ii outperforms two other contact potentials: the ace and dars.
in addition, the adps-ii outperforms the zdock <dig>  scoring function, which is a combination of desolvation energy  electrostatics and shape complementarity  <cit> .
the shape complementarity criterion alone was shown to have good ranking ability of near native structures  <cit> .
therefore, the performance of our adps-ii in conjunction with shape complementarity and electrostatics is likely to improve.
the colour coded map of the potentials is shown in figure 1a and 1b for adps-ii and in figure 1c for dars.
analysis of the adps-ii reveals that the first step potentials  are stronger in their magnitude than the second step potentials .
the average absolute value of the first and second step potentials is  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.
the standard deviation of the adps-ii is  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the first and second steps respectively and  <dig>  for the dars potentials.
thus, separating the potentials into two steps allows us to generate more varied potentials in the first step than in the second step that contains more information.
while, the variability of the single step dars potentials appear to be closer to that of the adps-ii second step.
the average interaction per atom type for the first and second step is displayed in figure  <dig>  overall, the average interactions of the first step potentials are more repulsive than the second step potentials with hydrogen bond interactions being the most attractive ones in the first step potentials.
on the other hand, in the second step potentials hydrophobic interactions are the most attractive ones.
comparing the adps-ii with the dars reveals some interesting differences.
for example, csγ-csγ interaction is the most repulsive adps-ii potential in both ranges whiles the most attractive dars potential.
we emphasize that our potentials were derived exclusively from transient complexes where the formation of cys-cys interactions are undesired, since these complexes are formed and detach from each other in response to specific biological conditions.
the dars potentials assign repulsive to neutral energies to all backbone interactions , except for the cα-cα interaction, which is attractive.
our adps-ii assign a relatively attractive energy to the c-n interactions at the close range and, therefore, captures more accurately h-bond interactions.
interestingly, and unlike the cα-cα interactions, gcα-gcα interactions also are assigned a large attractive energy.
this may reflect the flexibly and compactness of the gly side chains, allowing those to be in closer proximity with each other relative to other side chains.
most computational approaches for protein-protein docking involve a tradeoff between accuracy and computational power.
therefore, a common scheme for protein docking is an initial on grid exhaustive search  <cit>  using relatively simple scoring functions followed by off grid refinement and reranking stage using more elaborate energy functions.
several types of docking potentials were developed for these purposes.
on one hand are the relatively simple one step potentials such as dars and ace, whereas on the other hand are the multiple step potential such as the itscore-pp   <cit> .
the latter potentials were shown to successfully rank the zdock <dig>  decoy , these potentials rank a near-native  in the top  <dig> places in  <dig> % of the cases compared to a success rate of  <dig> % for our adps-ii .
the itscore-pp scoring function is very appropriate for the reranking stage of the docked structure as it requires pre-minimization of the structures to remove clashes and its resolution  is much finer than the 1Å spacing usually used for the search grid.
here we developed an intermediate level of complexity potentials, closer in their functional form to the dars and ace than to the itscore-pp.
these potentials are likely to improve the initial on grid search step.
the main challenges in designing transient protein-protein docking potentials using the boltzmann statistics are:  compiling a none-redundant and representative dataset of protein complexes and,  setting a reference state.
to develop the ace, zhang et al.
used a set of protein folds as a learning dataset and their shuffled structures as a reference state  <cit> .
chuang et al.
used a set of transient and none-transient protein interfaces as a learning set and a large set of misdocked decoys as the reference state  <cit> .
using the lp approach we were able to train our potentials using a dataset of transient complexes only with no need to define a reference state.
the ability to learn solely from transient complexes may add specificity toward this type of complexes.
the above results show that the lp approach is a good alternative to the boltzmann statistics in designing protein docking potentials.

",881,"BACKGROUND
proteins interacting with other proteins are known to play key roles in almost all cellular and biological processes such as signalling, metabolism, and trafficking. therefore, understanding protein-protein interactions is fundamental to our ability to comprehend and control cell function. protein complexes can be either permanent or transient. polypeptide chains of permanent  complexes remain bound to each other throughout their functional lifetime. an example hereof is the complex between β and γ subunits of hetero-trimeric g-proteins  <cit> . in transient complexes, the subunits can either form a complex or detach from each other as a result of specific biological conditions. the overall structures of these proteins are stable in the unbound as well as in the bound state. the complex of cyclin and cyclin-dependent protein kinase is an example of such a transient complex  <cit> .

the molecular mechanism of interactions between protein-protein complexes is usually characterized by structure determination methods such as x-ray crystallography, nmr spectroscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy. however, many complexes are too transient to lend themselves to experimental characterization. docking simulations have recently gained importance as possible means for predicting the quaternary structures of protein-protein complexes  <cit> . yet, these algorithms generate a large number of false-positives and false-negatives, mainly due to the inaccuracy of scoring functions  used to evaluate the docked conformations  <cit> .

docking algorithms that reconstruct known complexes using the structures of the proteins in the bound form  generally show reasonable levels of success. however, when the structures in the unbound form are used as input , the performance of the same algorithms becomes rather poor. this failure is mainly attributed to the inability of the algorithms and the scoring functions to take account of the conformational changes that  accompany complex formation  <cit> . in an effort to overcome these deficiencies, one usually resorts to additional biological data, which assist in singling out the native  conformation among putative docked conformations  <cit> . however, in the absence of prior knowledge regarding the binding site, exhaustive searches of up to  <dig> different positions and orientations are performed for the substrate  <cit> , followed by a refinement and clustering stage. thus, it is difficult to take into account all the possible changes in internal conformations that can facilitate binding  <cit> , and detect the optimal bound state. currently, protein-protein docking methods are often successful if the experimentally determined partner proteins undergo little conformational changes upon binding. however, the realistic and computationally efficient treatment of conformational changes, especially of the protein backbone, during docking remains a challenge. new promising approaches of flexible refinement, ensemble docking and explicit inclusion of flexibility during the entire docking process, have been developed  <cit> .

various strategies have been adopted to score putative protein-protein docked complexes. most of them utilize atomic level potentials  <cit> , other employ residue level potentials  <cit> , or a combination of both  <cit> . many of these potentials are knowledge-based  <cit> , others are force field-based  <cit> , or a combination of force field and knowledge-based potentials  <cit> .

the knowledge-based approach aims at deriving empirical interaction parameters from known structures. the accuracy of these potentials depends on the ability to obtain reliable statistics and to correctly define the reference state. the relatively small number of solved transient protein-protein complexes, and the small number of contacts at the interface of these complexes result in poor statistics  <cit> . therefore, many knowledge-based potentials were derived from a dataset of protein folds   <cit>  or from datasets of transient and non-transient interfaces  <cit> .

several works show differences in amino acid composition between protein folds, transient interfaces and non-transient interfaces  <cit> . ofran and rost  <cit>  performed a comprehensive survey of proteins, identifying six types of interfaces, each one significantly different in its amino acid composition and pairing preference. these differences impair the ability to obtain reliable statistics and to define accurate reference states, which may well be type specific. consequently, potentials solely derived from a dataset of transient protein complexes may be more suitable for docking simulations as only the transient complexes may need computational docking predictions. further more, the lp technique does not require the definition of a reference state therefore the resulting potentials may not be biases toward a specific type of transient complex as shown by liu et al  <cit> .

our purpose is to develop knowledge-based protein-protein docking potentials  tailored to transient complexes that will efficiently discriminate between the structures of native and non-native complexes. therefore, the potentials are exclusively derived from a dataset of transient complexes. for each complex, a large number of misdocked  complexes are generated. a set of potentials is optimized using an lp technique such that for each complex the native state has a lower energy than any of its decoys. this approach enables us to include in our training set large amount of false positives  in addition to the true positives , thus alleviating the statistical problem of limited data. in the present study we develop two sets of potentials, coarse-grained and atom-based, using a functional form of the potentials that is not highly sensitive to small structural changes.

this work is an extension of our previous work  <cit>  on designing coarse-grained protein-docking potentials. however, in our current study we developed two-step potentials, because we are using a larger dataset that cannot be solved using single-step potentials. the applicability of the new set of dps is illustrated and compared by performing a jackknife test on the zdock  <dig>  decoys set.

outline of the algorithm
the linear programming approach
we proposed to overcome the sampling problem for deriving dps by applying an lp technique to a set of transient complexes. the utility of this technique in developing both folding and docking potentials previously has been exemplified, by us  <cit>  and by others  <cit> , after the pioneering work of maiorov and crippen  <cit> . for each complex we generated a large number of putative docked conformations, a few compliant with the native  conformation, and the remaining 'misdocked'. the basic requirement from the dp is to yield, for each native complex, a free energy lower than that of any misdocked complex. each of the non-native decoys defines a constraint  on the energy function and we are looking for a set of potentials satisfying these constraints. the advantages of this approach over the statistical approaches are twofold:  statistical approaches learn from known native states on other native states, i.e. the  boltzmann statistics is applied to a set of known protein complexes in order to infer the structure of other native complexes. in the lp approach, we learn from a set of native states and large sets of non-native states  on how a native state should, and should not, look like. therefore, we have more varied data to derive the empirical potentials.  the lp approach is not sensitive to over-or under-representation or sequence/structure homologies in the training set.

protein models
the side chain based model was previously used by us to develop docking potentials  <cit> . in short, each amino acid is represented by three interaction sites: the side chain centroid , the amide nitrogen  and the carbonyl oxygen  on the backbone . this representation involves six types of interactions, s-s, s-o, s-n, o-n, n-n and o-o, the first three being residue-specific. this results in a set of  <dig>  +  <dig>  +  <dig>  =  <dig> types of interactions. the atom based model was first introduced by zhang et al.  <cit> . each side chain is represented by all its heavy atoms which are divided into eighteen types . this model results in  <dig> different interaction types.

 <dig>  atom types were taken from the work of zhang et al.  <cit> .

 <dig>  bkbn designate main chain backbone atoms.

 <dig>  atom names are according to the pdb nomenclature.

energy function and parameters optimization
the dp design problem is set as follows: assume x to be the coordinate vector representing a protein structure,  the coordinates of the native complex , and {x^a:xbi}i=1n the set of n decoys generated by alternative rotations and translations of monomer b. the demand upon the energy of the native complex is to be lower than that of any of the misdocked conformations, as expressed by the set of n inequalities

  {u-u > εi}i=1n 

where u represents the potential energy of a complex and εi is a nonnegative constant, set to  <dig>  in the calculations below.

parameter optimization
the total energy is expressed as a linear combination of a parameter set {pl}l=1l

  u=∑l=1lslpl 

where {s}l=1l designates the set of l . the functions {pl}l=1l are linear and, therefore, can be optimized using lp algorithms such as simplex or interior-point. the functions
sl are expressed in terms of a position  dependent step function

  hl={1if|rn−rm|≤rcutoffl0 otherwise 

that extracts all interacting pairs m and n  within an interaction range rlcutoff characteristic of the specific type  of interaction, i.e.

  sl=∑n∈a,m∈bhlδ 

hereδ is the kronecker delta, which equals  <dig> if the type of interaction between sites m and n is of type l, and  <dig> otherwise. for the side chain-based model we adopted rcutoffl values of  <dig>  Å for b-b,  <dig>  Å for b-s, and  <dig>  Å for s-s interactions, whereas for the atom-based model we adopted an rcutoffl value of  <dig>  Å. the total energy for a given decoy i is reduced to the summation over the effective pl, weighted by the numbers nli of contacts of type l occurring in the examined decoy. the n inequalities in eq  <dig> are thus replaced by

  {∑l=1253pl>εi}i=1n 

where n^l is the number of contacts of type l in the native complex.

with one step contact potentials, a single cutoff distance defines the threshold below which interactions are considered to be ""on"", and above which these are considered to be ""off"". such potentials may be too simplified to accurately describe the binding energy of interaction proteins. alternatively, one can design multi-step contact potentials. we replaced the step function hl byhl,d, where the superscript d refers to different distance ranges . the energy of the ith decoy is computed from the summation over the effective docking potentials pl,d, weighted by the numbers nl,di of contacts of type l occurring at the distance interval  are thus replaced by

  {∑l=1253∑d=1dpl,d>εi}i=1n 

determining the cutoff value for distance ranges in multiple step potentials is not trivial. to overcome this problem we derived a set of single step potentials using a series of successive cutoff values and measuring the correlation coefficients between potentials with adjacent cutoff values. if the correlation is relatively low another step is created at this point. in the side chain based-models the following steps were used: r <dig> ≤  <dig>  and  <dig>  < r <dig> ≤ <dig> Å for b-b, r <dig> ≤  <dig>  and  <dig>  <r <dig> ≤ <dig> Å for b-s, and r <dig> ≤  <dig>  and  <dig>  <r <dig> ≤ <dig>  Å for s-s interactions to get a set of  <dig> ×  <dig> =  <dig> parameters. in the atom-based models the following steps were used: r <dig> ≤  <dig> and 4<r <dig> ≤ <dig> Å to get a set of  <dig> ×  <dig> =  <dig> parameters.

generating a population of putative docked conformations
decoys for the complexes, in their bound state, were generated in the dataset protein-protein docking benchmark  <dig>  by mintseris et al.  <cit>  . this dataset includes  <dig> protein data bank  entries. we adopted the docking algorithm of palma et al.  <cit> , taking into consideration only the surface matching criterion to generate docked conformations. geometric fit was assessed from the number of overlapping surface nodes between the receptor  and the substrate . the use of this criterion alone in the docking process enables us to generate an unbiased set of decoys, which form many contacts between the receptor and the ligand yet lacking any physicochemical basis. for any given rotation angle, all possible docking positions were divided into cells of  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> nodes according to their translation vector, and the best matching position from each cell was preserved. this modification of the algorithm enabled us to generate a comprehensive and unbiased set of misdocked conformations for each complex. to reduce the large numbers of decoys generated for each complex, the conformations were further clustered using a hierarchical clustering algorithm applying a cutoff value of root mean square deviation  ≤  <dig> Å and the central conformation of each cluster was preserved. on average,  <dig>  non-native decoys  were generated for each complex, which summed up to a total of  <dig> , <dig> non-redundant inequalities or constraints on the potentials' parameters. another set of complexes , listed in table  <dig>  is based on the work of lo conte et al.  <cit> . this set contains  <dig> complexes for which previously  <cit>  we had generated decoys excluding those that share more that 60% sequence identity  with any of the complexes in dataset  <dig>  dataset  <dig> was derived from the dataset of mintseris and weng  <cit>  as explained in the results section  and decoys were generated as above.

numerical solution of linear inequalities
inequalities were solved as explained in our previous work  <cit> . in short, each of the inequalities divides the parameter space into two regions, one allowed , and one forbidden. a given inequality may affect the solution in three different ways: it may  further restrict the space allowed for the parameter set ,  have no effect on the allowed space, or  impose an impossible condition . in the latter case no parameter set could satisfy all inequalities, making the inequalities unsolvable. linear inequalities were solved using the interior point program bpmpd  <cit> .

test decoys
test decoys were used to compare the performance of resulting potentials in the bound and unbound states. decoy sets containing near-native complexes were generated for the complexes in dataset  <dig> . this dataset contains the bound and unbound structures of each of the complexes' subunits. near-native decoys are defined as complexes having an rmsd ≤  <dig>  Å from the native state. to each complex, docking simulations close to the native state were performed and near-native decoys were generated. docking was performed using the algorithm of palma et al.  <cit> , taking into consideration only the surface matching criterion to generate docked conformations. geometric fit was assessed from the number of overlapping surface nodes between the receptor and the substrate. the docking was performed close to the native state by rotating the substrate by up to 30° and translating by up to 5Å around the native state. these decoys were clustered using a cutoff rmsd value of ≤  <dig> Å and the central conformation of each cluster was preserved. subsequently, the preserved decoys were sorted according to their rmsd values from the native state, and a subset of on average  <dig> decoys, uniformly spanning the entire range of near-native decoys, was selected. this subset was combined with the above set of non-native decoys generated for each complex. test decoys in the unbound state were generated by superimposing the unbound structures on the decoys generated in the bound state. by doing so we generated for each complex a set of decoys containing a representative set of both non-native and near-native decoys that enabled us to accurately compare the performance of the potentials in the bound and unbound states irrespective of the docking sampling problem.

jackknife procedure
the jackknife test was performed each time by randomly selecting ten complexes from dataset  <dig>  thereupon, any complex having more than 35% sequence identity with the selected complexes was removed from datasets  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and the remaining complexes served as the training set. new potentials were optimized using the reduced training set and tested on the selected ten complexes.

RESULTS
optimizing docking potentials
when optimizing the single-step potentials using constraints derived from dataset  <dig> we encountered a state of infeasibility both for the atom-based and the side chain-based models. that is, no set of parameters could satisfy all the constraints. therefore, two-steps potentials were derived. with these potentials we were able to solve all the constraints that were derived from both dataset  <dig> and dataset  <dig>  the resulting sdps and initial set of adps  are presented in the additional file  <dig> tables s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively. next, we scanned the dataset of transient complexes compiled by mintseris and weng  <cit>  and identified a subset of  <dig> complexes , for which not all constraints were satisfied using the present adps-i and added them to our training dataset. thereupon, we solved all constraints derived from datasets:  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> to obtain a new set of atomic contact potentials . ). the potentials are presented in table s <dig> . in figure  <dig>  panels  and  display the maps of the first and second steps of the adps-ii, respectively, whereas panel  displays the single step decoys as the reference state   <cit>  potentials. the average contact energy per atom group is displayed in figure  <dig>  the adps-ii properties' and the qualitative differences between the two potentials will be discussed below. when attempting to solve these constraints using the side chain-based model a state of infeasibility was encountered, which persisted even when using a different set of cutoff values: r <dig> ≤  <dig>  and  <dig>  < r <dig> ≤ <dig> Å for b-b, r <dig> ≤  <dig>  and  <dig>  <r <dig> ≤ <dig>  Å for b-s, and r <dig> ≤  <dig>  and  <dig>  <r <dig> ≤ <dig>  Å for s-s interactions.

optimal tolerance to structural changes
in order to test the optimal tolerance of the potentials to structural changes between the bound and unbound states of the proteins, the decoys  were ranked order exclusively based on the binding-energies. this test enabled comparing the performances of the potentials in the bound and the unbound states regardless of the sampling. ranking success for adps-ii is shown in figure  <dig>  in the bound state a near-native decoy is ranked in the top fifteen places in  <dig> out of  <dig> cases, and in the top fifty in  <dig> out of  <dig> cases. in the top  <dig> places a near-native was identified in all cases. these results are expected since these complexes were included in the training dataset. when ranking the unbound decoys using adps-ii, in the top fifteen a near-native complex was ranked in twenty cases, and in the top fifty in twenty six cases. in the top  <dig> ranked decoys no near-native complex was detected in sixteen cases.

in order to estimate the tolerance of the potentials to structural changes we measured the cα rmsd and heavy-atom rmsd of the interfacial amino acids  between the bound and unbound structure. interfacial amino acids are defined as those having at least one atom in close proximity  to any atom of the other subunit. the average irmsd vs. the ranking success of each ranked group is plotted in figure  <dig>  complexes with a near-native structure ranked in the top  <dig> places do not show significant structural change between the bound and unbound states . complexes that are ranked in the range of 200- <dig> places are characterized by increased side chains displacements. complexes with a near native structure not ranked in the top  <dig> places are characterized by large side chain and backbone movements .

rescoring zdock <dig>  decoys
next, we subjected the potentials to a jackknife test using the zdock <dig>  decoys   <cit> . this test set contains  <dig> predictions for each complex in the unbound state generated by the zdock docking program. each time ten complexes were selected randomly from dataset  <dig> . complexes homologous to the test complexes were removed from the training dataset and new sets of adps were developed . the new potentials were used to rank order the decoys of the test set. this procedure was repeated five times to incorporate a total of fifty proteins. the average correlation coefficient between adps-ii and the jackknifed potentials is  <dig>  indicating the stability of the trained parameters. the adps-ii performance was compared with two other potentials, the common atomic contact energies   <cit>  and the newer dars  <cit> , as well with the zdock <dig>  scoring function. a hit was defined if the irmsd ≤ 4Å, where irmsd values were taken from the zdock <dig>  decoys' supplied tables. the results have been summarized in table  <dig>  and depicted graphically in figure  <dig>

a near-native decoy was ranked in the top  <dig> places for twenty seven complexes using the adps-ii, for twenty two using the zdock <dig>  scoring function, for twenty using dars, and for eleven using ace. the numbers of times the potentials failed to include a near-native case among the top  <dig> raked decoys is: seven for the adps-ii, twelve for the zdock <dig>  scoring function, seventeen for dars, and twenty two for ace. thus, the adps-ii outperform the other potentials on this set of decoys generated by a docking program different from the one used to generate the training decoys. the interfacial surface area of each complex was measured using the program naccess  <cit> . no correlation was found between the size of the interfacial area and the success rate of the adps-ii.

we also compared the capabilities of the adps-ii and zdock <dig>  scoring functions to rank hits in the top ten places. in order to be consistent with the zdock  <cit>  studies, a hit is defined if the interfacial rmsd is ≤  <dig> Å. for thirty-nine out of the fifty complexes used in the jackknife test such hits do exist in the zdock <dig>  decoy set. the results are presented in table  <dig>  a near-native decoy was ranked in the top  <dig> places for eight  complexes using the adps-ii, and for six  using the zdock <dig>  scoring function.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
when trying to solve the set of inequalities derived from dataset  <dig> using the one step potentials  we encountered the state of infeasibility. that is, no set of parameters can satisfy all inequalities. these results indicate that neither the common functional form of atomic contact potentials  <cit>  , nor the side chain-based potentials we designed  <cit> , were adequate to discriminate at a high level between native and non-native docked complexes. we note that infeasibility was encountered for atomic contact potentials even when using a rcutoff value of  <dig>  Å or  <dig>  Å  <cit> . in the current study were able to overcome the problem by developing two-step potentials and doubling the number of parameters for the adps and the sdps.

two types of potentials were developed for protein-protein docking: one heavy atom based , and one side-chain based , using training datasets  <dig> and  <dig> for both cases. when we added dataset  <dig> to the training database we were still able to solve all derived constraints using the atomic model  but not using the side-chain based model, in spite of the fact that the atomic level model has fewer parameters  than the side-chain based one . these results are in agreement with two other publications  <cit>  showing that the discriminatory powers of atomic level potentials are superior to those of residue level potentials.

we have tested the tolerance of the resulting adps-ii to structural changes between the bound and unbound structures under optimal conditions. that is when the complexes were included in the training set and the unbound decoys were generated by superimposing the unbound structures on the decoys generated in the bound state. this comparison enable us the test the effect of structural changes per se. the results  indicate that structural changes, measured by irmsd of cα/all heavy atoms of more than  <dig> Å/ <dig> Å, impair the ability of the potentials to rank a near native structure in the top  <dig> places.

here we show that the adps-ii outperforms two other contact potentials: the ace and dars. in addition, the adps-ii outperforms the zdock <dig>  scoring function, which is a combination of desolvation energy  electrostatics and shape complementarity  <cit> . the shape complementarity criterion alone was shown to have good ranking ability of near native structures  <cit> . therefore, the performance of our adps-ii in conjunction with shape complementarity and electrostatics is likely to improve.

the colour coded map of the potentials is shown in figure 1a and 1b for adps-ii and in figure 1c for dars. analysis of the adps-ii reveals that the first step potentials  are stronger in their magnitude than the second step potentials . the average absolute value of the first and second step potentials is  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the standard deviation of the adps-ii is  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the first and second steps respectively and  <dig>  for the dars potentials. thus, separating the potentials into two steps allows us to generate more varied potentials in the first step than in the second step that contains more information. while, the variability of the single step dars potentials appear to be closer to that of the adps-ii second step. the average interaction per atom type for the first and second step is displayed in figure  <dig>  overall, the average interactions of the first step potentials are more repulsive than the second step potentials with hydrogen bond interactions being the most attractive ones in the first step potentials. on the other hand, in the second step potentials hydrophobic interactions are the most attractive ones. comparing the adps-ii with the dars reveals some interesting differences. for example, csγ-csγ interaction is the most repulsive adps-ii potential in both ranges whiles the most attractive dars potential. we emphasize that our potentials were derived exclusively from transient complexes where the formation of cys-cys interactions are undesired, since these complexes are formed and detach from each other in response to specific biological conditions. the dars potentials assign repulsive to neutral energies to all backbone interactions , except for the cα-cα interaction, which is attractive. our adps-ii assign a relatively attractive energy to the c-n interactions at the close range and, therefore, captures more accurately h-bond interactions. interestingly, and unlike the cα-cα interactions, gcα-gcα interactions also are assigned a large attractive energy. this may reflect the flexibly and compactness of the gly side chains, allowing those to be in closer proximity with each other relative to other side chains.

most computational approaches for protein-protein docking involve a tradeoff between accuracy and computational power. therefore, a common scheme for protein docking is an initial on grid exhaustive search  <cit>  using relatively simple scoring functions followed by off grid refinement and reranking stage using more elaborate energy functions. several types of docking potentials were developed for these purposes. on one hand are the relatively simple one step potentials such as dars and ace, whereas on the other hand are the multiple step potential such as the itscore-pp   <cit> . the latter potentials were shown to successfully rank the zdock <dig>  decoy , these potentials rank a near-native  in the top  <dig> places in  <dig> % of the cases compared to a success rate of  <dig> % for our adps-ii . the itscore-pp scoring function is very appropriate for the reranking stage of the docked structure as it requires pre-minimization of the structures to remove clashes and its resolution  is much finer than the 1Å spacing usually used for the search grid. here we developed an intermediate level of complexity potentials, closer in their functional form to the dars and ace than to the itscore-pp. these potentials are likely to improve the initial on grid search step.

the main challenges in designing transient protein-protein docking potentials using the boltzmann statistics are:  compiling a none-redundant and representative dataset of protein complexes and,  setting a reference state. to develop the ace, zhang et al. used a set of protein folds as a learning dataset and their shuffled structures as a reference state  <cit> . chuang et al.  used a set of transient and none-transient protein interfaces as a learning set and a large set of misdocked decoys as the reference state  <cit> . using the lp approach we were able to train our potentials using a dataset of transient complexes only with no need to define a reference state. the ability to learn solely from transient complexes may add specificity toward this type of complexes. the above results show that the lp approach is a good alternative to the boltzmann statistics in designing protein docking potentials.

","BACKGROUND
protein-protein docking is a challenging computational problem in functional genomics, particularly when one or both proteins undergo conformational change upon binding. the major challenge is to define a scoring function soft enough to tolerate these changes and specific enough to distinguish between near-native and ""misdocked"" conformations.


RESULTS
using a linear programming  technique, we developed two types of potentials:  side chain-based and  heavy atom-based. to achieve this we considered a set of  <dig> transient complexes and generated a large set of putative docked structures , based on a shape complementarity criterion, for each complex. the demand on the potentials was to yield, for the native  structure, a potential energy lower than those of any of the non-native  structures. we show that the heavy atom-based potentials were able to comply with this requirement but not the side chain-based one. thus, despite the smaller number of parameters, the capability of heavy atom-based potentials to discriminate between native and ""misdocked"" conformations is improved relative to those of the side chain-based potentials. the performance of the atom-based potentials was evaluated by a jackknife test on a set of  <dig> complexes taken from the zdock <dig>  decoys set.

"BACKGROUND
enzymes are mostly protein based biomolecules that accelerate the rate of chemical reactions in a living organism.
enzymes are made of amino acids whose unique characteristic composition enables them to have different functionalities and also making them work efficiently at stable conditions, such as optimum temperature and ph.
thus, any mutation that occurs in this amino acid sequence may change the enzyme's 3d-structure, catalytic activity or stability, or even making the enzyme completely non-functional.
therefore, the knowledge of mutations and their impacts are of crucial importance in order to completely understand mechanisms of enzymes' functionality, and stability.
many experimental studies have focused on finding the effects of mutations on enzymes.
for example, many studies have aimed to create enzymes with novel properties such as designing hyperthermophilic enzymes  <cit>  or expanding the substrate specificity of an enzyme  <cit> .
the published results of these projects provide scientific information for researchers who are engaged in finding an impact of mutation on an enzyme.
though many databases are available on the nomenclature of enzymes  <cit>  or structure and function  <cit> , to our knowledge only brenda   <cit> , the largest manually curated enzyme-specific information system, contains an information on engineered enzymes and their effects on the enzyme's catalytic activity while directly referring to scientific literature.
manually curated databases are both slow and expensive for extracting information from scientific literature.
there is a need for an efficient automatic extraction method that allows accessing relevant information rapidly with great efficiency, and possibly at any time.
with the latest developments in information extraction, biomedical term recognition has become an important area for researchers.
dictionary-based, rule-based, and machine learning-based approaches are used to extract names of genes, proteins and other cellular substances  <cit> .
several systems have already been developed for automatic extractions of mutations from biomedical literature.
mutext, for example, developed by horn et al.
<cit>  is one of the initial works that focused on extracting single point mutations from scientific literature.
moreover, a gold standard data set  <cit>  is created for comparing the performance of mutation extraction systems and systematic evaluations  <cit>  for these systems are developed with a precise definition of evaluation metrics.
the next step in mutation informatics is finding relation of mutations to other biological entities such as genes or proteins.
rebholz-schuhmann et al.
<cit>  developed mema, which extracts disease-related mutation-gene pairs from medline abstracts.
in mema, identification of both gene names and mutations are based on regular expressions compiled into two different finite state automations.
if the abstract or the sentence that the mutation is extracted from contains only one gene name, the detected mutation is associated to that particular gene.
however, if there is more than one gene name, the mema uses syntactical rules and proximity parameters as a criterion for decision.
mugex  uses a similar approach developed by erdogmus et al.
<cit>  in order to extract disease related protein mutations.
mugex makes use of regular expressions in identifying possible mutations.
however, it also handles ambiguous mutation citations by using machine learning techniques.
for gene name identification, it uses a dictionary-based approach and then associates the extracted entities according to proximity measures.
for mutation-protein associations, lee et al.
<cit>  developed mutation grab, which identifies mutations using regular expressions, similar to the previous methods  <cit> .
protein identification is also performed with regular expressions, which search for a dictionary of protein names and synonyms.
lastly, mutation grab uses graphs in which shortest-distance search and word bigram analysis are used in order to find the associations between mutations and proteins.
mutationminer which is developed by baker et al.
<cit>  follows a different approach than the previous systems.
it mainly focuses on associations between mutations and protein structure visualizations using nlp techniques.
the system identifies the proteins and mutations in the form of name entities and if cited in the same sentence, the mutationminer associates them to one another.
moreover, this system has been improved of late with the support of biological ontologies which make mutation annotations available in a semantically consistent format, and with the owl ontology which enables the automated means of accessing knowledge possible  <cit> .
the above information extraction techniques became necessary because of the increased number of electronic documents.
at the same time, however, the task to classify these documents based on their contents makes document classification an important field for researchers.
especially after integrating machine learning techniques to document classification, its accuracy has now became comparable to the less than 100% accuracy of human expertise  <cit> .
therefore, because of growing interest and high accuracy rates, document classification has been used in different applications such as document organization  <cit> , word sense disambiguation  <cit>  or web document classification  <cit> .
although the above works make it possible to associate mutations to other biological entities, the experimental results documented in scientific literature cannot be extracted with the techniques discussed above.
therefore, in case of mutation informatics, the next step is to extract information describing the effects of the mutations  <cit> .
the writers of this paper developed enzyminer, which is capable of automatically extracting protein mutations from pubmed  <cit>  abstracts for a given enzyme and classifying their impact on the enzyme's functionality and stability.
in the case of mutation identification, the information extraction and document classification methods are used.
for impact analysis, document classification techniques are again used for identifying the abstracts that contain a change in the stability conditions or catalytic activity of an enzyme resulted from a mutation.
methods
algorithm
mutation extraction
in this work, we focus on amino acid level protein mutations.
in order to extract this kind of mutation from pubmed abstracts, we used mugex  <cit> 's mutation extraction and disambiguation modules which are based on regular expressions and machine learning techniques.
a set of  <dig> patterns was formed using phrases that contain protein mutations for regular expression matching in mugex.
next, pattern matching was applied to each sentence of the abstracts in order to identify mutations.
one major drawback of using regular expressions is that they are too general to be able to capture only the protein level mutations.
a nucleotide mutation such as g32a, or the name of a strain or a cell line, such as h4s may easily be misinterpreted as a protein mutation.
in order to eliminate such ambiguities, mugex makes use of machine learning techniques.
document classification on topic and content sections of these abstracts identifies them as to whether or not a protein mutation is present.
seperating disease related abstracts
enzymes are essential for a number of functions in the cell; therefore, any malfunctioning of an enzyme caused by a mutation may be found in relation to a disease.
thus, many research projects are conducted to find the relation between enzyme mutations and diseases.
since, medline is the largest component of pubmed, all the abstracts of these medical projects are included in the pubmed database.
therefore, when we download all the abstracts that contain the term ""mutation"" and a specific enzyme name, the medical abstracts are also accompanied in the downloaded information.
however, these abstracts contains the general focus on the mutations' effects on the disease development, but not on the functionality or the stability of enzymes.
for instance, lipoprotein lipase hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins.
mutations in the gene encoding for lipoprotein lipase can lead to lipoprotein lipase deficiency that in turn leads to an increase in the levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream.
therefore, many abstracts that contain both the words ""mutation"" and ""lipase"" are about research aiming to find the specific mutations that cause this disease.
similarly, the disease related abstracts do not contain the information on direct impact of the mutation on the enzyme functionality or stability.
for that reason, including these abstracts into our classification will mislead our results.
in order to prevent corruption of the data, we initially classify the abstracts into two groups:  disease related abstracts and  non-disease related abstracts.
dictionary based approaches  <cit>  that make use of medical subject headings  or unified medical language system  are previously used for identifying disease related abstracts.
on the other hand, various document classification algorithms are also employed for clinical text classification between disease related documents such as clinical patient records  <cit> .
in enzyminer, we used document classification approach for grouping our abstracts into disease related or non-disease related abstracts.
therefore, user is giving the option of choosing disease related or non-disease related abstracts, and base of their selection a list of mutations and their impacts on the enzyme are displayed on the web with direct references to the relevant scientific literature.
impacts of mutation
enzymatic reaction rates depend on physico-chemical conditions, such as ph and temperature.
when these conditions are optimum, the enzyme attains its maximal activity.
however, at high temperatures or extreme ph changes, the enzyme may become inactive as a result of denaturation.
stability is the condition in which an enzyme can maintain its structural conformation and activity, yet, a mutation may cause changes in these conditions.
for instance, a mutation that decreases the molecular flexibility of an enzyme sometimes may lead to higher thermostability, or a mutation that replaces glycine with a basic or acidic residue may cause significant changes in the enzyme's optimum ph.
therefore, to understand the governing rules of protein structure stability, researchers carry out mutation studies and check the impact on stability at different temperatures and ph.
likewise, an enzyme's functionality is also affected by mutations.
unlike most of the chemical catalysts, enzymes are highly selective to their substrates and this specificity is mainly determined by three dimensional coordinates of the active site.
therefore, a mutation that modifies the conformation of an enzyme, especially the catalytic site, may cease its function.
a mutation that changes the spatial coordinates of the active site can change enzyme specificity for a specific molecule.
on the other hand, all the mutations may not necessarily have a significant effect on the enzyme's stability conditions or catalytic functions.
there are experimental results, for example, which show that some mutations have no impact.
the abstracts that include only these kinds of mutations have to be filtered out since our main purpose is to find the abstracts that contain impacts of mutations on enzymes.
we represented this challenge as a classification problem and removed the abstracts that are classified as no change abstracts from our data set.
system architecture
the system architecture of enzyminer is shown in figure  <dig>  our system is composed of three stages:  preprocessing,  mutation extraction and  impact analysis.
in this work, we focused on the abstracts from pubmed.
abstracts published after january  <dig>   <dig>  which contain an enzyme and the possible variations of the term ""mutation"" are downloaded.
in order to include possible variations of ""mutation"" into our search query, a truncated form of word ""mutation"" was used.
in the case of enzymes, we only used the trivial names in our search queries that supposedly used by all researchers.
further, including ec numbers to our search seems unnecessary since in the abstracts ec numbers are rarely used as the extra information near the enzymes' common names.
since our initial aim was to identify pubmed articles that are focused on a specific enzyme and possible protein mutations, we performed our search restricted to only the 'title' and the 'abstract' sections.
if the searched words are not found in the abstract but found in the other fields, such pubmed entry was not downloaded.
while in the preprocessing stage, the downloaded pubmed abstracts are first parsed, and then tokenization followed by sentence splitting operations were performed on these parsed abstracts for the successive stages.
as for as the mutation extraction stage is concerned, we used mugex  <cit>  which is developed by our group to extract disease related mutation-gene pairs.
mugex consists of two stages and each stage has several modules.
since this work requires us to identify only protein mutations, we therefore used mutation extraction and disambiguation modules of mugex.
mutation extraction module makes use of pattern matching with regular expressions to find the possible protein mutations from the text.
all of the regular expressions are based on one pattern that starts with an amino acid as the one letter code followed by a number, and ends with another amino acid as another one letter code .
by making modification to this pattern, a set of  <dig> patterns was formed in order to find remaining mutation patterns.
regular expressions are able to identify protein mutations.
however, as indicated previously, the main challenge in amino-acid-level mutation extraction is to distinguish actual protein mutations from nucleotide mutations, or mutation like terms such as the name of a strain or a cell line.
disambiguation module of mugex eliminates these kinds of ambiguities by using document classification as a word sense disambiguation application.
this module uses rainbow  <cit> , one of the front ends of the bow library designed for document classification, so as to decide the abstracts that contain potentially ambiguous mutations.
a training benchmark that consists of  <dig>  randomly selected medline abstracts is formed and all of these abstracts were labeled by experts.
out of these, a total of  <dig> abstracts contained protein mutations while the remaining abstracts contain either nucleotide mutations or biological entities that are cited with mutation-like terms.
using these labeled abstracts, the disambiguation module trains a model for classification while processing the abstracts by performing stemming, alphanumeric tokenization and considering word bigrams.
after the preprocessing stage, enzyminer identifies all possible protein mutations in the downloaded abstracts using the mutation extraction module.
then the ambiguous abstracts are queried to the disambiguation module where they are classified using naive bayes algorithm, which is trained with the above model.
at the end of this stage, abstracts that contain protein mutations are queried to the classification modules of the impact analysis stage for further classification.
impact analysis stage consists of three classification modules.
firstly, the disease vs. non-disease classification module separates abstracts into two groups.
if the user is interested only in disease related abstracts, the abstracts that are classified as disease related are displayed on the web with a list of protein mutations.
on the other hand, non-disease related abstracts are queried to change vs. no change classification module and the ones that do not contain any change in an enzyme's functionality or stability are eliminated.
lastly, in the stability vs. catalytic classification module, the remaining abstracts were sub-classified into two groups: ones that contain a change in stability of the protein structure, for those involved in catalytic activity as shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig>
in all the classification modules of the impact analysis stage, rainbow was used as a document classifier.
it assigns a document to the class with the highest score.
however, the scores of the other classes are also given in the results.
in the classification modules such as disease vs. not disease classification and change vs. no change, the abstracts in the test set are assigned to the class with the highest classification score.
on the other hand, for the stability vs. catalytic classification module, before assigning an abstract to one of the classes, the difference between the scores of the two classes was checked.
if the difference is less than  <dig> , such abstract was assigned to both classes, because an abstract may contain a change in both the stability as well as the catalytic activity.
furthermore, it is to be noted that in the classification modules, all possible words from the vocabulary are adapted as a feature during the classification.
implementation
all the steps at the preprocessing stage are developed using flex  <cit>  and bison  <cit> .
in the mutation extraction module, all regular expressions were compiled with the help of a c++ regular expression library.
the disambiguation module makes use of rainbow  <cit>  in order to identify the abstracts that contain potentially ambiguous mutations.
similarly, rainbow was used as a document classifier in all the classification modules of the impact analysis stage.
during the steps shown in the figure  <dig>  all necessary information for the downloaded abstracts are inserted into a database.
whenever an user queries to find impacts of mutations on an enzyme's stability and functionality, information relevant to that specific enzyme can be retrieved from the system and displayed on the web .
testing
in order to measure the performance of enzyminer, the system was employed with the query enzymes ""lipase"" and ""amylase"".
these two enzymes perform essential roles in human digestion system, and deficiency of these enzymes may lead to disorders in human body.
moreover, they have many applications in chemical and food industry.
therefore, it is easy to find both disease related and non-disease related abstracts that contain one of queried enzymes.
as indicated before, possible variations of the term ""mutation"" was included into our search query while developing the enzyminer system.
however, in the evaluation step, only the pubmed abstracts that contain the terms ""mutation"" or ""mutations"", and either one of the queried enzymes were downloaded.
as a result, our experimental dataset showed  <dig> abstracts that contain the term ""lipase"" and  <dig> abstracts showed the term ""amylase"".
all of the abstracts are manually curated by the experts for three classification schemes.
the impact analysis stage of enzyminer consists of  <dig> classification modules:  disease vs. non-disease classification,  change vs. no change classification, and  stability vs. catalytic classification modules.
before detailing the experiments performed at this stage, stating the classification algorithms and evaluation metrics used in these modules will provide better understanding of the evaluation.
classification algorithms and processing options
in the classification stages of enzyminer, rainbow  <cit>  was used for document classification.
it provides several classification algorithms and processing options.
in order to decide which classification algorithm was more suitable, the classification performances of four algorithms  were investigated.
moreover, since some of these algorithms adopt the bag-of-words approach, eight different processing models were built to observe the impact of tokenization, stemming, and the use of n-grams.
in these eight models, the effect of stemming, removing commonly observed morphological and inflectional suffixes from words, and the effect of using unigrams and bigrams were tested.
in addition, to observe the effect of tokenization, two types of procedures were used, these are, white space tokenizer and alphanumeric tokenizer.
the white space tokenizer delimits the tokens by a whitespace only, while the alphanumeric tokenizer delimits the tokens by only nonalphanumeric characters  <cit> .
evaluation in the classification modules
as stated before, systematic evaluations for mutation extraction systems are developed with a precise definition of evaluation metrics.
although not many systems still analyze the impact of mutations, evaluation metrics for such systems were also defined.
since, the general idea for impact analysis is to perform information extraction, the standard precision, recall and f-measure are ideal parameters for evaluation  <cit> .
we decided to use also the accuracy measure in our evaluations because we approached to this problem as a document classification problem.
furthermore, in order to test the effectiveness of the classification modules, we followed the train-and-test and k-fold cross validation approaches together.
for each classification module, 20% of the abstracts were chosen as a test set.
the remaining abstracts were used as a training set and the models are trained only with these abstracts.
first of all, using only the training set,  <dig> fold classification was performed fifty times and the average accuracy was represented as the training set accuracy.
this step was repeated for all four classification algorithms and eight models.
the classification algorithm with the highest accuracy model was used in the test step, where the abstracts from the test set were queried for classification.
the overall accuracy of this step was represented as the test set accuracy.
RESULTS
mutation extraction stage
in order to measure the performance of mutation extraction stage, all of the downloaded abstracts that contained the enzyme ""lipase"" or ""amylase"" were queried to mutation extraction and disambiguation modules of mugex.
out of  <dig> abstracts,  <dig> were identified to have containing the amino-acid-level mutation with  <dig> % precision,  <dig> % recall,  <dig>  f-measure and  <dig> % accuracy.
these  <dig> abstracts were then used to evaluate the impact analysis stage, where 80% of them were used as training set and the remaining as the test set.
the number of abstracts in the training and test set for each classification module can be found in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>
impact analysis stage
as indicated previously, performances of naive bayes, svm, probabilistic indexing and rocchio with tf-idf weighting classification algorithms were investigated.
the experimental runs showed that, out of four classification algorithms, probabilistic indexing always performed better than the other three algorithms.
as shown in figure  <dig>  the accuracy measures of the four algorithms were compared with respect to the training set accuracies of stability vs. catalytic classification module.
probabilistic indexing outperformed the other algorithms, while rocchio with tf-idf weighting performs moderately better than naive bayes.
although svm is one of the best classification algorithms in document classification, its' performance is dependent on the context of the document  <cit> .
in this application context, out of the four classification algorithms, svm was the one with the worst performance measure.
the same order was observed in the other classification modules and therefore, probabilistic indexing was chosen for all of the classification tasks performed in the impact analysis stage.
as in the disease vs. non-disease classification module, downloaded abstracts that contained at least one protein mutation were classified as disease related or non-disease related abstracts.
in our experimental data,  <dig> abstracts that contained amino-acid-level mutation were randomly divided into training and test sets, and  <dig> fold classification was performed fifty times on the training set.
as seen in figure  <dig>  the highest training set accuracy measure of 95% was obtained using model  <dig>  with  <dig>  f-measure.
this high accuracy is expected since most of the disease related abstracts contained words such as ""disease"", ""patient"", ""deficiency"" or ""subject"", and increasing the frequency of these words by performing stemming also increases our accuracy.
moreover, word pairs such as ""binding site"" and ""substrate specificity"" are terms related to the activity of an enzyme and they were mostly observed in abstracts that are not disease related.
therefore, using bi-grams also increased our classification accuracy.
after the experiments from the training set, all the abstracts in the test set were classified using probabilistic indexing algorithm which was trained with the above model.
at the end of the classification, 100% of the abstracts were correctly classified .
after the disease vs. non-disease classification, if the user specifically indicates an interest in a disease related abstract, the abstracts that are assigned to this class are displayed on the web with a list of protein mutations they contain.
if we specifically look at the mutation extraction performance on these abstracts, our accuracy was  <dig> % with  <dig> % precision,  <dig> % recall and  <dig>  f-measure.
on the other hand, if the user is not interested in a disease related abstract, the abstracts that are assigned to the non-disease related class were then continued to be processed in change vs. no change classification module.
in this module, another classification identifies the abstracts that do not contain any change in the enzyme's stability or functionality.
as shown in figure  <dig>  the highest classification accuracy of the training set was obtained using model  <dig>  with  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  f-measure, and the results of this experiment are given in table  <dig>  using this model,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  f-measure were obtained in the classification of the test set and at the end of this step, abstracts that were classified as no change are eliminated.
in the last step, the remaining abstracts are classified into two groups, these are, abstracts that contain information on a change in the enzyme's stability, or abstracts that discuss the changes in the enzyme's catalytic activity.
when this classification was performed on the training set, the highest accuracy measure  <dig> % and  <dig>  f-measure were observed with model  <dig> , and thus a classification was performed on the test set using this model.
at the end, it was observed that all the abstracts in the test set were correctly classified.
as illustrated in table  <dig>  the experimental results of both the training and test sets are shown to be very high, which is expected since the classification model successfully identifies the most informative words such as ""thermostability"", ""ph"", ""temperature"", ""sensitivity"" and ""specificity"" as well as increase their frequency with stemming.
it has been observed that classification modules respond to the different processing options in a more or less similar way.
however, highest training set accuracies were observed in different models for each classification module.
it shows that processing options have different effects on the classification of different concept.
the only common part of these three models was stemming, which is an expected result, since it reduces the dimensionality of the term space which is a good thing for systems that have small training sets  <cit>  such as enzyminer.
as indicated before, our experimental runs were performed on the abstracts that are obtained using the words ""lipase"" and ""amylase"".
all three classification modules were first trained with abstracts that contain ""lipase"", and tested with abstracts that contain ""amylase"" later.
this was performed in order to prove that the success of enzyminer was not dependent on the inclusion of the query enzyme abstracts in the training set.
in our test set we had  <dig> abstracts that contain a protein mutation and the term ""amylase"".
out of these  <dig> abstracts,  <dig> of them were non-disease related, out of these  <dig> non-disease related abstracts,  <dig> of them contained a change in the enzyme's stability or functionality.
the results of these experiments as shown in table  <dig> indicate that training enzyminer on lipases provided necessary information to correctly classify the amylases.
this proves that training our system with only one enzyme is sufficient to obtain high classification accuracies for the other enzymes, which is the intended use of enzyminer.
CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we described enzyminer, an automated system designed to identify the pubmed abstracts that contain information on the impact of a protein level mutation on the stability and the activity of a given enzyme.
to our knowledge, besides the manually curated enzyme database brenda, there is no tool or database that provides the same information like the enzyminer.
although, we performed our experiments on lipases and amylases, the enzyminer can be applied to other enzymes without any modification.
for mutation extraction, we used mugex which handles ambiguous mutation citations successfully, and thus has a high accuracy and f-measure.
in the case of impact analysis of mutations, enzyminer uses document classification first to separate disease related abstracts, then to eliminate abstracts that do not contain any change in enzyme's stability or catalytic activity, and lastly to classify the remaining abstracts according to the impact of the mutation on the stability or on the catalytic activity.
currently, enzyminer does not give any information about the direction of the impact, whether there is an increase or decrease in the stability conditions or catalytic activity.
such a specification cannot be handled as a classification problem because there are abstracts that contain several mutations, each effect the stability condition or catalytic activity of an enzyme in different directions.
moreover, enzyminer does not specify the kind of change in the stability conditions.
it cannot distinguish between the changes in ph and temperature values.
similarly, in case of functionality, it cannot differentiate a change in the enzyme's specificity from a change in the sensitivity.
another limitation of enzyminer is, if an abstract contains several enzymes and protein mutations, it cannot associate the enzymes to the corresponding mutations, since enzyminer do not use proximity measures.
therefore, in the future, natural language processing techniques should be employed in order to overcome the above limitations and extract more specific information about the impact of a mutation on an enzyme.

",763,"BACKGROUND
enzymes are mostly protein based biomolecules that accelerate the rate of chemical reactions in a living organism. enzymes are made of amino acids whose unique characteristic composition enables them to have different functionalities and also making them work efficiently at stable conditions, such as optimum temperature and ph. thus, any mutation that occurs in this amino acid sequence may change the enzyme's 3d-structure, catalytic activity or stability, or even making the enzyme completely non-functional. therefore, the knowledge of mutations and their impacts are of crucial importance in order to completely understand mechanisms of enzymes' functionality, and stability.

many experimental studies have focused on finding the effects of mutations on enzymes. for example, many studies have aimed to create enzymes with novel properties such as designing hyperthermophilic enzymes  <cit>  or expanding the substrate specificity of an enzyme  <cit> . the published results of these projects provide scientific information for researchers who are engaged in finding an impact of mutation on an enzyme. though many databases are available on the nomenclature of enzymes  <cit>  or structure and function  <cit> , to our knowledge only brenda   <cit> , the largest manually curated enzyme-specific information system, contains an information on engineered enzymes and their effects on the enzyme's catalytic activity while directly referring to scientific literature. manually curated databases are both slow and expensive for extracting information from scientific literature. there is a need for an efficient automatic extraction method that allows accessing relevant information rapidly with great efficiency, and possibly at any time.

with the latest developments in information extraction, biomedical term recognition has become an important area for researchers. dictionary-based, rule-based, and machine learning-based approaches are used to extract names of genes, proteins and other cellular substances  <cit> . several systems have already been developed for automatic extractions of mutations from biomedical literature. mutext, for example, developed by horn et al.  <cit>  is one of the initial works that focused on extracting single point mutations from scientific literature. moreover, a gold standard data set  <cit>  is created for comparing the performance of mutation extraction systems and systematic evaluations  <cit>  for these systems are developed with a precise definition of evaluation metrics. the next step in mutation informatics is finding relation of mutations to other biological entities such as genes or proteins.

rebholz-schuhmann et al.  <cit>  developed mema, which extracts disease-related mutation-gene pairs from medline abstracts. in mema, identification of both gene names and mutations are based on regular expressions compiled into two different finite state automations. if the abstract or the sentence that the mutation is extracted from contains only one gene name, the detected mutation is associated to that particular gene. however, if there is more than one gene name, the mema uses syntactical rules and proximity parameters as a criterion for decision. mugex  uses a similar approach developed by erdogmus et al.  <cit>  in order to extract disease related protein mutations. mugex makes use of regular expressions in identifying possible mutations. however, it also handles ambiguous mutation citations by using machine learning techniques. for gene name identification, it uses a dictionary-based approach and then associates the extracted entities according to proximity measures.

for mutation-protein associations, lee et al.  <cit>  developed mutation grab, which identifies mutations using regular expressions, similar to the previous methods  <cit> . protein identification is also performed with regular expressions, which search for a dictionary of protein names and synonyms. lastly, mutation grab uses graphs in which shortest-distance search and word bigram analysis are used in order to find the associations between mutations and proteins. mutationminer which is developed by baker et al.  <cit>  follows a different approach than the previous systems. it mainly focuses on associations between mutations and protein structure visualizations using nlp techniques. the system identifies the proteins and mutations in the form of name entities and if cited in the same sentence, the mutationminer associates them to one another. moreover, this system has been improved of late with the support of biological ontologies which make mutation annotations available in a semantically consistent format, and with the owl ontology which enables the automated means of accessing knowledge possible  <cit> .

the above information extraction techniques became necessary because of the increased number of electronic documents. at the same time, however, the task to classify these documents based on their contents makes document classification an important field for researchers. especially after integrating machine learning techniques to document classification, its accuracy has now became comparable to the less than 100% accuracy of human expertise  <cit> . therefore, because of growing interest and high accuracy rates, document classification has been used in different applications such as document organization  <cit> , word sense disambiguation  <cit>  or web document classification  <cit> .

although the above works make it possible to associate mutations to other biological entities, the experimental results documented in scientific literature cannot be extracted with the techniques discussed above. therefore, in case of mutation informatics, the next step is to extract information describing the effects of the mutations  <cit> . the writers of this paper developed enzyminer, which is capable of automatically extracting protein mutations from pubmed  <cit>  abstracts for a given enzyme and classifying their impact on the enzyme's functionality and stability. in the case of mutation identification, the information extraction and document classification methods are used. for impact analysis, document classification techniques are again used for identifying the abstracts that contain a change in the stability conditions or catalytic activity of an enzyme resulted from a mutation.

methods
algorithm
mutation extraction
in this work, we focus on amino acid level protein mutations. in order to extract this kind of mutation from pubmed abstracts, we used mugex  <cit> 's mutation extraction and disambiguation modules which are based on regular expressions and machine learning techniques. a set of  <dig> patterns was formed using phrases that contain protein mutations for regular expression matching in mugex. next, pattern matching was applied to each sentence of the abstracts in order to identify mutations.

one major drawback of using regular expressions is that they are too general to be able to capture only the protein level mutations. a nucleotide mutation such as g32a, or the name of a strain or a cell line, such as h4s may easily be misinterpreted as a protein mutation. in order to eliminate such ambiguities, mugex makes use of machine learning techniques. document classification on topic and content sections of these abstracts identifies them as to whether or not a protein mutation is present.

seperating disease related abstracts
enzymes are essential for a number of functions in the cell; therefore, any malfunctioning of an enzyme caused by a mutation may be found in relation to a disease. thus, many research projects are conducted to find the relation between enzyme mutations and diseases. since, medline is the largest component of pubmed, all the abstracts of these medical projects are included in the pubmed database. therefore, when we download all the abstracts that contain the term ""mutation"" and a specific enzyme name, the medical abstracts are also accompanied in the downloaded information. however, these abstracts contains the general focus on the mutations' effects on the disease development, but not on the functionality or the stability of enzymes. for instance, lipoprotein lipase hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins. mutations in the gene encoding for lipoprotein lipase can lead to lipoprotein lipase deficiency that in turn leads to an increase in the levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream. therefore, many abstracts that contain both the words ""mutation"" and ""lipase"" are about research aiming to find the specific mutations that cause this disease. similarly, the disease related abstracts do not contain the information on direct impact of the mutation on the enzyme functionality or stability. for that reason, including these abstracts into our classification will mislead our results. in order to prevent corruption of the data, we initially classify the abstracts into two groups:  disease related abstracts and  non-disease related abstracts. dictionary based approaches  <cit>  that make use of medical subject headings  or unified medical language system  are previously used for identifying disease related abstracts. on the other hand, various document classification algorithms are also employed for clinical text classification between disease related documents such as clinical patient records  <cit> . in enzyminer, we used document classification approach for grouping our abstracts into disease related or non-disease related abstracts. therefore, user is giving the option of choosing disease related or non-disease related abstracts, and base of their selection a list of mutations and their impacts on the enzyme are displayed on the web with direct references to the relevant scientific literature.

impacts of mutation
enzymatic reaction rates depend on physico-chemical conditions, such as ph and temperature. when these conditions are optimum, the enzyme attains its maximal activity. however, at high temperatures or extreme ph changes, the enzyme may become inactive as a result of denaturation. stability is the condition in which an enzyme can maintain its structural conformation and activity, yet, a mutation may cause changes in these conditions. for instance, a mutation that decreases the molecular flexibility of an enzyme sometimes may lead to higher thermostability, or a mutation that replaces glycine with a basic or acidic residue may cause significant changes in the enzyme's optimum ph. therefore, to understand the governing rules of protein structure stability, researchers carry out mutation studies and check the impact on stability at different temperatures and ph.

likewise, an enzyme's functionality is also affected by mutations. unlike most of the chemical catalysts, enzymes are highly selective to their substrates and this specificity is mainly determined by three dimensional coordinates of the active site. therefore, a mutation that modifies the conformation of an enzyme, especially the catalytic site, may cease its function. a mutation that changes the spatial coordinates of the active site can change enzyme specificity for a specific molecule. on the other hand, all the mutations may not necessarily have a significant effect on the enzyme's stability conditions or catalytic functions. there are experimental results, for example, which show that some mutations have no impact. the abstracts that include only these kinds of mutations have to be filtered out since our main purpose is to find the abstracts that contain impacts of mutations on enzymes. we represented this challenge as a classification problem and removed the abstracts that are classified as no change abstracts from our data set.

system architecture
the system architecture of enzyminer is shown in figure  <dig>  our system is composed of three stages:  preprocessing,  mutation extraction and  impact analysis. in this work, we focused on the abstracts from pubmed. abstracts published after january  <dig>   <dig>  which contain an enzyme and the possible variations of the term ""mutation"" are downloaded. in order to include possible variations of ""mutation"" into our search query, a truncated form of word ""mutation"" was used. in the case of enzymes, we only used the trivial names in our search queries that supposedly used by all researchers. further, including ec numbers to our search seems unnecessary since in the abstracts ec numbers are rarely used as the extra information near the enzymes' common names. since our initial aim was to identify pubmed articles that are focused on a specific enzyme and possible protein mutations, we performed our search restricted to only the 'title' and the 'abstract' sections. if the searched words are not found in the abstract but found in the other fields, such pubmed entry was not downloaded.

while in the preprocessing stage, the downloaded pubmed abstracts are first parsed, and then tokenization followed by sentence splitting operations were performed on these parsed abstracts for the successive stages.

as for as the mutation extraction stage is concerned, we used mugex  <cit>  which is developed by our group to extract disease related mutation-gene pairs. mugex consists of two stages and each stage has several modules. since this work requires us to identify only protein mutations, we therefore used mutation extraction and disambiguation modules of mugex. mutation extraction module makes use of pattern matching with regular expressions to find the possible protein mutations from the text. all of the regular expressions are based on one pattern that starts with an amino acid as the one letter code followed by a number, and ends with another amino acid as another one letter code . by making modification to this pattern, a set of  <dig> patterns was formed in order to find remaining mutation patterns.

regular expressions are able to identify protein mutations. however, as indicated previously, the main challenge in amino-acid-level mutation extraction is to distinguish actual protein mutations from nucleotide mutations, or mutation like terms such as the name of a strain or a cell line. disambiguation module of mugex eliminates these kinds of ambiguities by using document classification as a word sense disambiguation application. this module uses rainbow  <cit> , one of the front ends of the bow library designed for document classification, so as to decide the abstracts that contain potentially ambiguous mutations. a training benchmark that consists of  <dig>  randomly selected medline abstracts is formed and all of these abstracts were labeled by experts. out of these, a total of  <dig> abstracts contained protein mutations while the remaining abstracts contain either nucleotide mutations or biological entities that are cited with mutation-like terms. using these labeled abstracts, the disambiguation module trains a model for classification while processing the abstracts by performing stemming, alphanumeric tokenization and considering word bigrams.

after the preprocessing stage, enzyminer identifies all possible protein mutations in the downloaded abstracts using the mutation extraction module. then the ambiguous abstracts are queried to the disambiguation module where they are classified using naive bayes algorithm, which is trained with the above model. at the end of this stage, abstracts that contain protein mutations are queried to the classification modules of the impact analysis stage for further classification.

impact analysis stage consists of three classification modules. firstly, the disease vs. non-disease classification module separates abstracts into two groups. if the user is interested only in disease related abstracts, the abstracts that are classified as disease related are displayed on the web with a list of protein mutations. on the other hand, non-disease related abstracts are queried to change vs. no change classification module and the ones that do not contain any change in an enzyme's functionality or stability are eliminated. lastly, in the stability vs. catalytic classification module, the remaining abstracts were sub-classified into two groups: ones that contain a change in stability of the protein structure, for those involved in catalytic activity as shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig> 

in all the classification modules of the impact analysis stage, rainbow was used as a document classifier. it assigns a document to the class with the highest score. however, the scores of the other classes are also given in the results. in the classification modules such as disease vs. not disease classification and change vs. no change, the abstracts in the test set are assigned to the class with the highest classification score. on the other hand, for the stability vs. catalytic classification module, before assigning an abstract to one of the classes, the difference between the scores of the two classes was checked. if the difference is less than  <dig> , such abstract was assigned to both classes, because an abstract may contain a change in both the stability as well as the catalytic activity. furthermore, it is to be noted that in the classification modules, all possible words from the vocabulary are adapted as a feature during the classification.

implementation
all the steps at the preprocessing stage are developed using flex  <cit>  and bison  <cit> . in the mutation extraction module, all regular expressions were compiled with the help of a c++ regular expression library. the disambiguation module makes use of rainbow  <cit>  in order to identify the abstracts that contain potentially ambiguous mutations. similarly, rainbow was used as a document classifier in all the classification modules of the impact analysis stage.

during the steps shown in the figure  <dig>  all necessary information for the downloaded abstracts are inserted into a database. whenever an user queries to find impacts of mutations on an enzyme's stability and functionality, information relevant to that specific enzyme can be retrieved from the system and displayed on the web .

testing
in order to measure the performance of enzyminer, the system was employed with the query enzymes ""lipase"" and ""amylase"". these two enzymes perform essential roles in human digestion system, and deficiency of these enzymes may lead to disorders in human body. moreover, they have many applications in chemical and food industry. therefore, it is easy to find both disease related and non-disease related abstracts that contain one of queried enzymes. as indicated before, possible variations of the term ""mutation"" was included into our search query while developing the enzyminer system. however, in the evaluation step, only the pubmed abstracts that contain the terms ""mutation"" or ""mutations"", and either one of the queried enzymes were downloaded. as a result, our experimental dataset showed  <dig> abstracts that contain the term ""lipase"" and  <dig> abstracts showed the term ""amylase"". all of the abstracts are manually curated by the experts for three classification schemes.

the impact analysis stage of enzyminer consists of  <dig> classification modules:  disease vs. non-disease classification,  change vs. no change classification, and  stability vs. catalytic classification modules. before detailing the experiments performed at this stage, stating the classification algorithms and evaluation metrics used in these modules will provide better understanding of the evaluation.

classification algorithms and processing options
in the classification stages of enzyminer, rainbow  <cit>  was used for document classification. it provides several classification algorithms and processing options. in order to decide which classification algorithm was more suitable, the classification performances of four algorithms  were investigated. moreover, since some of these algorithms adopt the bag-of-words approach, eight different processing models were built to observe the impact of tokenization, stemming, and the use of n-grams. in these eight models, the effect of stemming, removing commonly observed morphological and inflectional suffixes from words, and the effect of using unigrams and bigrams were tested. in addition, to observe the effect of tokenization, two types of procedures were used, these are, white space tokenizer and alphanumeric tokenizer. the white space tokenizer delimits the tokens by a whitespace only, while the alphanumeric tokenizer delimits the tokens by only nonalphanumeric characters  <cit> .

evaluation in the classification modules
as stated before, systematic evaluations for mutation extraction systems are developed with a precise definition of evaluation metrics. although not many systems still analyze the impact of mutations, evaluation metrics for such systems were also defined. since, the general idea for impact analysis is to perform information extraction, the standard precision, recall and f-measure are ideal parameters for evaluation  <cit> . we decided to use also the accuracy measure in our evaluations because we approached to this problem as a document classification problem.

furthermore, in order to test the effectiveness of the classification modules, we followed the train-and-test and k-fold cross validation approaches together. for each classification module, 20% of the abstracts were chosen as a test set. the remaining abstracts were used as a training set and the models are trained only with these abstracts. first of all, using only the training set,  <dig> fold classification was performed fifty times and the average accuracy was represented as the training set accuracy. this step was repeated for all four classification algorithms and eight models. the classification algorithm with the highest accuracy model was used in the test step, where the abstracts from the test set were queried for classification. the overall accuracy of this step was represented as the test set accuracy.

RESULTS
mutation extraction stage
in order to measure the performance of mutation extraction stage, all of the downloaded abstracts that contained the enzyme ""lipase"" or ""amylase"" were queried to mutation extraction and disambiguation modules of mugex. out of  <dig> abstracts,  <dig> were identified to have containing the amino-acid-level mutation with  <dig> % precision,  <dig> % recall,  <dig>  f-measure and  <dig> % accuracy. these  <dig> abstracts were then used to evaluate the impact analysis stage, where 80% of them were used as training set and the remaining as the test set. the number of abstracts in the training and test set for each classification module can be found in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> 

impact analysis stage
as indicated previously, performances of naive bayes, svm, probabilistic indexing and rocchio with tf-idf weighting classification algorithms were investigated. the experimental runs showed that, out of four classification algorithms, probabilistic indexing always performed better than the other three algorithms. as shown in figure  <dig>  the accuracy measures of the four algorithms were compared with respect to the training set accuracies of stability vs. catalytic classification module. probabilistic indexing outperformed the other algorithms, while rocchio with tf-idf weighting performs moderately better than naive bayes. although svm is one of the best classification algorithms in document classification, its' performance is dependent on the context of the document  <cit> . in this application context, out of the four classification algorithms, svm was the one with the worst performance measure. the same order was observed in the other classification modules and therefore, probabilistic indexing was chosen for all of the classification tasks performed in the impact analysis stage.

as in the disease vs. non-disease classification module, downloaded abstracts that contained at least one protein mutation were classified as disease related or non-disease related abstracts. in our experimental data,  <dig> abstracts that contained amino-acid-level mutation were randomly divided into training and test sets, and  <dig> fold classification was performed fifty times on the training set. as seen in figure  <dig>  the highest training set accuracy measure of 95% was obtained using model  <dig>  with  <dig>  f-measure. this high accuracy is expected since most of the disease related abstracts contained words such as ""disease"", ""patient"", ""deficiency"" or ""subject"", and increasing the frequency of these words by performing stemming also increases our accuracy. moreover, word pairs such as ""binding site"" and ""substrate specificity"" are terms related to the activity of an enzyme and they were mostly observed in abstracts that are not disease related. therefore, using bi-grams also increased our classification accuracy. after the experiments from the training set, all the abstracts in the test set were classified using probabilistic indexing algorithm which was trained with the above model. at the end of the classification, 100% of the abstracts were correctly classified .

after the disease vs. non-disease classification, if the user specifically indicates an interest in a disease related abstract, the abstracts that are assigned to this class are displayed on the web with a list of protein mutations they contain. if we specifically look at the mutation extraction performance on these abstracts, our accuracy was  <dig> % with  <dig> % precision,  <dig> % recall and  <dig>  f-measure. on the other hand, if the user is not interested in a disease related abstract, the abstracts that are assigned to the non-disease related class were then continued to be processed in change vs. no change classification module.

in this module, another classification identifies the abstracts that do not contain any change in the enzyme's stability or functionality. as shown in figure  <dig>  the highest classification accuracy of the training set was obtained using model  <dig>  with  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  f-measure, and the results of this experiment are given in table  <dig>  using this model,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  f-measure were obtained in the classification of the test set and at the end of this step, abstracts that were classified as no change are eliminated.

in the last step, the remaining abstracts are classified into two groups, these are, abstracts that contain information on a change in the enzyme's stability, or abstracts that discuss the changes in the enzyme's catalytic activity. when this classification was performed on the training set, the highest accuracy measure  <dig> % and  <dig>  f-measure were observed with model  <dig> , and thus a classification was performed on the test set using this model. at the end, it was observed that all the abstracts in the test set were correctly classified. as illustrated in table  <dig>  the experimental results of both the training and test sets are shown to be very high, which is expected since the classification model successfully identifies the most informative words such as ""thermostability"", ""ph"", ""temperature"", ""sensitivity"" and ""specificity"" as well as increase their frequency with stemming.

it has been observed that classification modules respond to the different processing options in a more or less similar way. however, highest training set accuracies were observed in different models for each classification module. it shows that processing options have different effects on the classification of different concept. the only common part of these three models was stemming, which is an expected result, since it reduces the dimensionality of the term space which is a good thing for systems that have small training sets  <cit>  such as enzyminer.

as indicated before, our experimental runs were performed on the abstracts that are obtained using the words ""lipase"" and ""amylase"". all three classification modules were first trained with abstracts that contain ""lipase"", and tested with abstracts that contain ""amylase"" later. this was performed in order to prove that the success of enzyminer was not dependent on the inclusion of the query enzyme abstracts in the training set. in our test set we had  <dig> abstracts that contain a protein mutation and the term ""amylase"". out of these  <dig> abstracts,  <dig> of them were non-disease related, out of these  <dig> non-disease related abstracts,  <dig> of them contained a change in the enzyme's stability or functionality. the results of these experiments as shown in table  <dig> indicate that training enzyminer on lipases provided necessary information to correctly classify the amylases. this proves that training our system with only one enzyme is sufficient to obtain high classification accuracies for the other enzymes, which is the intended use of enzyminer.

","BACKGROUND
a better understanding of the mechanisms of an enzyme's functionality and stability, as well as knowledge and impact of mutations is crucial for researchers working with enzymes. though, several of the enzymes' databases are currently available, scientific literature still remains at large for up-to-date source of learning the effects of a mutation on an enzyme. however, going through vast amounts of scientific documents to extract the information on desired mutation has always been a time consuming process. in this paper, therefore, we describe an unique method, termed as enzyminer, which automatically identifies the pubmed abstracts that contain information on the impact of a protein level mutation on the stability and/or the activity of a given enzyme.

CONCLUSIONS
enzyminer identifies the abstracts that contain a protein mutation for a given enzyme and checks whether the abstract is related to a disease with the help of information extraction and machine learning techniques. for disease related abstracts, the mutation list and direct links to the abstracts are retrieved from the system and displayed on the web. for those abstracts that are related to non-diseases, in addition to having the mutation list, the abstracts are also categorized into two groups. these two groups determine whether the mutation has an effect on the enzyme's stability or functionality followed by displaying these on the web.

"BACKGROUND
symbiotic associations between bacteria and insects are widespread in nature, being postulated as one of the key factors of their evolutionary success.
bacterial endosymbionts allow insects to colonize novel ecological niches characterized by unbalanced nutritional sources which would be unavailable without their assistance  <cit> .
based on the evolutionary age of the symbiotic association and the extent of codependence between both symbiotic partners, bacterial endosymbionts are classified into primary and secondary.
the former are generally essential for their hosts, reside exclusively inside specialized host cells called bacteriocytes, are transmitted by strict vertical transmission from mother to descendents and the associations with their insect hosts are usually ancient.
on the other hand, secondary endosymbionts have been more recently acquired by their insect hosts, they are not strictly necessary for host survival, possess a wider tissue tropism, being found both intracellularly and extracellularly in different host tissues and, although mainly transmitted by vertical inheritance, may occasionally be transmitted horizontally, even between species  <cit> .
evolutionary symbiotic associations between bacteria and insects, especially when they become obligate intracellular mutualists, have led to several common genomic features  <cit> .
many nonessential genes are inactivated and their dna is lost in a stepwise process including many small and some large indel mutations  <cit> .
the gradual process leads to very small genome sizes, such as those of the aphid endosymbiont buchnera aphidicola  <cit> , the ant endosymbiont blochmannia  <cit> , or the psyllid endosymbiont carsonella rudii  <cit> .
drastically reduced genomes contain gene repertoires with very few, if any, presence of mobile genetic elements and encode highly streamlined metabolisms.
sequence evolution is especially distinctive with fast nucleotide substitution rates, specially for nonsynonymous substitutions  <cit> , a strong nucleotide compositional bias toward the increase in a+t, a drastic change in the amino acid composition of proteins and an almost complete loss of the bias of codon usage, which may discriminate between high and low expressing genes  <cit> .
gene order stability is another important characteristic of many of these endosymbionts, because almost none genome rearrangement or horizontal gene transfer event is detected  <cit> .
the absence of genome flux from other sources may be due to both the restricted intracellular environment and the inability to incorporate foreign dna by recombination  <cit> .
the strict vertical transmission from mothers to descendents leads to the coevolution between the bacterial endosymbionts and their hosts  <cit> .
by contrast, the genomes of facultative secondary endosymbionts that have established recent associations with their hosts show heterogeneous genomic features.
in some cases, such as sequence evolution, they show intermediate characteristics between free living and obligate endosymbionts  <cit> , while in other cases they already maintain some typical characteristics of free-living species.
in recent associations, genome sizes are similar to those of free-living relatives, with very few, if any, compositional bias, higher loads of mobile genetic elements , and an increased amount of non-functional dna, allowing to study the main evolutionary forces acting during this initial stages of the genome reduction process.
sodalis glossinidius is the facultative secondary endosymbiont of the tsetse fly , where it is harboured both intracellularly and extracellularly in different tissues including the midgut, haemolymph, fat body, or milk-gland  <cit> .
tsetse flies harbour other two bacterial endosymbionts, the obligatory mutualist wigglesworthia glossinidia, that resides intracellularly inside bacteriocytes, cells that forms the bacteriome organ in the anterior midgut  <cit> , and the parasitic wolbachia, that is localized in ovarian tissues  <cit> .
the genome of w. glossinidia was sequenced in  <dig>  <cit> , and shows the typical features of an ancient obligatory primary endosymbiont, with a highly streamlined chromosome  with 22% gc content and  <dig> protein coding genes .
it has retained most genes for cofactor biosynthesis, which is claimed as the main reason for this symbiotic association since endosymbionts may supply the tsetse host with vitamins, which are absent in the vertebrate blood.
by contrast, the genome sequence of s. glossinidius  <cit>  revealed genomic features closer to free-living γ-proteobacteria like escherichia coli than to obligatory mutualists, with a genome size of  <dig>  mb and  <dig> % gc content.
its main feature was the detection that close to one fourth of cdss were inactive , indicative of a massive process of gene inactivation, which has also been described in other bacterial association, such as the one of the pathogenic bacteria mycobacterium leprae  <cit> .
the absence of coevolution between s. glossinidius and tsetse flies and the fact that s. glossinidius is the only bacterial endosymbiont that is able to be cultured in vitro reveals a very recent symbiotic association with the tsetse host  <cit> , providing an ideal system to study the initial steps of the transition from free-living to a host-dependent lifestyle.
we present a complete re-annotation and re-analysis of the genome of s. glossinidius str.
morsitans centered in three main aspects.
first, the detailed characterization of pseudogenes at both nucleotide and amino acid levels, second, characterization of the different types of insertion sequence  and prophage elements present in the genome and the assessment of their role in the gene inactivation process, and third, the detailed analysis of the metabolic system comprised by s. glossinidius and w. glossinidia in order to evaluate the impact of gene inactivation over metabolic capabilities of s. glossinidius and the extent of metabolic complementation between both symbionts in the context of the symbiotic association with the tsetse flies.
methods
pseudogene annotation
the genome and coding sequences of s. glossinidius  were extracted from genbank .
pseudogene boundaries were characterized by a two-step approach.
in a first step, intergenic regions between non-overlapping genes with a minimum length of  <dig> base pairs  were used as query sequences against escherichia coli strain k <dig> substrain mg <dig> proteome  using blastx  <cit>  with a maximum e-value cutoff of 10- <dig>  extracting the segments covering each blastx hit in s. glossinidius genome.
potential pseudogenes covering at least 25% of encoded protein length were retained, rendering a preliminary set of  <dig> potential pseudogenes.
in a second step, new intergenic regions were extracted this time considering originally annotated genes and previously identified pseudogenes and those with a minimum length of  <dig> base pairs  were used as query sequences against proteomes of all completely sequenced bacterial genomes in kegg database  <cit>  at december of  <dig> using blastx with a maximum e-value cutoff of 10- <dig>  this analysis produced a second preliminary set of  <dig> potential pseudogenes.
finally, genewise program  <cit>  was used to predict the open reading frames of each potential pseudogene based on the protein sequence of their best blastx hit, and this information was integrated with artemis software release  <dig>  <cit>  joining open reading frames of the same pseudogene.
insertion sequence element characterization
to characterize the major types of is elements of s. glossinidius, its genome sequence was self-compared using nucmer program from mummer package  <cit>  with default conditions.
four main blocks of highly conserved repeated sequences with a minimum sequence length of  <dig> bp were identified.
they included  <dig> out of  <dig> originally annotated transposase genes.
in order to cover the complete is length, repeated sequences of each type  plus  <dig> bp flanking regions were extracted .
sequences were aligned with clustalw program  <cit> .
inverted repeats were identified with the programs palindrome and etandem included in the emboss package  <cit> .
direct repeats flanking each is element were identified by visual inspection of nucleotide sequences.
consensus sequences for each alignment were extracted with consense program included in the emboss package.
more divergent or partial copies of each is element were identified using the consensus sequences as queries in blastn searches against s. glossinidius genome.
finally, in order to characterize minor is elements not detected by the previous approach, the remaining genome sequences were used as query sequence against is finder database  <cit>  using blastx with an e-value cutoff of 10- <dig>  detecting a fifth group of is elements  that was characterized by the same procedure described above.
genes disrupted by is element insertion events were identified by blastx using the two sequences flanking each is element as queries against non-redundant protein database subdivision of genbank  <cit>  with an e-value cutoff of  <dig> - <dig>
for each type of is element, complete and partial is copies were aligned with clustalw.
the p-distance between copies of the same type of element  were estimated with the pairwise deletion option in mega <dig> software package  <cit> , and the segment of the multiple alignment corresponding to each transposase gene was extracted and translated.
elements with stop codons or frameshifts in the region corresponding to the transposase gene were considered as defective, whereas, in absence of any further information, substitutions rendering amino acid changes or small indels multiples of three nucleotides were considered to yield functional products.
whole genome functional reannotation
manual re-annotation of all originally annotated protein coding genes and potential pseudogenes was carried out integrating different sources of information.
hierarchical functional classification scheme adopted from the sanger institute, that is derived from the more general multifun classification scheme of gene products  <cit> , was used to assign a ""class"" qualifier to each cds reflecting their cellular function.
the annotation of e. coli k <dig> genome was adopted as reference given its close evolutionary relationship with s. glossinidius and the precision of its annotation, recently updated by an international consortium  <cit> .
orthology between s. glossinidius and e. coli k <dig> protein coding genes was proposed based on reciprocal-best-match fasta searches  <cit>  with cutoffs of 80% of alignment length and 30% of amino acid identity.
the annotation from e. coli k <dig> was transferred to the putative s. glossinidius ortholog including qualifiers ""product"", ""ec number"", ""class"", ""gene"" ""function"" and ""note"".
reciprocal-best-match fasta searches were also carried out between s. glossinidius genome and hamap database of manually annotated microbial proteomes  <cit>  with the same cutoffs.
annotations from hamap hits were transferred to s. glossinidius cdss including qualifiers ""primary_name"", ""product"" and ""ec_number"" when they were available.
the same approach was followed in fasta searches against internal database of  <dig> bacterial genomes annotated by the same procedure.
finally, individual blastp and fasta searches were carried out with all s. glossinidius cdss against bacterial subdivision of uniprot database  <cit>  and additional functional data were provided by individual searches of each s. glossinidius cds against protein domain databases such as pfam and prosite  <cit> .
tmhmm  <cit> , signalp  <cit>  and psort  <cit>  programs were used to predict transmembrane domains, signal peptides, and cellular localization of gene products, respectively.
the results of all these analyses were integrated together using artemis software release  <dig> and were manually curated at both functional and physical level.
the re-annotated genome sequence of s. glossinidius is shown as supplemental material .
metabolic reconstruction
kegg pathway maps were generated with kegg automatic annotation server  <cit>  from amino acid sequences of genes and pseudogenes.
predicted ec numbers were compared to those transferred during functional re-annotation process in order to ensure a correct assignment of enzymatic functions.
blast2go program  <cit>  and specific blastp searches of dubious enzymatic activities against specific entries of non-redundant protein database subdivision of genbank, to avoid functional over-assignments, were used to complement kaas pathway reconstruction in order to predict mutifunctional enzymes associated with more than one ec number that were not identified with kaas.
extensive literature searches and specialized metabolic databases like ecocyc  <cit>  and metacyc  <cit>  were also used during the analysis of the reconstructed metabolic pathways.
whole genome comparisons
tblastx genome comparisons were generated between s. glossinidius and e. coli k <dig> genomes to help the reannotation process and metabolic reconstruction.
tblastx comparisons were also generated between the genome of s. glossinidius and the complete phage genome subdivision of genbank in order to characterize complete or partial prophage insertions.
whole genome comparisons were analyzed with artemis comparison tool software version  <dig>  <cit> .
RESULTS
pseudogene number adjustment
it was previously described that the genome of s. glossinidius harboured  <dig> pseudogenes  <cit> .
however, their coordinates and the function of the active genes from which they derived were not annotated either in the manuscript or in the genbank file.
we performed a complete pseudogene re-annotation identifying and characterizing  <dig> pseudogenes .
first, we performed a blastx search over s. glossinidius intergenic regions, which allowed us to identify  <dig> potential pseudogenes.
second, individual inspection of fasta and blastp results for each cds allowed us the detection of adjacent pseudogenes that were different frames of a same original functional gene.
we merged these adjacent pseudogenes in single cdss.
third, is element characterization allowed the detection of ancestral genes that were inactivated by their insertions, with the two parts of the ancestral gene flanked by the annotated is element.
the two segments of each disrupted gene were merged in a single cds.
fourth, during the re-annotation process we detected  <dig> situations in which a putative functional gene had been split in an orf included in the primary annotation as a functional gene and a pseudogene detected in our fasta and blastp searches.
these pseudogenes were eliminated from the final re-annotation file and a ""misc_feature"" qualifier were added to the corresponding functional genes specifying the proportion of the ancestral gene represented by the originally annotated gene and the characterized pseudogene .
finally, potential pseudogenes with no significant homology on blastp and fasta searches and no possible functional inference by domain analysis  or cellular location  were eliminated.
despite the reduction over the initial estimations, the final set of  <dig> pseudogenes overcame the  <dig> pseudogenes described in the original annotation  <cit> .
whole genome functional re-annotation
a systematic re-annotation of all cdss was performed based on information derived from similarity searches , protein motif searches , and protein localization prediction .
using the functional classification scheme of the sanger institute , we classified cdss in functional categories .
the highest gene proportion was assigned to surface protein  and mobile genetic element  functional classes.
these numbers correspond to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total number of cdss, respectively.
surface protein functional class includes all integral membrane proteins , secreted proteins, and membrane transporters , but also all genes encoding for enzymatic activities involved in peptidoglycan and bacterial lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
mobile genetic element class contains all transposase coding genes and all genes encoding proteins with homology with prophage elements, including integrases, reverse transcriptases, phage tail proteins and hypothetical phage proteins.
in addition, these two functional classes harbour the highest number of pseudogenes with  <dig> and  <dig> pseudogenes respectively, being also the functional classes most affected by pseudogenization, with pseudogenes representing  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the cdss assigned to surface and mobile genetic elements classes, respectively.
the original annotation described  <dig> genes encoding hypothetical proteins.
after the re-annotation process  <dig> remained annotated as conserved hypothetical proteins, which means that the corresponding proteins are conserved in several bacteria but have an unknown function, and  <dig> as unknown proteins, representing orphan genes with the corresponding protein having no significant homology with any entry of public databases.
this latter result contrasts with the  <dig> genes described in the original s. glossinidius genome paper with no homology with any entry from public databases  <cit> .
this is a consequence of the exponential growth in the number of complete bacterial genomes due to the new generation of sequencing technologies , with more than  <dig>  complete bacterial and archaeal genomes available since the publication of the genome of s. glossinidius in january,  <dig> .
in addition, the use of different sources of information out of blastp and fasta searches allowed to make functional inferences for proteins with no clear functional assignment based only on sequence similarity searches.
a detailed survey of functional reassignments of the  <dig> protein coding genes originally annotated as hypothetical proteins indicates that most functional reassignments were done to mobile dna  and to surface protein  functional classes .
the classes with the fewest number of cdss are those corresponding to enzymes for degradation of large  and small  molecules, representing  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total number of cdss, respectively .
it agrees with the previous observation that s. glossinidius has mainly retained biosynthetic pathways  <cit> .
due to the massive presence of phage-related cdss , a more detailed analysis was done.
they represent a  <dig> % of the total cdss of the genome, being strongly affected by gene inactivation with  <dig> pseudogenes.
these cdss were confirmed as phage-related genes by blastp searches against aclame database of mobile genetic elements , with only  <dig> genes and  <dig> pseudogenes having no-significant homology with any phage-related gene from the database  but showing significant homology with hypothetical phage proteins from non-redundant databases on blastx searches.
tblastx analysis of s. glossinidius complete genome against all completely sequenced phage genomes in genbank allowed the detection of two genome regions with homology with two completely sequenced bacteriophage genomes belonging to the mu-family of double-stranded dna bacteriophages.
the first region, named sglp <dig>  is located between pseudogenes ps_sgl0195c and ps_sgl <dig> and shows strong colinearity with enterobacterial phage mu  at whole genome level.
gene inactivation has affected to  <dig> of the  <dig> cdss included in the prophage region including the genes c and ner, involved in the regulation of lysogeny and lytic development, a and b involved in phage integration and transposition, i encoding a protease and scaffolding protein, and the majority of phage tail assembly genes, indicating the inactivity of this prophage element  <cit> .
in addition, there are  <dig> orphan genes with no homology with any protein coding gene from aclame database or non-redundant databases reflecting the modularity associated with phage evolution, with regions of significant homology interdispersed with unrelated segments  <cit> .
the second region, named sglp <dig>  includes  <dig> cdss comprised between sg <dig> gene and pseudogene ps_sgl <dig>  and shows strong colinearity at whole genome level with burkholderia phage bcepmu , a mu-like bacteriophage isolated from burkholderia cenocepacia strain j <dig> that has closely related homologs in prophage elements from several γ-proteobacterial genomes, sharing a high degree of colinearity, with much less of the mosaicism detected in other bacteriophages, including a common inversion of the entire left end region of their genomes compared with other mu-like prophages  <cit>  also present in the prophage region of sglp <dig> .
in contrast with sglp <dig>  where gene inactivation has affected the majority of cdss of the prophage region, in sglp <dig> only  <dig> out of  <dig> cdss are pseudogenes, retaining a completely functional lysis gene cassette for cell adhesion and invasion together with functional genes for capside formation and dna packaging, and genes involved in the biosynthesis of the contractile phage tail  <cit> .
however, there is no homology at the level of phage control region, that is also absent in the homologous prophage regions of s. typhi ct <dig> and s. typhi ty <dig>  indicating that these prophages are uninducible cryptic prophages  <cit> .
in addition to this two complete prophage elements, there are  <dig> genome regions that show significant homology with different domains of completely sequenced phage genomes including  <dig> domains with homology with phage epsilon  <dig> , that is one of the precursors of s. glossinidius str.
morsitans extrachromosomal bacteriophage-like element psog <dig>  <cit>  .
insertion sequence characterization
due to the massive presence of cdss belonging to mobile genetic element functional class and the proposed role of is element proliferation in the first steps of genome reduction of bacterial endosymbionts  <cit> , a complete characterization of the different types of is elements was carried out.
five different types of is elements were identified in the genome of s. glossinidius representing  <dig> % of the overall genome sequence, all of which showed clear homology with known γ-proteobacterial is families, with their main structural characteristics described in table  <dig>  there are clear differences between is types in terms of functionality and sequence divergence, which are indicative of different stages of is degeneration.
among the five types of is elements, only issgl <dig> and issgl <dig> can be considered as functional is elements by the presence of functional transposase genes clearly conserved at whole sequence level between is copies and with homology with complete pfam domains corresponding to transposases.
the most abundant is element is issgl <dig>  that belongs to is <dig> family of is sequences, with a functional transposase gene that encodes for a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a functional dde domain common to most transposase genes responsible for co-ordinate divalent metal ions, mainly mg+ <dig>  needed during the course of the transposition reaction  <cit> .
among the  <dig> genes originally annotated as transposase genes belonging to issgl <dig> type, only  <dig> contained a complete dde domain and can be considered as functional is elements.
the other is type with functional transposase is issgl <dig>  that belongs to is <dig> family of is elements, a group characterized by the absence of inverted repeats in most of its members as well as the absence of direct repeats flanking the is element after transposition, also observed in complete issgl <dig> elements  <cit> .
however, inverted repeats of  <dig> bp are detected internally of consensus issgl <dig> sequence, with right inverted repeat located inside the transposase gene .
the  <dig> transposase gene copies included in this is type presented the same profile on pfam searches, being all potentially functional transposases except in one case where we detected a premature stop codon in one of the transposase genes belonging to a truncated issgl <dig>  probably reflecting an ongoing process of is degradation.
for the rest of is types , it was no possible the identification of a functional transposase gene common to all components of the is type, despite each is type included originally annotated transposase genes.
a complete copies are those that present inverted repeats at both ends of the transposase gene.
b partial copies correspond to fragments of the putative is element.
c no inverted repeats were detected in issgl5
d no direct repeats were detected in issgl <dig>  issgl <dig>  and issgl <dig> .
e sum of the length of all corresponding complete and partial is elements.
in addition,  <dig> complete and  <dig> partial is elements presents in single copy were characterized during the re-annotation process.
this raises the fraction of s. glossinidius genome represented by is elements to  <dig> %.
of the  <dig> characterized pseudogenes, only  <dig> were originated by the insertion of an is element indicating that is transposition has not been a major force in the process of psudogenization in s. glossinidius.
metabolic reconstruction
a detailed analysis of the metabolic map of s. glossinidius was carried out based on the combined results of kegg automated annotation server and blast2go with the complete set of genes and pseudogenes  together with extensive literature searches and specialized metabolic databases like ecocyc or metacyc that allowed to detect several features do not described in the original annotation.
the most important was the inactivation of the pathway for l-arginine biosynthesis from l-glutamate .
this pathway proceeds through eight enzymatic steps, with five steps involved in l-ornithine production from l-glutamate and three steps for the production of l-arginine from l-ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate, an essential intermediate of pyrimidine biosynthesis  <cit> .
two main patterns for l-arginine biosynthesis differing in the strategy followed to remove acetyl group from the intermediate n-acetyl ornithine have been described.
one is a linear pathway found in members of the enterobacteriaceae and bacilleae in which n-acetyl ornithine is deacetylated by the hydrolytic enzyme acetylornithine deacetylase encoded by the gene arge producing l-ornithine and acetate.
the other is a cyclic pathway, energetically more efficient and found in most prokaryote and eukaryote microbes, which involves a transacylation of n-acetyl ornithine using glutamate as acetate acceptor yielding l-ornithine and n-acetyl-l-glutamate, the first intermediate of the pathway, through a reaction catalyzed by ornithine acetyltransferase encoded by the gene argj  <cit> .
in addition, a third mechanism has been identified in xanthomonadales in which n-acetyl-ornithine is directly transcarbamylated to n-acetyl citrulline by a specific n-acetyl ornithine transcarbamylase and then deacetylated by the common acetylornithine deacetylase  to the l-arginine precursor citrulline  <cit> .
the ancestor of s. glossinidius, as other members of enterobacteriaceae, presented a complete linear pathway for l-arginine biosynthesis from l-glutamate, however, in s. glossinidius, gene inactivation has affected the first , third , fourth  and seventh  steps of the pathway  indicating a complete inability for l-arginine biosynthesis by none of the above described pathways given the inactivation of three of the four enzymatic activities involved in the biosynthesis of the common intermediate n-acetyl ornithine.
the inactivation of the arginine biosynthetic pathway indicates that s. glossinidius needs l-arginine supply from the tse-tse host, which will be accomplished by a functional arginine abc transport system encoded by the genes artm, artq, arti and artp  <cit>  despite the inactivation of the major lysine/arginine/ornithie  abc transport system  and hisq ).
the inactivation of the major lao abc transport system has also consequences in other biosynthetic pathways like putrescine biosynthesis, a polyamine involved in cell development that can be synthesized by two alternate pathways from l-arginine or l-ornithine.
in concordance with the inactivation of l-ornithine biosynthesis from l-glutamate and l-ornithine transport through lao abc transport system, s. glossinidius has retained functional spea  and speb  genes for putrescine biosynthesis from l-arginine, but has inactivated spec gene  required for putrescine biosynthesis from l-ornithine.
the argd gene has also been postulated to additionally encode a succinyldiaminopimelate aminotransferase activity, required for the sixth step of l-lysine and mesodiaminopimelate biosynthetic pathway that produces l-lysine and their precursor mesodiaminopimelate, that constitutes an essential cross-linking moiety of the peptidoglycan component of bacterial cell walls  <cit> .
however, this evidence comes from in-vitro assays of purified argd protein with different substrates, and shows that the affinity for acetylornithine is higher than for succinyldiaminopimelate.
in addition, other studies have determined that there is a specific succinyldiaminopimelate activity in escherichia coli additional to argd encoded aminotransferase  <cit> , in concordance with the presence of plp-dependent aminotransferases of unknown function in the genome of escherichia coli like b <dig>  that encodes a predicted plp-dependent aminotransferase.
it has a functional ortholog in the genome of sodalis glossinidius  not assigned to any pathway, so probably this uncharacterized plp-dependent aminotransferases are responsible for succinyldiaminopimelate aminotransferase activity in l-lysine biosynthetic pathway.
alternatively, it has been also described the replacement of mesodiaminopimelate by the methionine biosynthesis intermediate cistathionine in e. coli  <cit> , so another possible explanation is that cystathionine replaces mesodiaminopimelate in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, leading to the dependence of extracellular l-lysine through a functional apc transporter encoded by the gene lysp .
another important feature of the s. glossinidius metabolism refers to the different pathways for cofactor biosynthesis, which have been postulated as the driving force in the maintenance of the symbiotic association between tse-tse flies and their primary endosymbiont w. glossinidia  <cit> .
a detailed analysis of the metabolic maps of s. glossinidius based on kegg automated annotation server and blast2go results revealed that s. glossinidius does not contain a complete thiamine phosphate biosynthetic pathway.
this suggested that not only tsetse flies but s. glossinidius were dependent of w. glossinidia for its synthesis.
however, the analysis of the thiamine biosynthetic pathway in w. glossinidia, although leads to the detection of some previously non annotated genes, also revealed that the pathway was incomplete lacking the essential thii gene and showing thif as a pseudogene.
the synthesis of the biologically active cofactor thiamine diphosphate in bacteria  <cit>  takes place by several pathways .
the de novo pathway requires the synthesis of two intermediates, a pyrimidine phosphate moiety and a thiazole phosphate moiety.
both are combined by the action of a thiamine phosphate synthase  and a thiamine phosphate kinase  to produce the active cofactor.
the analysis of this metabolism in s. glossinidius  showed that the ancestor of this bacterium probably contained the complete set of genes for its synthesis.
however, a process of degeneration, recently started, completely avoids its de novo biosynthesis yet.
remnants of this situation are  <dig> pseudogenes  together with an originally annotated gene  that presents a premature stop codon probably reflecting an ongoing gene inactivation event.
thus, the most plausible explanation for the presence of the cofactor in s. glossinidius is a salvage pathway through the presence of a functional thiamine abc transport system encoded by the genes thip, thiq and tbpa together with a functional thiamine kinase  and thiamine phosphate kinase  .
however, it implies that sufficient amounts of thiamine should be available from the host, something improbable.
in addition, the s. glossinidius proteome contains remnants activities and proteins related with the pathway, including the ability to synthesize thiazole phosphate carboxylate  through a salvage pathway.
originally annotated gene with premature stop codon
gene absent in w. glossinidia in original annotation but detected in the present study by tblastn against e. coli k <dig> genome
the analysis of the metabolism in w. glossinidia  revealed that it retains functional thih, thig, thie, and thic genes, with no signal of thii gene, and with this and thif genes non annotated but present in the intergenic region between thig and thie .
tblastn analyses with thif and this from e. coli against the complete genome of w. glossinidia confirmed the presence of non annotated this and thif genes immediately downstream thig gene.
however, whereas this has no stops nor frameshifts, the putative thif gene of w. glossinidia contains an internal stop codon that disrupts the translation of the putative thif protein at amino acid  <dig>  before the essential cysteine residue at position  <dig> that is responsible for the disulfide linkage between this and thif that acts as sulfur donor in thiazole phosphate moiety biosynthesis  <cit> .
the absence of these two genes limits the metabolic capability of w. glossinidia to the synthesis of the thiazole moiety thiazole-phosphate, thz-p).
because the metabolic pathways of both symbionts were incomplete we searched for evidences of complementation.
this was revealed through the identification of yjbq gene in s. glossinidius .
the yjbq protein has been recently demonstrated to contain a thiamine phosphate synthase activity able to rescue thiamine auxotrophy in a mutant thie strain  <cit> .
this leads to a scenario in which w. glossinidia synthesizes hmp-pp, and s. glossinidius thz-p. both intermediates may be shared by the endosymbionts with w. glossinidia synthesizing the active cofactor after the action of thie and thil and s. glossinidius after the action of yjbq and thil .
in addition, detailed analysis of cofactor metabolism in w. glossinidia indicated that folate and coenzyme a biosynthesis pathways are severely impaired due to the absence of pab genes  for the biosynthesis of the folate precursor p-aminobenzoate from chorismate, whose biosynthetic pathway from pentose phosphate pathway intermediate erythrose  <dig> phosphate is also absent, and the absence of ilv genes for the biosynthesis of coenzyme a precursor  <dig> -ketoisovalerate, a common precursor for l-valine and coenzyme a biosynthesis.
all this biosynthetic pathways are completely functional in s. glossinidius.
discussion
bacterial endosymbionts of insects are characterized by highly reduced genomes compared to their free-living counterparts due to a massive process of gene inactivation consequence of relaxed purifying selection over high proportion of protein coding genes that are non-essential in the intracellular host-rich medium and the effect of genetic drift that allows slightly deleterious mutations to be fixed in the population due to successive population bottlenecks in the transmission of bacterial endosymbionts from mother to their descendents in a process known as muller's ratchet  <cit> .
this process leads to the massive accumulation of pseudogenes during initial stages of the transition from free-living to host-dependent lifestyle that will be subsequently eliminated from the genome due to the deletional bias associated to bacterial chromosomes  <cit> .
in primary bacterial endosymbionts with long-term associations with their hosts like buchnera aphidicola, blochmannia floridanus, or wigglesworthia glossinidia their highly reduced genomes show few, if any, pseudogenes.
however, it is possible to infer pseudogene remnants in the intergenic regions between orthologous genes in comparisons with their free living relatives  <cit> .
in contrast, facultative endosymbionts and pathogens that recently establish intracellular associations with their hosts have bigger genomes in which the presence of pseudogenes is more evident, like the  <dig> pseudogenes of y. pestis co <dig>  <cit>  or  <dig> pseudogenes of s. flexneri 2a str.
<dig>  <cit> , with the most extreme situation being that of mycobacterium leprae with more than  <dig> pseudogenes  <cit> .
s. glossinidius is one of the few secondary facultative endosymbionts for which their genome has been completely sequenced, revealing an ongoing process of massive genome reduction with an unprecedented number of pseudogenes indicatives of a very recent symbiotic association with their tse-tse host, also confirmed by previous phylogenetic studies that show no-coevolution between tse-tse host and s. glossinidius phylogenetic trees  <cit> .
a detailed survey of s. glossinidius intergenic regions based on blastx searches allowed to increase the number of pseudogenes from  <dig> in the original annotation  <cit>  to  <dig>  this can be explained by the different methodologies used for pseudogene identification.
in the original genome paper, pseudogenes were identified based on the results of different gene-prediction programs, considering pseudogenes all cdss with less than half the lenght of its functional homologs in blastp searches  <cit> , limiting pseudogene identification to recent inactivation events that conserve start/end positions along open reading frame.
by contrast, pseudogene identification based on blastx searches of raw nucleotide sequences against protein databases allows to identify highly degraded pseudogenes whose open reading frames are not predicted by ab-initio gene prediction methods or pseudogenes originated by insertion of is elements.
similar approaches for pseudogene identification identified at least  <dig> additional pseudogenes in the genomes of e. coli/shigella clade  <cit> ,  <dig> additional pseudogenes in y. pestis co <dig> genome  <cit>  or  <dig> potential pseudogenes over  <dig> prokaryotic genomes  <cit> .
in addition,  <dig> originally annotated genes are susceptible to be considered as potential pseudogenes because are situations of cdss shorter than their database homologs, detecting the absent part of the gene as a flanking pseudogene.
the results of the functional re-annotation indicates a massive presence of genes related to mobile genetic elements, being also the functional class most affected by gene inactivation .
mobile genetic element expansion has been traditionally associated to initial stages of bacterial adaptation to host-dependent lifestyle associated to a relaxed selection over non-essential genes under nutrient-rich conditions allowing expansion of mobile genetic elements without detrimental effects to the host  <cit> .
the characterization of the complete set of is elements presents in the s. glossinidius genome revealed that is elements represent only  <dig> % of the genome with an estimated is load of  <dig>  elements per kilobase, similar to other recently host-dependent bacteria  <cit>  although much lower than the estimate loads of is elements for the genomes of sitophilus oryzae and sitohilus zeamays primary endosymbionts , the closest relatives of s. glossinidius within γ-proteobacteria with a divergence time estimated in some 50- <dig> million years ago but with an obligaroty intracellular association in bacteriocyte cells  <cit> .
blastn comparisons with the consensus sequence of the  <dig> different is elements characterized in s. glossinidius against the recently described sequence of four is elements from sope  <cit>  indicate a common origin of issgl <dig> and issope <dig>  whereas there is no similarity between the rest of is elements, possibly reflecting independent acquisitions posterior to the divergence of both lineages.
a detailed analysis of the is flanking regions revealed that only  <dig> out of  <dig> identified pseudogenes were originated by is insertion, reflecting that is transposition has not been a major force in the gene inactivation profile of s. glossinidius.
the majority of pseudogenes are produced by frameshift mutations or premature stop codons, indicating that gene inactivation has been produced by multiple single gene inactivation events generating a lot of non-functional dna that will be eliminated gradually due to the inherent mutational deletional bias associated to bacterial genomes and the lack of selective pressures for the maintenance of these non-functional regions  <cit> .
the high amount of mobile genetic elements are consequence of a massive presence of phage related cdss , including  <dig> complete and  <dig> partial elements with homology with complete bacteriophage genomes.
in bacterial endosymbionts, bacteriophage elements have been identified in recent symbiotic associations like bacteriophages apse- <dig> and apse- <dig> in the secondary endosymbiont of aphids ca.
hamiltonella defensa associated to the protection activity of this secondary endosymbiont killing parasitoid wasp larvae  <cit>  or bacteriophage wo of parasitic wolbachia, originally associated to promote cytoplasmic incompatibility on invertebrate host but recently proposed to be beneficial for the host allowing to control their bacterial loads through lytic development of wo prophage  <cit> .
two of the prophage domains are homologous to phage element epsilon  <dig> , which has been postulated as one of the precursors of the extrachromosomally replicating element of phage origin psg <dig> from s. glossinidius str.
morsitans  <cit> , possibly reflecting a common origin of extrachromosomal psg <dig> and this  <dig> prophage regions of s. glossinidius genome in the tse-tse host glossina morsitans morsitans.
in addition, transposases from is <dig> family have 75% of identity at amino acidic level with a transposase encoded by psg <dig>  also indicative of a flux of genetic material between extrachromosomal element psg <dig> and the bacterial chromosome.
it is important to consider that the structure and presence of bacteriophage-like element psg <dig> is highly variable among s. glossinidius isolates from different tsetse species  <cit> , so it would be expected to observe considerable differences in structure and content of prophage elements associated with s. glossinidius strains from different tse-tse species.
finally, the analysis of s. glossinidius metabolism revealed a metabolic profile closer to free-living bacteria than to obligate mutualists, both in terms of energy production from different carbon sources and in terms of biosynthetic capabilities for most essential metabolites and macromolecules with the unique exception of l-arginine and thiamine.
our analyses disagree with those previously reported for amino acid biosynthesis that indicated that s. glossinidius was able to synthesize all amino acids except l-alanine  <cit> , and showed that l-arginine was the only amino acid lacking a complete biosynthetic pathway.
we have also observed a putative metabolic complementation between s. glossinidius and w. glossinidia to produce the active cofactor thiamine pyrophosphate based on the gene repertoire of both bacteria.
s. glossinidius was unable to produce thiamine  <cit> , while w. glossinidia genome was described as having the potential to synthesize it  <cit> .
the screening for the complete set of genes required for thiamine biosynthesis in w. glossinidia showed lack of two essential components  which would avoid the de novo biosynthesis of thiamine.
however, a detailed revision of the proteins encoded by both endosymbiotic species revealed that each endosymbiont was able to synthesize one of the two moieties that the enzyme thiamine phosphate synthase combines in the pathway for the synthesis of the active cofactor  <cit> .
while w. glossinidia has the capability of synthesizing the pyrimidine moiety , s. glossinidius has that of the thiazole moiety .
considering that both bacterial symbionts were able to acquire the missing metabolite from outside, they would be able to synthesize the cofactor thiamine after the action of thiamine phosphate synthase and thiamine kinase.
the genes encoding these enzymes  are present in the w. glossinidia genome, but only the second in that of s. glossinidius.
we have found that s. glossinidius contains the gene yjbq described recently as a thiamine phosphate synthase gene homolog, having an alanine in position  <dig> of the protein that has been demonstrated experimentally in e. coli that increases enzyme activity  <cit> .
however, it is important to consider that this hypothesis is based on the unique two available genomes sequences of both tsetse endosymbionts, that unfortunately come from different tsetse host species, and as a consequence may not reflect the real metabolic scenario in each tsetse host.
in addition, w. glossinidia is essential for host reproduction and fitness, whereas s. glossinidius have less detrimental effects upon their specific removal from tsetse host due to their more recent association, although it produces a marked decrease in tsetse longevity, so although this potential complementation could be possible in light of genome sequences, it appears not to play a major role in tsetse physiology  <cit> .
in addition, whereas w. glossinidia is detected in all tsetse species, s. glossinidius is not ubiquitous and appears undetected in some glossina species or in different individuals of a particular population.
however, the particular lineage of glossina morsitans morsitans shows high density of s. glossinidius in comparison with other glossina species  <cit> , with similar profiles of symbiont density variation of both s. glossinidius and w. glossinidia through its development that suggests some degree of adaptative regulation of density of both tsetse symbionts by means of glossina morsitans morsitans host  <cit> .
in order to better define the adaptative value of the possible metabolic complementation, not only at thiamine but also at folate and coenzyme a biosynthesis level, both severely impaired in w. glossinidia, it would be necessary to obtain additional genome sequences from both tsetse endosymbionts  to determine if the metabolic profile observed is conserved when the complete symbiotic systems of different tsetse host are compared.
recently, an experimental assessment of the thiamine requirements of s. glossinidius has been carried out, demonstrating experimentally the necessity of an external source of thiamine, specially in the form of thiamine monophosphate, for s. glossinidius survival on cell cultures, and pointing out to their supply to both s. glossinidius and the tsetse host by w. glossinidia, although no direct experimental evidence about this last assumption is provided  <cit> .
just a few cases of complementation between the metabolisms of two insect endosymbionts for mutual benefit have been described.
two types of complementation may be distinguished.
in one case, both endosymbionts produce different end products of the metabolism .
in the other case, each endosymbiont controls part of the biosynthetic pathway, and the combined effort of both is required in order to produce the final product.
the case of sulcia muelleri and baumannia cicadellinicola, endosymbionts of the sharpshooter homalodisca coagulata, illustrates very well both types of complementations  <cit> .
thus, many amino acids are synthesized by s. muelleri and provided to b. cicadellinicola and to the host, except methionine and histidine, which are synthesized by b. cicadellinicola and provided to the co-endosymbiont and the host.
the biosynthesis of one of these amino acids, methionine, is shared between both endosymbionts with s. muelleri providing the intermediate homoserine to b. cicadellinicola.
another case of by biosynthetic pathway sharing is the tryptophan biosynthesis by the two endosymbionts of the aphid cinara cedri  <cit> .
buchnera aphidicola performs the first enzyme step producing anthranilic acid.
it is uptaken by the co-endosymbiont serratia symbiotica which has the genes that encode the remnant steps of the pathway.
then, the produced tryptophan may be supplied to the co-endosymbiont and to the insect host.
CONCLUSIONS
a complete re-analysis of the genome sequence of s. glossinidius has revealed novel insights in the initial stages of the transition from free-living to a host dependent lifestyle in this bacterial genome.
the relaxed selective pressures over non-essential genome regions in the more stable environment of the tsetse host have lead to a massive proliferation of mobile genetic elements in the form of prophages and is elements, although their impact in the process of gene inactivation is minimal, with most of the pseudogenes generated by frameshift mutations or premature stop codons.
a detailed survey of intergenic regions led to the characterization a higher number of pseudogenes than in the original annotation, pointing out to the importance of sequence analysis in the characterization of highly degraded pseudogenes that is not possible to identify by ""ab-initio"" gene prediction methods.
a detailed survey of the metabolic capabilities of genes and pseudogenes together with a comparison with the metabolic profile of tsetse fly primary endosymbiont w. glossinidia based on the gene repertoire of their available genome sequences revealed novel inactive pathways consequence of the gene inactivation process previously undescribed in s. glossinidius, like arginine biosynthesis pathway, together with a possible phenomenon of metabolic complementation between both tsetse endosymbionts at thiamine biosynthesis level.
this possible metabolic complementation together with the incomplete pathways for coenzyme a and folate cofactors in w. glossinidia, both completely functional in s. glossinidius, shed some light about the co-existence of both bacterial endosymbionts in the context of the tsetse host.

",944,"BACKGROUND
symbiotic associations between bacteria and insects are widespread in nature, being postulated as one of the key factors of their evolutionary success. bacterial endosymbionts allow insects to colonize novel ecological niches characterized by unbalanced nutritional sources which would be unavailable without their assistance  <cit> . based on the evolutionary age of the symbiotic association and the extent of codependence between both symbiotic partners, bacterial endosymbionts are classified into primary and secondary. the former are generally essential for their hosts, reside exclusively inside specialized host cells called bacteriocytes, are transmitted by strict vertical transmission from mother to descendents and the associations with their insect hosts are usually ancient. on the other hand, secondary endosymbionts have been more recently acquired by their insect hosts, they are not strictly necessary for host survival, possess a wider tissue tropism, being found both intracellularly and extracellularly in different host tissues and, although mainly transmitted by vertical inheritance, may occasionally be transmitted horizontally, even between species  <cit> . evolutionary symbiotic associations between bacteria and insects, especially when they become obligate intracellular mutualists, have led to several common genomic features  <cit> . many nonessential genes are inactivated and their dna is lost in a stepwise process including many small and some large indel mutations  <cit> . the gradual process leads to very small genome sizes, such as those of the aphid endosymbiont buchnera aphidicola  <cit> , the ant endosymbiont blochmannia  <cit> , or the psyllid endosymbiont carsonella rudii  <cit> . drastically reduced genomes contain gene repertoires with very few, if any, presence of mobile genetic elements and encode highly streamlined metabolisms. sequence evolution is especially distinctive with fast nucleotide substitution rates, specially for nonsynonymous substitutions  <cit> , a strong nucleotide compositional bias toward the increase in a+t, a drastic change in the amino acid composition of proteins and an almost complete loss of the bias of codon usage, which may discriminate between high and low expressing genes  <cit> . gene order stability is another important characteristic of many of these endosymbionts, because almost none genome rearrangement or horizontal gene transfer event is detected  <cit> . the absence of genome flux from other sources may be due to both the restricted intracellular environment and the inability to incorporate foreign dna by recombination  <cit> . the strict vertical transmission from mothers to descendents leads to the coevolution between the bacterial endosymbionts and their hosts  <cit> .

by contrast, the genomes of facultative secondary endosymbionts that have established recent associations with their hosts show heterogeneous genomic features. in some cases, such as sequence evolution, they show intermediate characteristics between free living and obligate endosymbionts  <cit> , while in other cases they already maintain some typical characteristics of free-living species. in recent associations, genome sizes are similar to those of free-living relatives, with very few, if any, compositional bias, higher loads of mobile genetic elements , and an increased amount of non-functional dna, allowing to study the main evolutionary forces acting during this initial stages of the genome reduction process.

sodalis glossinidius is the facultative secondary endosymbiont of the tsetse fly , where it is harboured both intracellularly and extracellularly in different tissues including the midgut, haemolymph, fat body, or milk-gland  <cit> . tsetse flies harbour other two bacterial endosymbionts, the obligatory mutualist wigglesworthia glossinidia, that resides intracellularly inside bacteriocytes, cells that forms the bacteriome organ in the anterior midgut  <cit> , and the parasitic wolbachia, that is localized in ovarian tissues  <cit> .

the genome of w. glossinidia was sequenced in  <dig>  <cit> , and shows the typical features of an ancient obligatory primary endosymbiont, with a highly streamlined chromosome  with 22% gc content and  <dig> protein coding genes . it has retained most genes for cofactor biosynthesis, which is claimed as the main reason for this symbiotic association since endosymbionts may supply the tsetse host with vitamins, which are absent in the vertebrate blood. by contrast, the genome sequence of s. glossinidius  <cit>  revealed genomic features closer to free-living γ-proteobacteria like escherichia coli than to obligatory mutualists, with a genome size of  <dig>  mb and  <dig> % gc content. its main feature was the detection that close to one fourth of cdss were inactive , indicative of a massive process of gene inactivation, which has also been described in other bacterial association, such as the one of the pathogenic bacteria mycobacterium leprae  <cit> . the absence of coevolution between s. glossinidius and tsetse flies and the fact that s. glossinidius is the only bacterial endosymbiont that is able to be cultured in vitro reveals a very recent symbiotic association with the tsetse host  <cit> , providing an ideal system to study the initial steps of the transition from free-living to a host-dependent lifestyle.

we present a complete re-annotation and re-analysis of the genome of s. glossinidius str. morsitans centered in three main aspects. first, the detailed characterization of pseudogenes at both nucleotide and amino acid levels, second, characterization of the different types of insertion sequence  and prophage elements present in the genome and the assessment of their role in the gene inactivation process, and third, the detailed analysis of the metabolic system comprised by s. glossinidius and w. glossinidia in order to evaluate the impact of gene inactivation over metabolic capabilities of s. glossinidius and the extent of metabolic complementation between both symbionts in the context of the symbiotic association with the tsetse flies.

methods
pseudogene annotation
the genome and coding sequences of s. glossinidius  were extracted from genbank . pseudogene boundaries were characterized by a two-step approach. in a first step, intergenic regions between non-overlapping genes with a minimum length of  <dig> base pairs  were used as query sequences against escherichia coli strain k <dig> substrain mg <dig> proteome  using blastx  <cit>  with a maximum e-value cutoff of 10- <dig>  extracting the segments covering each blastx hit in s. glossinidius genome. potential pseudogenes covering at least 25% of encoded protein length were retained, rendering a preliminary set of  <dig> potential pseudogenes. in a second step, new intergenic regions were extracted this time considering originally annotated genes and previously identified pseudogenes and those with a minimum length of  <dig> base pairs  were used as query sequences against proteomes of all completely sequenced bacterial genomes in kegg database  <cit>  at december of  <dig> using blastx with a maximum e-value cutoff of 10- <dig>  this analysis produced a second preliminary set of  <dig> potential pseudogenes. finally, genewise program  <cit>  was used to predict the open reading frames of each potential pseudogene based on the protein sequence of their best blastx hit, and this information was integrated with artemis software release  <dig>  <cit>  joining open reading frames of the same pseudogene.

insertion sequence element characterization
to characterize the major types of is elements of s. glossinidius, its genome sequence was self-compared using nucmer program from mummer package  <cit>  with default conditions. four main blocks of highly conserved repeated sequences with a minimum sequence length of  <dig> bp were identified. they included  <dig> out of  <dig> originally annotated transposase genes. in order to cover the complete is length, repeated sequences of each type  plus  <dig> bp flanking regions were extracted . sequences were aligned with clustalw program  <cit> . inverted repeats were identified with the programs palindrome and etandem included in the emboss package  <cit> . direct repeats flanking each is element were identified by visual inspection of nucleotide sequences. consensus sequences for each alignment were extracted with consense program included in the emboss package. more divergent or partial copies of each is element were identified using the consensus sequences as queries in blastn searches against s. glossinidius genome. finally, in order to characterize minor is elements not detected by the previous approach, the remaining genome sequences were used as query sequence against is finder database  <cit>  using blastx with an e-value cutoff of 10- <dig>  detecting a fifth group of is elements  that was characterized by the same procedure described above.

genes disrupted by is element insertion events were identified by blastx using the two sequences flanking each is element as queries against non-redundant protein database subdivision of genbank  <cit>  with an e-value cutoff of  <dig> - <dig> 

for each type of is element, complete and partial is copies were aligned with clustalw. the p-distance between copies of the same type of element  were estimated with the pairwise deletion option in mega <dig> software package  <cit> , and the segment of the multiple alignment corresponding to each transposase gene was extracted and translated. elements with stop codons or frameshifts in the region corresponding to the transposase gene were considered as defective, whereas, in absence of any further information, substitutions rendering amino acid changes or small indels multiples of three nucleotides were considered to yield functional products.

whole genome functional reannotation
manual re-annotation of all originally annotated protein coding genes and potential pseudogenes was carried out integrating different sources of information. hierarchical functional classification scheme adopted from the sanger institute, that is derived from the more general multifun classification scheme of gene products  <cit> , was used to assign a ""class"" qualifier to each cds reflecting their cellular function. the annotation of e. coli k <dig> genome was adopted as reference given its close evolutionary relationship with s. glossinidius and the precision of its annotation, recently updated by an international consortium  <cit> . orthology between s. glossinidius and e. coli k <dig> protein coding genes was proposed based on reciprocal-best-match fasta searches  <cit>  with cutoffs of 80% of alignment length and 30% of amino acid identity. the annotation from e. coli k <dig> was transferred to the putative s. glossinidius ortholog including qualifiers ""product"", ""ec number"", ""class"", ""gene"" ""function"" and ""note"". reciprocal-best-match fasta searches were also carried out between s. glossinidius genome and hamap database of manually annotated microbial proteomes  <cit>  with the same cutoffs. annotations from hamap hits were transferred to s. glossinidius cdss including qualifiers ""primary_name"", ""product"" and ""ec_number"" when they were available. the same approach was followed in fasta searches against internal database of  <dig> bacterial genomes annotated by the same procedure. finally, individual blastp and fasta searches were carried out with all s. glossinidius cdss against bacterial subdivision of uniprot database  <cit>  and additional functional data were provided by individual searches of each s. glossinidius cds against protein domain databases such as pfam and prosite  <cit> . tmhmm  <cit> , signalp  <cit>  and psort  <cit>  programs were used to predict transmembrane domains, signal peptides, and cellular localization of gene products, respectively. the results of all these analyses were integrated together using artemis software release  <dig> and were manually curated at both functional and physical level. the re-annotated genome sequence of s. glossinidius is shown as supplemental material .

metabolic reconstruction
kegg pathway maps were generated with kegg automatic annotation server  <cit>  from amino acid sequences of genes and pseudogenes. predicted ec numbers were compared to those transferred during functional re-annotation process in order to ensure a correct assignment of enzymatic functions. blast2go program  <cit>  and specific blastp searches of dubious enzymatic activities against specific entries of non-redundant protein database subdivision of genbank, to avoid functional over-assignments, were used to complement kaas pathway reconstruction in order to predict mutifunctional enzymes associated with more than one ec number that were not identified with kaas. extensive literature searches and specialized metabolic databases like ecocyc  <cit>  and metacyc  <cit>  were also used during the analysis of the reconstructed metabolic pathways.

whole genome comparisons
tblastx genome comparisons were generated between s. glossinidius and e. coli k <dig> genomes to help the reannotation process and metabolic reconstruction. tblastx comparisons were also generated between the genome of s. glossinidius and the complete phage genome subdivision of genbank in order to characterize complete or partial prophage insertions. whole genome comparisons were analyzed with artemis comparison tool software version  <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
pseudogene number adjustment
it was previously described that the genome of s. glossinidius harboured  <dig> pseudogenes  <cit> . however, their coordinates and the function of the active genes from which they derived were not annotated either in the manuscript or in the genbank file. we performed a complete pseudogene re-annotation identifying and characterizing  <dig> pseudogenes . first, we performed a blastx search over s. glossinidius intergenic regions, which allowed us to identify  <dig> potential pseudogenes. second, individual inspection of fasta and blastp results for each cds allowed us the detection of adjacent pseudogenes that were different frames of a same original functional gene. we merged these adjacent pseudogenes in single cdss. third, is element characterization allowed the detection of ancestral genes that were inactivated by their insertions, with the two parts of the ancestral gene flanked by the annotated is element. the two segments of each disrupted gene were merged in a single cds. fourth, during the re-annotation process we detected  <dig> situations in which a putative functional gene had been split in an orf included in the primary annotation as a functional gene and a pseudogene detected in our fasta and blastp searches. these pseudogenes were eliminated from the final re-annotation file and a ""misc_feature"" qualifier were added to the corresponding functional genes specifying the proportion of the ancestral gene represented by the originally annotated gene and the characterized pseudogene . finally, potential pseudogenes with no significant homology on blastp and fasta searches and no possible functional inference by domain analysis  or cellular location  were eliminated. despite the reduction over the initial estimations, the final set of  <dig> pseudogenes overcame the  <dig> pseudogenes described in the original annotation  <cit> .

whole genome functional re-annotation
a systematic re-annotation of all cdss was performed based on information derived from similarity searches , protein motif searches , and protein localization prediction . using the functional classification scheme of the sanger institute , we classified cdss in functional categories . the highest gene proportion was assigned to surface protein  and mobile genetic element  functional classes. these numbers correspond to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total number of cdss, respectively. surface protein functional class includes all integral membrane proteins , secreted proteins, and membrane transporters , but also all genes encoding for enzymatic activities involved in peptidoglycan and bacterial lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. mobile genetic element class contains all transposase coding genes and all genes encoding proteins with homology with prophage elements, including integrases, reverse transcriptases, phage tail proteins and hypothetical phage proteins. in addition, these two functional classes harbour the highest number of pseudogenes with  <dig> and  <dig> pseudogenes respectively, being also the functional classes most affected by pseudogenization, with pseudogenes representing  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the cdss assigned to surface and mobile genetic elements classes, respectively.

the original annotation described  <dig> genes encoding hypothetical proteins. after the re-annotation process  <dig> remained annotated as conserved hypothetical proteins, which means that the corresponding proteins are conserved in several bacteria but have an unknown function, and  <dig> as unknown proteins, representing orphan genes with the corresponding protein having no significant homology with any entry of public databases. this latter result contrasts with the  <dig> genes described in the original s. glossinidius genome paper with no homology with any entry from public databases  <cit> . this is a consequence of the exponential growth in the number of complete bacterial genomes due to the new generation of sequencing technologies , with more than  <dig>  complete bacterial and archaeal genomes available since the publication of the genome of s. glossinidius in january,  <dig> . in addition, the use of different sources of information out of blastp and fasta searches allowed to make functional inferences for proteins with no clear functional assignment based only on sequence similarity searches. a detailed survey of functional reassignments of the  <dig> protein coding genes originally annotated as hypothetical proteins indicates that most functional reassignments were done to mobile dna  and to surface protein  functional classes .

the classes with the fewest number of cdss are those corresponding to enzymes for degradation of large  and small  molecules, representing  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total number of cdss, respectively . it agrees with the previous observation that s. glossinidius has mainly retained biosynthetic pathways  <cit> .

due to the massive presence of phage-related cdss , a more detailed analysis was done. they represent a  <dig> % of the total cdss of the genome, being strongly affected by gene inactivation with  <dig> pseudogenes. these cdss were confirmed as phage-related genes by blastp searches against aclame database of mobile genetic elements , with only  <dig> genes and  <dig> pseudogenes having no-significant homology with any phage-related gene from the database  but showing significant homology with hypothetical phage proteins from non-redundant databases on blastx searches. tblastx analysis of s. glossinidius complete genome against all completely sequenced phage genomes in genbank allowed the detection of two genome regions with homology with two completely sequenced bacteriophage genomes belonging to the mu-family of double-stranded dna bacteriophages. the first region, named sglp <dig>  is located between pseudogenes ps_sgl0195c and ps_sgl <dig> and shows strong colinearity with enterobacterial phage mu  at whole genome level. gene inactivation has affected to  <dig> of the  <dig> cdss included in the prophage region including the genes c and ner, involved in the regulation of lysogeny and lytic development, a and b involved in phage integration and transposition, i encoding a protease and scaffolding protein, and the majority of phage tail assembly genes, indicating the inactivity of this prophage element  <cit> . in addition, there are  <dig> orphan genes with no homology with any protein coding gene from aclame database or non-redundant databases reflecting the modularity associated with phage evolution, with regions of significant homology interdispersed with unrelated segments  <cit> . the second region, named sglp <dig>  includes  <dig> cdss comprised between sg <dig> gene and pseudogene ps_sgl <dig>  and shows strong colinearity at whole genome level with burkholderia phage bcepmu , a mu-like bacteriophage isolated from burkholderia cenocepacia strain j <dig> that has closely related homologs in prophage elements from several γ-proteobacterial genomes, sharing a high degree of colinearity, with much less of the mosaicism detected in other bacteriophages, including a common inversion of the entire left end region of their genomes compared with other mu-like prophages  <cit>  also present in the prophage region of sglp <dig> . in contrast with sglp <dig>  where gene inactivation has affected the majority of cdss of the prophage region, in sglp <dig> only  <dig> out of  <dig> cdss are pseudogenes, retaining a completely functional lysis gene cassette for cell adhesion and invasion together with functional genes for capside formation and dna packaging, and genes involved in the biosynthesis of the contractile phage tail  <cit> . however, there is no homology at the level of phage control region, that is also absent in the homologous prophage regions of s. typhi ct <dig> and s. typhi ty <dig>  indicating that these prophages are uninducible cryptic prophages  <cit> . in addition to this two complete prophage elements, there are  <dig> genome regions that show significant homology with different domains of completely sequenced phage genomes including  <dig> domains with homology with phage epsilon  <dig> , that is one of the precursors of s. glossinidius str. morsitans extrachromosomal bacteriophage-like element psog <dig>  <cit>  .

due to the massive presence of cdss belonging to mobile genetic element functional class and the proposed role of is element proliferation in the first steps of genome reduction of bacterial endosymbionts  <cit> , a complete characterization of the different types of is elements was carried out. five different types of is elements were identified in the genome of s. glossinidius representing  <dig> % of the overall genome sequence, all of which showed clear homology with known γ-proteobacterial is families, with their main structural characteristics described in table  <dig>  there are clear differences between is types in terms of functionality and sequence divergence, which are indicative of different stages of is degeneration. among the five types of is elements, only issgl <dig> and issgl <dig> can be considered as functional is elements by the presence of functional transposase genes clearly conserved at whole sequence level between is copies and with homology with complete pfam domains corresponding to transposases. the most abundant is element is issgl <dig>  that belongs to is <dig> family of is sequences, with a functional transposase gene that encodes for a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a functional dde domain common to most transposase genes responsible for co-ordinate divalent metal ions, mainly mg+ <dig>  needed during the course of the transposition reaction  <cit> . among the  <dig> genes originally annotated as transposase genes belonging to issgl <dig> type, only  <dig> contained a complete dde domain and can be considered as functional is elements. the other is type with functional transposase is issgl <dig>  that belongs to is <dig> family of is elements, a group characterized by the absence of inverted repeats in most of its members as well as the absence of direct repeats flanking the is element after transposition, also observed in complete issgl <dig> elements  <cit> . however, inverted repeats of  <dig> bp are detected internally of consensus issgl <dig> sequence, with right inverted repeat located inside the transposase gene . the  <dig> transposase gene copies included in this is type presented the same profile on pfam searches, being all potentially functional transposases except in one case where we detected a premature stop codon in one of the transposase genes belonging to a truncated issgl <dig>  probably reflecting an ongoing process of is degradation. for the rest of is types , it was no possible the identification of a functional transposase gene common to all components of the is type, despite each is type included originally annotated transposase genes.

a complete copies are those that present inverted repeats at both ends of the transposase gene.

b partial copies correspond to fragments of the putative is element.

c no inverted repeats were detected in issgl5

d no direct repeats were detected in issgl <dig>  issgl <dig>  and issgl <dig> .

e sum of the length of all corresponding complete and partial is elements.

in addition,  <dig> complete and  <dig> partial is elements presents in single copy were characterized during the re-annotation process. this raises the fraction of s. glossinidius genome represented by is elements to  <dig> %.

of the  <dig> characterized pseudogenes, only  <dig> were originated by the insertion of an is element indicating that is transposition has not been a major force in the process of psudogenization in s. glossinidius.

metabolic reconstruction
a detailed analysis of the metabolic map of s. glossinidius was carried out based on the combined results of kegg automated annotation server and blast2go with the complete set of genes and pseudogenes  together with extensive literature searches and specialized metabolic databases like ecocyc or metacyc that allowed to detect several features do not described in the original annotation. the most important was the inactivation of the pathway for l-arginine biosynthesis from l-glutamate . this pathway proceeds through eight enzymatic steps, with five steps involved in l-ornithine production from l-glutamate and three steps for the production of l-arginine from l-ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate, an essential intermediate of pyrimidine biosynthesis  <cit> . two main patterns for l-arginine biosynthesis differing in the strategy followed to remove acetyl group from the intermediate n-acetyl ornithine have been described. one is a linear pathway found in members of the enterobacteriaceae and bacilleae in which n-acetyl ornithine is deacetylated by the hydrolytic enzyme acetylornithine deacetylase encoded by the gene arge producing l-ornithine and acetate. the other is a cyclic pathway, energetically more efficient and found in most prokaryote and eukaryote microbes, which involves a transacylation of n-acetyl ornithine using glutamate as acetate acceptor yielding l-ornithine and n-acetyl-l-glutamate, the first intermediate of the pathway, through a reaction catalyzed by ornithine acetyltransferase encoded by the gene argj  <cit> . in addition, a third mechanism has been identified in xanthomonadales in which n-acetyl-ornithine is directly transcarbamylated to n-acetyl citrulline by a specific n-acetyl ornithine transcarbamylase and then deacetylated by the common acetylornithine deacetylase  to the l-arginine precursor citrulline  <cit> . the ancestor of s. glossinidius, as other members of enterobacteriaceae, presented a complete linear pathway for l-arginine biosynthesis from l-glutamate, however, in s. glossinidius, gene inactivation has affected the first , third , fourth  and seventh  steps of the pathway  indicating a complete inability for l-arginine biosynthesis by none of the above described pathways given the inactivation of three of the four enzymatic activities involved in the biosynthesis of the common intermediate n-acetyl ornithine. the inactivation of the arginine biosynthetic pathway indicates that s. glossinidius needs l-arginine supply from the tse-tse host, which will be accomplished by a functional arginine abc transport system encoded by the genes artm, artq, arti and artp  <cit>  despite the inactivation of the major lysine/arginine/ornithie  abc transport system  and hisq ). the inactivation of the major lao abc transport system has also consequences in other biosynthetic pathways like putrescine biosynthesis, a polyamine involved in cell development that can be synthesized by two alternate pathways from l-arginine or l-ornithine. in concordance with the inactivation of l-ornithine biosynthesis from l-glutamate and l-ornithine transport through lao abc transport system, s. glossinidius has retained functional spea  and speb  genes for putrescine biosynthesis from l-arginine, but has inactivated spec gene  required for putrescine biosynthesis from l-ornithine.

the argd gene has also been postulated to additionally encode a succinyldiaminopimelate aminotransferase activity, required for the sixth step of l-lysine and mesodiaminopimelate biosynthetic pathway that produces l-lysine and their precursor mesodiaminopimelate, that constitutes an essential cross-linking moiety of the peptidoglycan component of bacterial cell walls  <cit> . however, this evidence comes from in-vitro assays of purified argd protein with different substrates, and shows that the affinity for acetylornithine is higher than for succinyldiaminopimelate. in addition, other studies have determined that there is a specific succinyldiaminopimelate activity in escherichia coli additional to argd encoded aminotransferase  <cit> , in concordance with the presence of plp-dependent aminotransferases of unknown function in the genome of escherichia coli like b <dig>  that encodes a predicted plp-dependent aminotransferase. it has a functional ortholog in the genome of sodalis glossinidius  not assigned to any pathway, so probably this uncharacterized plp-dependent aminotransferases are responsible for succinyldiaminopimelate aminotransferase activity in l-lysine biosynthetic pathway. alternatively, it has been also described the replacement of mesodiaminopimelate by the methionine biosynthesis intermediate cistathionine in e. coli  <cit> , so another possible explanation is that cystathionine replaces mesodiaminopimelate in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, leading to the dependence of extracellular l-lysine through a functional apc transporter encoded by the gene lysp .

another important feature of the s. glossinidius metabolism refers to the different pathways for cofactor biosynthesis, which have been postulated as the driving force in the maintenance of the symbiotic association between tse-tse flies and their primary endosymbiont w. glossinidia  <cit> . a detailed analysis of the metabolic maps of s. glossinidius based on kegg automated annotation server and blast2go results revealed that s. glossinidius does not contain a complete thiamine phosphate biosynthetic pathway. this suggested that not only tsetse flies but s. glossinidius were dependent of w. glossinidia for its synthesis. however, the analysis of the thiamine biosynthetic pathway in w. glossinidia, although leads to the detection of some previously non annotated genes, also revealed that the pathway was incomplete lacking the essential thii gene and showing thif as a pseudogene. the synthesis of the biologically active cofactor thiamine diphosphate in bacteria  <cit>  takes place by several pathways . the de novo pathway requires the synthesis of two intermediates, a pyrimidine phosphate moiety and a thiazole phosphate moiety. both are combined by the action of a thiamine phosphate synthase  and a thiamine phosphate kinase  to produce the active cofactor.

the analysis of this metabolism in s. glossinidius  showed that the ancestor of this bacterium probably contained the complete set of genes for its synthesis. however, a process of degeneration, recently started, completely avoids its de novo biosynthesis yet. remnants of this situation are  <dig> pseudogenes  together with an originally annotated gene  that presents a premature stop codon probably reflecting an ongoing gene inactivation event. thus, the most plausible explanation for the presence of the cofactor in s. glossinidius is a salvage pathway through the presence of a functional thiamine abc transport system encoded by the genes thip, thiq and tbpa together with a functional thiamine kinase  and thiamine phosphate kinase  . however, it implies that sufficient amounts of thiamine should be available from the host, something improbable. in addition, the s. glossinidius proteome contains remnants activities and proteins related with the pathway, including the ability to synthesize thiazole phosphate carboxylate  through a salvage pathway.

 originally annotated gene with premature stop codon

 gene absent in w. glossinidia in original annotation but detected in the present study by tblastn against e. coli k <dig> genome

the analysis of the metabolism in w. glossinidia  revealed that it retains functional thih, thig, thie, and thic genes, with no signal of thii gene, and with this and thif genes non annotated but present in the intergenic region between thig and thie . tblastn analyses with thif and this from e. coli against the complete genome of w. glossinidia confirmed the presence of non annotated this and thif genes immediately downstream thig gene. however, whereas this has no stops nor frameshifts, the putative thif gene of w. glossinidia contains an internal stop codon that disrupts the translation of the putative thif protein at amino acid  <dig>  before the essential cysteine residue at position  <dig> that is responsible for the disulfide linkage between this and thif that acts as sulfur donor in thiazole phosphate moiety biosynthesis  <cit> . the absence of these two genes limits the metabolic capability of w. glossinidia to the synthesis of the thiazole moiety thiazole-phosphate, thz-p).

because the metabolic pathways of both symbionts were incomplete we searched for evidences of complementation. this was revealed through the identification of yjbq gene in s. glossinidius . the yjbq protein has been recently demonstrated to contain a thiamine phosphate synthase activity able to rescue thiamine auxotrophy in a mutant thie strain  <cit> . this leads to a scenario in which w. glossinidia synthesizes hmp-pp, and s. glossinidius thz-p. both intermediates may be shared by the endosymbionts with w. glossinidia synthesizing the active cofactor after the action of thie and thil and s. glossinidius after the action of yjbq and thil .

in addition, detailed analysis of cofactor metabolism in w. glossinidia indicated that folate and coenzyme a biosynthesis pathways are severely impaired due to the absence of pab genes  for the biosynthesis of the folate precursor p-aminobenzoate from chorismate, whose biosynthetic pathway from pentose phosphate pathway intermediate erythrose  <dig> phosphate is also absent, and the absence of ilv genes for the biosynthesis of coenzyme a precursor  <dig> -ketoisovalerate, a common precursor for l-valine and coenzyme a biosynthesis. all this biosynthetic pathways are completely functional in s. glossinidius.

discussion
bacterial endosymbionts of insects are characterized by highly reduced genomes compared to their free-living counterparts due to a massive process of gene inactivation consequence of relaxed purifying selection over high proportion of protein coding genes that are non-essential in the intracellular host-rich medium and the effect of genetic drift that allows slightly deleterious mutations to be fixed in the population due to successive population bottlenecks in the transmission of bacterial endosymbionts from mother to their descendents in a process known as muller's ratchet  <cit> . this process leads to the massive accumulation of pseudogenes during initial stages of the transition from free-living to host-dependent lifestyle that will be subsequently eliminated from the genome due to the deletional bias associated to bacterial chromosomes  <cit> . in primary bacterial endosymbionts with long-term associations with their hosts like buchnera aphidicola, blochmannia floridanus, or wigglesworthia glossinidia their highly reduced genomes show few, if any, pseudogenes. however, it is possible to infer pseudogene remnants in the intergenic regions between orthologous genes in comparisons with their free living relatives  <cit> . in contrast, facultative endosymbionts and pathogens that recently establish intracellular associations with their hosts have bigger genomes in which the presence of pseudogenes is more evident, like the  <dig> pseudogenes of y. pestis co <dig>  <cit>  or  <dig> pseudogenes of s. flexneri 2a str.  <dig>  <cit> , with the most extreme situation being that of mycobacterium leprae with more than  <dig> pseudogenes  <cit> . s. glossinidius is one of the few secondary facultative endosymbionts for which their genome has been completely sequenced, revealing an ongoing process of massive genome reduction with an unprecedented number of pseudogenes indicatives of a very recent symbiotic association with their tse-tse host, also confirmed by previous phylogenetic studies that show no-coevolution between tse-tse host and s. glossinidius phylogenetic trees  <cit> . a detailed survey of s. glossinidius intergenic regions based on blastx searches allowed to increase the number of pseudogenes from  <dig> in the original annotation  <cit>  to  <dig>  this can be explained by the different methodologies used for pseudogene identification. in the original genome paper, pseudogenes were identified based on the results of different gene-prediction programs, considering pseudogenes all cdss with less than half the lenght of its functional homologs in blastp searches  <cit> , limiting pseudogene identification to recent inactivation events that conserve start/end positions along open reading frame. by contrast, pseudogene identification based on blastx searches of raw nucleotide sequences against protein databases allows to identify highly degraded pseudogenes whose open reading frames are not predicted by ab-initio gene prediction methods or pseudogenes originated by insertion of is elements. similar approaches for pseudogene identification identified at least  <dig> additional pseudogenes in the genomes of e. coli/shigella clade  <cit> ,  <dig> additional pseudogenes in y. pestis co <dig> genome  <cit>  or  <dig> potential pseudogenes over  <dig> prokaryotic genomes  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> originally annotated genes are susceptible to be considered as potential pseudogenes because are situations of cdss shorter than their database homologs, detecting the absent part of the gene as a flanking pseudogene.

the results of the functional re-annotation indicates a massive presence of genes related to mobile genetic elements, being also the functional class most affected by gene inactivation . mobile genetic element expansion has been traditionally associated to initial stages of bacterial adaptation to host-dependent lifestyle associated to a relaxed selection over non-essential genes under nutrient-rich conditions allowing expansion of mobile genetic elements without detrimental effects to the host  <cit> . the characterization of the complete set of is elements presents in the s. glossinidius genome revealed that is elements represent only  <dig> % of the genome with an estimated is load of  <dig>  elements per kilobase, similar to other recently host-dependent bacteria  <cit>  although much lower than the estimate loads of is elements for the genomes of sitophilus oryzae and sitohilus zeamays primary endosymbionts , the closest relatives of s. glossinidius within γ-proteobacteria with a divergence time estimated in some 50- <dig> million years ago but with an obligaroty intracellular association in bacteriocyte cells  <cit> . blastn comparisons with the consensus sequence of the  <dig> different is elements characterized in s. glossinidius against the recently described sequence of four is elements from sope  <cit>  indicate a common origin of issgl <dig> and issope <dig>  whereas there is no similarity between the rest of is elements, possibly reflecting independent acquisitions posterior to the divergence of both lineages. a detailed analysis of the is flanking regions revealed that only  <dig> out of  <dig> identified pseudogenes were originated by is insertion, reflecting that is transposition has not been a major force in the gene inactivation profile of s. glossinidius. the majority of pseudogenes are produced by frameshift mutations or premature stop codons, indicating that gene inactivation has been produced by multiple single gene inactivation events generating a lot of non-functional dna that will be eliminated gradually due to the inherent mutational deletional bias associated to bacterial genomes and the lack of selective pressures for the maintenance of these non-functional regions  <cit> .

the high amount of mobile genetic elements are consequence of a massive presence of phage related cdss , including  <dig> complete and  <dig> partial elements with homology with complete bacteriophage genomes. in bacterial endosymbionts, bacteriophage elements have been identified in recent symbiotic associations like bacteriophages apse- <dig> and apse- <dig> in the secondary endosymbiont of aphids ca. hamiltonella defensa associated to the protection activity of this secondary endosymbiont killing parasitoid wasp larvae  <cit>  or bacteriophage wo of parasitic wolbachia, originally associated to promote cytoplasmic incompatibility on invertebrate host but recently proposed to be beneficial for the host allowing to control their bacterial loads through lytic development of wo prophage  <cit> . two of the prophage domains are homologous to phage element epsilon  <dig> , which has been postulated as one of the precursors of the extrachromosomally replicating element of phage origin psg <dig> from s. glossinidius str. morsitans  <cit> , possibly reflecting a common origin of extrachromosomal psg <dig> and this  <dig> prophage regions of s. glossinidius genome in the tse-tse host glossina morsitans morsitans. in addition, transposases from is <dig> family have 75% of identity at amino acidic level with a transposase encoded by psg <dig>  also indicative of a flux of genetic material between extrachromosomal element psg <dig> and the bacterial chromosome. it is important to consider that the structure and presence of bacteriophage-like element psg <dig> is highly variable among s. glossinidius isolates from different tsetse species  <cit> , so it would be expected to observe considerable differences in structure and content of prophage elements associated with s. glossinidius strains from different tse-tse species.

finally, the analysis of s. glossinidius metabolism revealed a metabolic profile closer to free-living bacteria than to obligate mutualists, both in terms of energy production from different carbon sources and in terms of biosynthetic capabilities for most essential metabolites and macromolecules with the unique exception of l-arginine and thiamine. our analyses disagree with those previously reported for amino acid biosynthesis that indicated that s. glossinidius was able to synthesize all amino acids except l-alanine  <cit> , and showed that l-arginine was the only amino acid lacking a complete biosynthetic pathway.

we have also observed a putative metabolic complementation between s. glossinidius and w. glossinidia to produce the active cofactor thiamine pyrophosphate based on the gene repertoire of both bacteria. s. glossinidius was unable to produce thiamine  <cit> , while w. glossinidia genome was described as having the potential to synthesize it  <cit> . the screening for the complete set of genes required for thiamine biosynthesis in w. glossinidia showed lack of two essential components  which would avoid the de novo biosynthesis of thiamine. however, a detailed revision of the proteins encoded by both endosymbiotic species revealed that each endosymbiont was able to synthesize one of the two moieties that the enzyme thiamine phosphate synthase combines in the pathway for the synthesis of the active cofactor  <cit> . while w. glossinidia has the capability of synthesizing the pyrimidine moiety , s. glossinidius has that of the thiazole moiety . considering that both bacterial symbionts were able to acquire the missing metabolite from outside, they would be able to synthesize the cofactor thiamine after the action of thiamine phosphate synthase and thiamine kinase. the genes encoding these enzymes  are present in the w. glossinidia genome, but only the second in that of s. glossinidius. we have found that s. glossinidius contains the gene yjbq described recently as a thiamine phosphate synthase gene homolog, having an alanine in position  <dig> of the protein that has been demonstrated experimentally in e. coli that increases enzyme activity  <cit> . however, it is important to consider that this hypothesis is based on the unique two available genomes sequences of both tsetse endosymbionts, that unfortunately come from different tsetse host species, and as a consequence may not reflect the real metabolic scenario in each tsetse host. in addition, w. glossinidia is essential for host reproduction and fitness, whereas s. glossinidius have less detrimental effects upon their specific removal from tsetse host due to their more recent association, although it produces a marked decrease in tsetse longevity, so although this potential complementation could be possible in light of genome sequences, it appears not to play a major role in tsetse physiology  <cit> . in addition, whereas w. glossinidia is detected in all tsetse species, s. glossinidius is not ubiquitous and appears undetected in some glossina species or in different individuals of a particular population. however, the particular lineage of glossina morsitans morsitans shows high density of s. glossinidius in comparison with other glossina species  <cit> , with similar profiles of symbiont density variation of both s. glossinidius and w. glossinidia through its development that suggests some degree of adaptative regulation of density of both tsetse symbionts by means of glossina morsitans morsitans host  <cit> . in order to better define the adaptative value of the possible metabolic complementation, not only at thiamine but also at folate and coenzyme a biosynthesis level, both severely impaired in w. glossinidia, it would be necessary to obtain additional genome sequences from both tsetse endosymbionts  to determine if the metabolic profile observed is conserved when the complete symbiotic systems of different tsetse host are compared. recently, an experimental assessment of the thiamine requirements of s. glossinidius has been carried out, demonstrating experimentally the necessity of an external source of thiamine, specially in the form of thiamine monophosphate, for s. glossinidius survival on cell cultures, and pointing out to their supply to both s. glossinidius and the tsetse host by w. glossinidia, although no direct experimental evidence about this last assumption is provided  <cit> .

just a few cases of complementation between the metabolisms of two insect endosymbionts for mutual benefit have been described. two types of complementation may be distinguished. in one case, both endosymbionts produce different end products of the metabolism . in the other case, each endosymbiont controls part of the biosynthetic pathway, and the combined effort of both is required in order to produce the final product. the case of sulcia muelleri and baumannia cicadellinicola, endosymbionts of the sharpshooter homalodisca coagulata, illustrates very well both types of complementations  <cit> . thus, many amino acids are synthesized by s. muelleri and provided to b. cicadellinicola and to the host, except methionine and histidine, which are synthesized by b. cicadellinicola and provided to the co-endosymbiont and the host. the biosynthesis of one of these amino acids, methionine, is shared between both endosymbionts with s. muelleri providing the intermediate homoserine to b. cicadellinicola.

another case of by biosynthetic pathway sharing is the tryptophan biosynthesis by the two endosymbionts of the aphid cinara cedri  <cit> . buchnera aphidicola performs the first enzyme step producing anthranilic acid. it is uptaken by the co-endosymbiont serratia symbiotica which has the genes that encode the remnant steps of the pathway. then, the produced tryptophan may be supplied to the co-endosymbiont and to the insect host.

CONCLUSIONS
a complete re-analysis of the genome sequence of s. glossinidius has revealed novel insights in the initial stages of the transition from free-living to a host dependent lifestyle in this bacterial genome. the relaxed selective pressures over non-essential genome regions in the more stable environment of the tsetse host have lead to a massive proliferation of mobile genetic elements in the form of prophages and is elements, although their impact in the process of gene inactivation is minimal, with most of the pseudogenes generated by frameshift mutations or premature stop codons. a detailed survey of intergenic regions led to the characterization a higher number of pseudogenes than in the original annotation, pointing out to the importance of sequence analysis in the characterization of highly degraded pseudogenes that is not possible to identify by ""ab-initio"" gene prediction methods. a detailed survey of the metabolic capabilities of genes and pseudogenes together with a comparison with the metabolic profile of tsetse fly primary endosymbiont w. glossinidia based on the gene repertoire of their available genome sequences revealed novel inactive pathways consequence of the gene inactivation process previously undescribed in s. glossinidius, like arginine biosynthesis pathway, together with a possible phenomenon of metabolic complementation between both tsetse endosymbionts at thiamine biosynthesis level. this possible metabolic complementation together with the incomplete pathways for coenzyme a and folate cofactors in w. glossinidia, both completely functional in s. glossinidius, shed some light about the co-existence of both bacterial endosymbionts in the context of the tsetse host.

a detailed characterization of mobile genetic elements and pseudogenes reveals a massive presence of different types of prophage elements together with five different families of is elements that have proliferated across the genome of sodalis glossinidius at different levels. in addition, a detailed survey of intergenic regions allowed the characterization of  <dig> pseudogenes, a much higher number than the  <dig> pseudogenes described in the original annotation. pseudogene structure reveals a minor impact of mobile genetic element proliferation in the process of gene inactivation, with most of pseudogenes originated by multiple frameshift mutations and premature stop codons. the comparison of metabolic profiles of sodalis glossinidius and tsetse fly primary endosymbiont wiglesworthia glossinidia based on their whole gene and pseudogene repertoires revealed a novel case of pathway inactivation, the arginine biosynthesis, in sodalis glossinidius together with a possible case of metabolic complementation with wigglesworthia glossinidia for thiamine biosynthesis.


CONCLUSIONS
the complete re-analysis of the genome sequence of sodalis glossinidius reveals novel insights in the evolutionary transition from a free-living ancestor to a host-dependent lifestyle, with a massive proliferation of mobile genetic elements mainly of phage origin although with minor impact in the process of gene inactivation that is taking place in this bacterial genome. the metabolic analysis of the whole endosymbiotic consortia of tsetse flies have revealed a possible phenomenon of metabolic complementation between primary and secondary endosymbionts that can contribute to explain the co-existence of both bacterial endosymbionts in the context of the tsetse host.

"BACKGROUND
enterobacter sakazakii is an opportunistic pathogen associated with the ingestion of reconstituted infant formula, and is a rare cause of neonatal meningitis, necrotising enterocolitis  and sepsis  <cit> .
these cases often occur among low-birth weight preterm neonates, who are generally more susceptible to gram-negative bacterial sepsis and endotoxemia which is associated with nec  <cit> .
the bacterium can persist under desiccated conditions in infant formula for over two years  <cit> .
there have been a number of reported e. sakazakii outbreaks which have been attributed to reconstituted infant formula which may be contaminated at source or during preparation  <cit> .
the virulence of e. sakazakii has been studied by pagotto et al.
<cit>  and mange et al.
<cit>  who showed the presence of enterotoxins and adhesion to brain cells, respectively.
the influence of endotoxin on increased translocation of intestinal bacteria and e. sakazakii in the neonatal rat was demonstrated by townsend et al.
<cit> .
recently, townsend et al.
<cit>  comparatively investigated several e. sakazakii strains showing chronic-patterned brain inflammation in neonatal rats following intracranial inoculation.
these studies further demonstrated the ability of e. sakazakii to invade brain capillary endothelial cells and persist in human macrophages.
the il-10/il- <dig> ratio secreted by these macrophages was high and suggests a type  <dig> immune response may be activated early during e. sakazakii infection that is inadequate to clear the infection  <cit> .
previously, we reported a nicu outbreak in which  <dig> neonates were infected, and  <dig> neonates died  <cit> .
three distinguishable e. sakazakii pulsotypes were isolated from neonates and reconstituted formula.
a fourth pulsotype was isolated from an unopened tin of powdered infant formula.
pulsotype  <dig> was associated with the three deaths, and therefore was potentially more virulent.
a pulsotype is determined by pulsed field electrophoresis  and refers to strains which are not distinguishable by treatment with rare cutting dna restriction enzymes.
however, some strains in pulsotype  <dig> possessed extended spectrum beta-lactamase activities, and therefore some genetic variability existed between these strains.
a summary of the e. sakazakii pulsotypes and neonates is given in table  <dig>  previous publications have not reported the individual case details associated with the isolates under study.
therefore, it is not possible to directly consider correlations between in vitro and in vivo studies.
this is the first report studying in vitro virulence assays using clinical isolates with associated patient details, symptoms and outcomes.
a strains demonstrated extended spectrum β-lactamase activities.
b nec stage ii  is characterised by the systemic signs of temperature instability, apnoea, bradycardia, lethargy with additional symptoms of absence of bowel sounds, radiological signs of intestinal dilation, ileus and pneumatosis intestinalis.
nec stage iii  is where the neonate is critically ill with metabolic acidosis, neutropenia, signs of generalised peritonitis, marked tenderness and distension of abdomen.

RESULTS
in vitro virulence determination
the attachment and invasion of caco- <dig> human epithelial cells was determined after a 3-h exposure period with strains from each e. sakazakii pulsotype and the e. cloacae strain  <dig> from the outbreak.
s. enteritidis, a well documented enteric pathogen capable of attaching and invading caco- <dig> cells was used as a positive control.
pulsotype  <dig>  attached  more than other pulsotypes and s. enteritidis, , which was the positive control .
pulsotype  <dig> strains  associated less with epithelial cells  than s. enteritidis.
strains from pulsotypes  <dig>  and  <dig>  also attached, at relatively low values  compared with s. enteritidis but greater than the e. coli k <dig> negative control .
e. cloacae strain  <dig> attached to caco- <dig> cells more abundantly  than s. enteritidis and the e. sakazakii strains.
all strains showed significantly more attachment than e. coli k <dig>  and significantly more or less than s. enteritidis .
all strains invaded caco- <dig> cells at a significantly  greater value than e. coli k <dig> , and less than s. enteritidis .
strains  <dig> and  <dig> invaded at higher values,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of inoculum , respectively than the other e. sakazakii strains .
while not statistically different, there did appear to be an apparent difference between strains  <dig> and  <dig> with s. enteritidis.
after  <dig> h within u <dig> macrophages, significantly higher numbers of intracellular e. sakazakii were recovered from strains  <dig>  a pulsotype  <dig>  from a fatal nec case and  <dig>  a pulsotype  <dig> isolated from powdered infant formula , than other e. sakazakii strains .
all e. sakazakii strains persisted and were recovered from macrophages at detectable levels at  <dig> h. in contrast to the e. sakazakii strains, there was significantly less uptake and persistence of e. cloacae strain  <dig> in u <dig> macrophages.
at  <dig> h, the number of e. cloacae recovered was significantly less  than the e. sakazakii strains and was not detectable after  <dig> h.
e. sakazakii is associated with rare cases of bacterial meningitis.
therefore, we carried out an in vitro study to investigate the ability of e. sakazakii to invade capillary endothelial cells which comprise the blood-brain barrier.
e. sakazakii strains from the  <dig> pulsotypes were used for invasion studies of rat brain capillary endothelial cells .
invasion was evaluated after inoculation  and gentamicin treatment .
the e. coli k <dig> negative control did not invade this cell line .
however, e. sakazakii strain  <dig> invaded rbcec <dig> cells significantly more than e. sakazakii strains  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and e. cloacae strain  <dig> .
strain  <dig> was from the fatal meningitis case .
e. sakazakii strain  <dig> invaded rbcec <dig> cells significantly more than e. sakazakii strains  <dig>   <dig> and e. cloacae strain  <dig> .
thus, on average, strains  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were the most invasive.
furthermore, all strains tested  had p values  not significantly different from invasive meningitic e. coli k <dig> positive control.
discussion
the strains in this study were from the largest reported outbreak of e. sakazakii in a nicu, with the most deaths, that has been reported to-date  <cit> .
in addition, it is the first report comparing in vitro virulence assays of clinical isolates with associated patient details and clinical symptoms.
e. sakazakii is associated with nec, bacteraemia, sepsis and meningitis.
therefore, attachment to intestinal cells and translocation to systemic tissue are important in the pathogenesis of the organism.
variations in symptoms for each pulsotype could have varied according to dose, neonate age and antibiotic administration.
however, pulsotype  <dig> appeared to be more virulent than pulsotypes  <dig> and  <dig> based on the number of nec, septicaemia, meningitis and fatal cases.
in addition, strains  <dig> and  <dig> in pulsotype  <dig> acquired extended spectrum β-lactamase activity  <cit> .
it is accepted that other unidentified factors could have contributed to the number of neonatal cases and severity of infection, such as duration of exposure.
the attachment of e. sakazakii strains to caco- <dig> cells after a 3-h exposure period was greater than the negative control  e. coli k <dig> .
strain  <dig>  attached to a greater extent than the positive control s. enteritidis .
strain  <dig>  was from an asymptomatic case and showed lower attachment values than the e. sakazakii strains which had caused nec, and meningitis.
the attachment of strain  <dig>  from powdered infant formula, was significantly  higher than  <dig> and  <dig>  and similar to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  e. cloacae strain  <dig> showed the greatest attachment value .
there was no direct correlation between attachment and invasion rates of caco- <dig> cells.
for example, strains  <dig> and  <dig> had the highest attachment rates, yet  <dig> and  <dig> had the highest invasion rates .
all e. sakazakii strains and e. cloacae showed similar potential for invasion.
strains  <dig> and  <dig>  associated with fatal cases of nec and meningitis, showed the highest invasion rates .
this suggests that the ability to invade intestinal cells may be a strong indication of potential virulence and poor outcome in the neonatal host.
most e. sakazakii strains persisted in macrophages for  <dig> h. strains  <dig>  and  <dig>  multiplied significantly in the first  <dig> h. persistence and replication within macrophages suggests that e. sakazakii possess virulence mechanisms to withstand the bactericidal activities within macrophages and evade the host immune response.
controls for macrophage persistence , killing , and replication  comparatively showed that e. sakazakii strains could persist within macrophages for at least  <dig> h and some strains demonstrated moderate  to high  levels of replication.
in contrast to the e. sakazakii strains, there was either no uptake of e. cloacae  by u <dig> macrophage cells, or it was rapidly killed following macrophage uptake.
e. sakazakii is associated with rare cases of bacterial meningitis.
therefore, the ability to invade cells comprising the blood-brain barrier was investigated using rat brain capillary endothelial cell line rbcec <dig>  e. coli k <dig> and c. freundii have been tested in both human brain microvascular endothelial cells  and rbcec <dig> cells and show similar levels of invasion, supporting the use of rbcec <dig> cells as a model of bbb cell invasion  <cit> .
the e. sakazakii strains and e. cloacae  <dig> were able to invade rat brain cells at similar levels as e. coli k <dig> .
e. coli k <dig> is known to cause acute bacterial meningitis in neonates and further demonstrates the virulence potential of e. sakazakii for this host site.
e. sakazakii is invasive for capillary endothelial cells and may gain access to the brain via crossing the normally impenetrable blood-brain barrier with specific virulence mechanisms  <cit> .
the four pulsotypes have been previously described with respect to source, patient symptoms, and phenotypic traits  <cit> .
pulsotype  <dig> strains were isolated from an unopened tin of powdered infant formula and were not associated with any neonatal infections.
it is notable that pulsotype  <dig> strains showed no protease activity on skimmed milk agar plates or capsule production.
whether these phenotypes are related to virulence determinants is unknown, but are under current investigation.
the outcome of infection due to e. sakazakii will be dependent upon a number of factors such as birth weight, age, immune status and antibiotic therapy  <cit> .
in our study, it was not possible to directly correlate clinical symptoms and outcomes with in vitro studies.
nevertheless, we have shown the invasive potential of e. sakazakii with intestinal and blood-brain barrier cells.
in addition, e. sakazakii was able to persist and even replicate for a period within macrophage cells.
these traits appear to facilitate host immune evasion and dissemination.
in addition, e. sakazakii can acquire antibiotic resistance during infection, as shown by the acquisition of extended spectrum β-lactamase activities by strains  <dig> and  <dig>  these two strains were isolated from two neonates, one month apart .
there was variation within pulsotype  <dig> for attachment and invasion of intestinal and blood-brain barrier cells.
whether this reflected the variation in patient symptoms is uncertain.
but it is notable that strain  <dig> had the highest level of endothelial cell invasion, greater than e. coli k <dig>  and was isolated from a fatal meningitis case, the outcome of which could have been influenced detrimentally by the extended β-lactamase spectrum activity the strain had acquired due to its resistance to standard antibiotic therapy.
strain  <dig> was initially identified as e. sakazakii and was isolated from a fatal case of septic shock during the period of the nicu e. sakazakii outbreak .
however, recent 16s rrna gene sequencing revealed it was e. cloacae  <cit> .
this strain showed attachment, and invasion of caco- <dig> endothelial cells, no invasion or no survival in macrophages, and low invasion of rat brain capillary endothelial cells.
therefore, it had the ability to attach and invade intestinal cells, but no propensity for macrophage survival or dissemination, nor an ability to invade the brain.
it had however been able to enter to bloodstream and cause fatal septic shock.
the potential attachment and invasion of host tissue, dissemination and invasion of the blood-brain barrier have been investigated and demonstrated the potential of e.  <dig> sakazakii to infect exposed neonates.
the source of the three pulsotypes could not definitely be attributed to contaminated reconstituted infant formula.
nevertheless the feeding practices of preparation for 24-h periods, and prolonged  administration could have enabled bacterial growth in the reconstituted formula and increased the risk of infection.
CONCLUSIONS
while variables such as host factors and treatment strategies determine the outcome of infection, our in vitro studies evaluated the virulence of the isolates associated with this outbreak.
it was not possible to directly correlate clinical symptoms and outcomes with in vitro studies.
nevertheless, we have shown the variation in invasive potential of e. sakazakii with intestinal and blood-brain barrier cells between and within pulsotypes from a neonatal intensive care unit outbreak.
e. sakazakii strains were able to persist and even replicate for a period within macrophage cells.
these traits appear to facilitate host immune evasion and dissemination.

while variables such as host factors and treatment strategies determine the outcome of infection, our in vitro studies evaluated the virulence of the isolates associated with this outbreak. it was not possible to directly correlate clinical symptoms and outcomes with in vitro studies. nevertheless, we have shown the variation in invasive potential of e. sakazakii with intestinal and blood-brain barrier cells between and within pulsotypes from a neonatal intensive care unit outbreak. e. sakazakii strains were able to persist and even replicate for a period within macrophage cells. these traits appear to facilitate host immune evasion and dissemination.

"BACKGROUND
fear and anxiety-related problems in dogs are common.
in the people’s dispensary for sick animals pet animal welfare report  <cit>   82% of owners reported their dog was afraid of ‘something’.
another study  <cit>  found that 25% of owners considered their dogs to be fearful of noises, but 49% reported at least one behavioural sign suggestive of fear when exposed to loud noises.
the association of pet behaviour counsellors in the uk  <cit>  report that 8% of canine cases were referred for a specific fear or phobia, 6% for owner-absent problems  and 64% for aggressive behaviour towards people and dogs .
in the us, a study  <cit>  found  <dig> % of cases had a specific fear, anxiety or phobia, 14% separation anxiety and 22% fear-related aggression towards people.
both fear and anxiety can occur in the context of the perception of increased threat to the individual  <cit> .
whereas fear occurs in response to the presence of a specific aversive trigger, anxiety develops when an animal anticipates a negative outcome such as in a location where they previously encountered an aversive trigger  <cit> .
in a novel or unpredictable environment, or in a situation of ambiguous threat, a dog may experience anxiety and uncertainty due to a conflict of approach and avoidance tendencies  <cit> .
dogs may also experience anxiety associated with the departure of the owners.
these may arise from fear and anxiety related associations  as well as problems related to separation from an attachment figure .
different neurochemical networks are thought to underpin these different forms of anxiety  <cit> .
a further distinction may also be made between social and non-social stimuli that trigger a response  <cit> .
the affective state of fear and anxiety can operate at the level of: a specific emotional reaction ; a mood change ; or as a feature of temperament .
one method developed for assessing aspects of temperament in dogs is the positive and negative activation scale   <cit> , a reliable and valid measure of positive activation/affect  and negative activation/affect ).
anxious emotional reactions, moods and temperament can all be problematic for an owner and are a cause for welfare concern.
fear and anxiety related problems in dogs are principally resolved using behaviour modification techniques such as desensitisation and counter-conditioning   <cit> .
various psychopharmacological agents have been suggested as potentially useful adjuncts in such cases,  <cit>  including: tri-cyclic antidepressants  e.g.
amitriptyline  <cit>  and clomipramine  <cit> ; tetra-cyclic antidepressants e.g.
mirtazapine  <cit> ; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  e.g.
fluoxetine  <cit> ; monoamine oxidase inhibitors  e.g.
selegiline  <cit> ; progestins e.g.
megestrol acetate  <cit> ; anticonvulsants e.g.
phenobarbital  <cit> ; benzodiazepines e.g.
diazepam  <cit>  and alprazolam  <cit> ; alpha- <dig> adrenergic receptor agonists clonidine  <cit>  and dexmedetomidine  <cit> .
however, there are few psychopharmacological agents licensed for use in dogs.
in the european union , where a licensed drug is not available, veterinary surgeons should follow the prescription cascade as outlined in the european union veterinary medicines directive   <cit> .
although this allows the use of the benzodiazepines listed above because they have a human licence, the prescription cascade regulations indicate that for a different condition in the same species should be given preference.
in the united states , where a veterinary formulation does not exist informed consent can be obtained from a client to use human formulations “extra-label”.
at the time of writing, clomipramine , selegiline , the progestogen megestrol acetate , fluoxetine  and most recently dexmedetomidine  all have veterinary licenses for dogs.
the effects of using medications such as ssris and tcas can typically take around 3–5 weeks to become apparent  <cit> .
benzodiazepines have a faster onset of action  <cit> , but no benzodiazepines are licensed in any form for use in dogs in the eu nor available as veterinary formulations in the us.
benzodiazepines exhibit their effects by binding to a specific benzodiazepine binding site on the inhibitory neurotransmitter gaba  receptor and they can exhibit anxiolytic properties  <cit> .
one retrospective study in dogs explored the anxiolytic properties of diazepam as reported by owners, where the response was variable, where 53% of owners discontinued diazepam therapy due to lack of efficacy and 58% due to adverse effects  <cit> .
in the same study in the group of dogs classed as having ‘thunderstorm phobia’ 100% of owners classed the treatment as effective.
dosages of diazepam varied widely in this study, which is important as the effects of benzodiazepines are dose dependent with moderate doses often needed for anxiolytic effects and higher doses more likely to cause adverse effects such as ataxia  <cit> .
in addition, tolerance can develop with the use of benzodiazepines  <cit> .
however, as benzodiazepines can be highly effective there is value in further exploring the safety and reliability of using this class of drugs as anxiolytics in dogs.
imepitoin  is a low affinity partial benzodiazepine receptor agonist  <cit>  licensed in the eu for the reduction of the frequency of generalised seizures due to idiopathic epilepsy in dogs  <cit> .
when used in dogs, imepitoin appears to be well tolerated and safe  <cit> .
pharmacokinetic studies in dogs show imepitoin has a fast onset of action of around 2–3 h after single oral dosing  <cit> .
fear and anxiety are common behavioural co-morbidities in canine epileptic patients  <cit> .
during the development of imepitoin for the treatment of idiopathic epilepsy in dogs, it was reported anecdotally that some owners wanted to continue using imepitoin due to reported improvements in their dog’s behaviour even when seizure frequency was unaffected  <cit> .
in a variety of experimental rodent models, imepitoin has demonstrated anxiolytic properties .
in addition, being a low affinity partial agonist, the likelihood of developing reduced efficacy related to tolerance and potential for abuse are lower which may offer advantages over full agonist benzodiazepines  <cit> .
the aim of the current study was to undertake an initial investigation of the potential value of imepitoin alongside an individualised behaviour modification programme for the treatment of a range of anxiety and fear related behaviour problems in dogs through a carefully monitored case series.
methods
subjects
cases were recruited following a local publicity campaign via referral from the owner’s regular veterinary surgeon.
clients were offered a free behaviour consultation, blood test, trial medication and follow up for a period of up to three months.
potential cases were screened using a series of inclusion and exclusion criteria .table  <dig> inclusion and exclusion criteria
at least 6 months of age
greater than 5 kg bodyweight
behavioural complaint related to fear-anxiety as diagnosed by a veterinary behaviourist
incidences of behavioural complaint apparent at least twice a week
willing to attend a behaviour consultation at the university of lincoln
willing to commit to giving medication for up to a 3 month period if medication deemed to be of potential benefit to the case
willing to have a blood sample taken from their dog for routine laboratory evaluation , prior to use of any medication
male breeding dog
dogs receiving phenobarbital treatment for epilepsy
any current uncontrolled medical problem
severely impaired hepatic function
severe renal disorders
severe cardiovascular disorders
to be considered for the study,  <dig> initial documents had to be completed: a veterinary referral form to be completed by their referring vet and returned with a full medical history; the university of lincoln animal behaviour clinic standard client questionnaire; a positive and negative activation scale ; an individualised diary  to be completed to provide one week of baseline data for their dog’s reaction in eliciting context established through a telephone discussion.
the diary was adapted from the lincoln sound-sensitivity scale  <cit>  to relate more broadly to recognisable signs of fear and anxiety in contexts other than noises.
to do this an on-line forum of pet behaviour counsellors  <cit>  was asked to provide signs they would attribute to fear and anxiety in dogs.
as a result of this three signs were added to the diary – yawning; licking lips; moving away.
this gave  <dig> specific signs with an additional ‘others’ category.
the ‘frequency’ score was replaced by an ‘event occurrence’ box which could be marked ‘yes’ or ‘no’.
the severity score range was changed from ‘0–5’ to ‘1–5’.
a total score for the dog’s reaction to that eliciting context on that occasion, could then be calculated by totalling each severity score for each sign/category .
examples of eliciting contexts included: encounters with strangers; noises; dogs etc.
the same diary format was used during baseline and the follow up period to monitor the dog’s reactions  based on the owner’s observation and scoring.
for the single dog with separation related problems , video footage was taken weekly whilst the dog was home alone and reviewed by the owner in order to complete the diary scoring.
of the initial  <dig> owners sent this information,  <dig> failed to return the complete paperwork and one dog was euthanized before the consultation for unrelated reasons.
this left  <dig> dogs with suspected fear and anxiety related problems.
the clinician in immediate charge of the case  under the supervision of a european and rcvs recognised specialist in behavioural medicine  assessed all the documents completed at the enrolment stage.
behaviour consultation
each of the  <dig> dogs in the initial group was brought to the university of lincoln animal behaviour clinic for a behaviour consultation, typically lasting 2–3 h. the approach used to establish a diagnosis relating to fear-anxiety adopted the systematic and scientific evaluation of the four key components of emotion  relating to context, physiological arousal, behavioural tendencies and communicative elements.
clinical examination and blood sampling
during the consultation, a full clinical examination was performed on each dog and bodyweight was measured.
jugular venepuncture was performed to obtain a complete blood count, serum biochemistry, thyroid panel  and basal cortisol values for each dog.
behaviour modification programmes
given the wide range of presenting problems, it was not desirable to standardise the treatment protocols for each dog.
behaviour modifications were tailored to the individual, taking into account the dog, the presenting problems, the owner and other factors relating to the dog’s specific environment.
advice was given during the consultation on techniques, which were demonstrated where necessary, and owners were provided with an aide memoire of key points, followed up by a full written report within 7 days of the consultation.
use of imepitoin
as imepitoin is licensed for use in dogs at a dose range of 10-30 mg/kg twice daily, all cases were commenced on a dose around 10 mg/kg twice daily.
during the study, and depending on the individual’s progress, dose alterations were made.
dose changes were made at intervals of no less than two week periods.
the rationale for increasing the dose was twofold: 1) if there was no apparent improvement at the previous dose; 2) if improvement at the previous dose had plateaued and the behaviour problem was not resolved to the satisfaction of the owner and behaviour clinicians.
monitoring during follow-up period
during the follow up period, owners completed an eliciting context diary sheet every time their dog was exposed to an eliciting context identified in the baseline period, and these were submitted to the investigators every two weeks.
these diaries were scored and a telephone call to the owner was arranged to review progress.
end of study
all cases used in the final analysis were followed for at least 3 months including the one week of baseline monitoring before reaching the ‘decision point’ .
at this time owners were asked to complete a second panas and questioned about various aspects of their experience of using imepitoin including: ease of administration; satisfaction with overall treatment success; whether they would use imepitoin at their own expense .
they were also given the clinician’s opinion on using imepitoin for their dog in the future and were offered further advice on behaviour modification as necessary.
in those owners continuing imepitoin responsibility for prescribing imepitoin was passed to the referring veterinary surgeon.
imepitoin can be stopped abruptly, however for those owners stopping imepitoin, guidelines were given for weaning which was typically reducing each dose by 50% for 2 weeks before stopping completely
statistical analysis
the data were analysed informally for evidence of a relationship between imepitoin dosing and owner report of changes in behaviour with statistical analysis undertaken using minitab  <dig>  normality of distribution of data were assessed using anderson-darling normality tests.
effect sizes were calculated for all assessments of difference using cohen’s d  <cit> .
effects on reactions
two main metrics were used to monitor efficacy on fear-anxiety reaction scores: average weekly fear-anxiety reaction scores  and average weekly global fear-anxiety scores .
the equations were developed specifically for this study to use the owner’s diary entry scores to assess response and control for the number of eliciting contexts.
in addition, given that the eliciting contexts did not occur every week, we adopted a method of conservative data imputation in order to avoid having missing scores.
imputations for responses in weeks when the eliciting context did not occur in a given week were made using the following rules: if a week of data was missing during the follow up, the average of the weeks on either side was taken and imputed ; if in the final week of the follow up period, there was no eliciting context, the last value obtained before this was imputed.
this method probably provided a conservative estimate of the effect, potentially underestimating any effect, since it referred back to an earlier stage of treatment.
at all the time points analysed : for the primary measure of interest, average global weekly scores,  <dig> imputations were made out of  <dig> entries ; for the measure of secondary interest, average weekly reactions,  <dig> imputations were made out of  <dig> entries .
all these data related to an absence of the eliciting context in a given week  and not lost data from recorded responses.
statistical analysis was stratified with awr and awg as the primary outcome measures and subsequent analyses post hoc based on the significance of the primary measures.
as there were  <dig> measures a bonferroni correction was applied to awr and awg only as to apply it to all post hoc calculations would risk a type ii error.
average weekly reactions scores
the average weekly reaction score   was calculated for each dog for each eliciting context as shown in the example below for a dog with noise sensitivities: awrindividual noise=sumof diary scoresforthat individual noise that weeknumber of exposurestothat individual noises that week
awrnoises=sumofallawrindividual noisesthat weeknumber of different individual noises exposedtothat week
similar equations were used to calculate awr scores for dogs with social fear-anxiety and also non-social fear-anxiety.
to compare differences in the awr in dogs between eliciting contexts grouped into noise sensitivities, social fear-anxiety and non-social fear-anxiety  whilst on treatment through the study, paired sample t-tests were used.
the accepted level of significance after bonferroni correction was p <  <dig> .
average weekly global scores
the average weekly global score   was calculated for each dog using the following equation: awg=sumofallawrthat weeknumber of eliciting contexts recorded that week
to compare the average weekly global scores in dogs between baseline and specific time points  whilst on treatment through the study, paired sample t-tests were used.
the accepted level of significance after bonferroni correction was p <  <dig> .
effects on temperament
positive and negative activation
to compare the effects of treatment on owner reported positive and negative activation  between baseline and the decision point of treatment, paired sample t-tests were used.
a value of p <  <dig>  was considered significant.
owner satisfaction with treatment
a spearman’s correlation coefficient was computed to assess whether owner satisfaction with treatment success correlated with: i) changes in reactions ; ii) changes in temperament .
a value of p <  <dig>  was considered significant.
at the end of the study, owners were also asked about their interest in continuing treatment with imepitoin at their own expense and to rate the ease of administration of the imepitoin
RESULTS
demographics
the initial group was composed of  <dig> dogs : three dogs were withdrawn from the study: case  <dig> due to change in analgesia during the follow-up period whilst on imepitoin case  <dig> due to a reported adverse event whilst on imepitoin; case  <dig> due to abnormalities in initial laboratory evaluation results before imepitoin was commenced.
this left  <dig> dogs in the final analysis  comprising  <dig> females  and  <dig> males  , of a range of breeds and ages ranging from 1 year 1 month to 10 years 7 months .
bodyweight ranged from  <dig>  kg to  <dig>  kg .
all dogs had been owned for a minimum of 3 months by their owners prior to enrolment.table  <dig> initial group and overview of clinical details and withdrawals

clinical examination and laboratory evaluation findings
clinical examination revealed abnormalities in  <dig> cases, with some cases having more than  <dig> abnormality: gait abnormalities/musculoskeletal problems , interdigital cyst , entropion , dental disease .
further investigations/treatments were performed at the referring veterinary practices.
where this included the use of trial analgesia, or surgical correction  a new baseline week of diary entries was established after recovery/once deemed stable on analgesia for approximately 4 weeks.
laboratory evaluation revealed abnormalities in one dog  indicative of atypical hypoadrenocorticism and this dog did not proceed to the treatment group.
adverse events
among the  <dig> dogs treated with imepitoin,  <dig> adverse events were reported in  <dig> dogs, these were not necessarily associated with medication but are recorded here in accordance with best practice.
two dogs showed signs of ataxia, and  <dig> dog chewed some plastic and vomited.
these three incidents resolved without specific treatment whilst continuing the imepitoin.
recurrence of a pre-existing lameness occurred in case  <dig> resulting in withdrawal from the study by the investigators due to a change in analgesia regime by the referring veterinarian.
diarrhoea was seen in  <dig> dog  which resolved on cessation of imepitoin at 10 mg/kg; when the drug was reintroduced at the lower dose of 5 mg/kg there was no recurrence in diarrhoea and the dog remained on this dose.
case  <dig> had  <dig> episodes of ataxia and muscle tremors,  the first during week  <dig> and the second during week  <dig> of treatment with 10 mg/kg imepitoin.
both of these episodes occurred around the time where noises were audible which had historically resulted in a fearful response.
the blood profile was repeated and no abnormalities were detected.
despite general improvements in behaviour in response to noise out with these events, the owner opted to stop the imepitoin and the dog was withdrawn from the study.
fear-anxiety triggers
of the  <dig> cases used in the final analysis  <dig> cases  had a single eliciting context monitored, with the remaining  <dig> cases  having  <dig> or more eliciting contexts each.
this gave a total of  <dig> different eliciting contexts for fear-anxiety:  <dig> social  and  <dig> non-social .
behaviour modification programmes
behaviour modification recommendations generally included managing the dog’s exposure to triggers which included environmental modifications and reinforcing appropriate behaviour.
other recommendations included introduction of a safe haven at home ; operant counterconditioning protocols with hand-touch to check-in with owner when the dog has heard a noise on walks ; desensitisation and counterconditioning protocols with sound cds ; basket muzzle training ; teaching a ‘go to mat’ behaviour ; introduction of activity feeders ; introduction of front-attaching harness ; desensitisation and counterconditioning to vet practice ; toilet training advice ; cues for ‘say hello, say goodbye’ when meeting and disengaging from other dogs .
the single case of separation related problems was advised on desensitisation to leaving rituals, introduction of safety signal when leaving dog alone, changing leaving/returning ritual and teaching increased independence from owner.
use of imepitoin
during the study, of the  <dig> dogs in the final analysis,  <dig> received a maximum trial dose of around 30 mg/kg twice daily,  <dig> dogs received a maximum trial dose of around 20 mg/kg twice daily and  <dig> dogs remained on the initial dose of around 10 mg/kg twice daily, with  <dig> dog dropping down to and being maintained on 5 mg/kg twice daily.
mean doses of imepitoin being used at key time points were: week  <dig> ; week  <dig> ; decision point .
effects on reactions
average weekly global scores
the primary measure of interest was the average weekly global scores .
an anderson-darling normality test showed that the data distribution was not significantly different from normal across the  <dig> subjects at baseline , week  <dig> , decision point  and mean , but were significantly different to normal at week  <dig> .
in this situation, parametric tests can be used to examine effects within the population studied, but generalisation to the wider population should be more cautious  <cit>  for the data relating to non-normally distributed data.
given the acknowledged preliminary nature of this study , it is therefore acceptable to use parametric tests with this caution acknowledged.
summary effects are displayed in table  <dig> table  <dig> average weekly global fear-anxiety reaction scores for all  <dig> dogs in final analysis
there was a statistically significant difference in the awg between baseline and all specific time points whilst on treatment.
these effect sizes are large and the results indicate that imepitoin alongside a behaviour modification programme had a useful effect on reducing awg in dogs, with an initial meaningful effect being seen within the first week of treatment.
average weekly reaction scores
the secondary measure of interest was the average weekly reaction scores  between the eliciting context groups previously described.
an anderson-darling normality test showed that the data were normally distributed across the average weekly reactions for different eliciting contexts and subjects at baseline , week  <dig>  and week  <dig> , but not at the decision point .
noise sensitive group
for the noise sensitive group , there was a significant difference in the awr between: baseline and week 1; baseline and week 11; baseline and decision point.
there was a larger effect size at week  <dig> and decision point compared to week  <dig>  the data are displayed in table  <dig> table  <dig> average weekly reaction score – noise sensitive group
non-social fear-anxiety group
for the non-social fear-anxiety group  , there was a significant difference in the average weekly reaction scores between: baseline and week 1; baseline and week 11; baseline and decision point.
there was a larger effect size at week  <dig> and decision point compared to week  <dig>  the data are displayed in table  <dig> table  <dig> average weekly reaction score – non-social fear/anxiety group
social fear-anxiety group
for the social fear-anxiety group , there was a significant difference in the average weekly reaction scores between: baseline and week 1; baseline and week 11; baseline and decision point.
there was a larger effect size at week  <dig> and decision point compared to week  <dig>  the data are displayed in table  <dig> table  <dig> average weekly reaction score – social fear/anxiety group
these results suggest that imepitoin alongside a behaviour modification programme has a large statistically significant effect on reducing negative activation  as measured through the panas.
owner satisfaction with treatment
owners were also asked to rate their overall satisfaction with treatment success:  <dig>  were very satisfied,  <dig>  satisfied,  <dig>  partly satisfied/partly dissatisfied,  <dig> dissatisfied and  <dig>  very dissatisfied.
the owner who was very dissatisfied  reported an improvement in anxiety on walks during treatment, but insufficient change in reactions to noises which was the main presenting problem.
there was no correlation between owner satisfaction with either percentile reduction in average global weekly fear-anxiety reactions  or percentile reduction in negative activation from baseline to decision point.
.
continuation of treatment at owners’ expense
of the  <dig> owners,  <dig>  suggested they would use imepitoin at their own expense:  <dig> opted to use it on a continual basis from the end of the follow up period;  <dig> suggested they would consider using it on a tactical basis ;  <dig> suggested they would use it either continually or tactically depending on the outcome of discontinuing the imepitoin on their dog’s behaviour – i.e.
if improvements seen during the treatment period were not sustained, they would consider restarting the use of imepitoin.
the remaining  <dig> owners  suggested they would not consider using imepitoin again.
in  <dig> of the  <dig> cases who opted to stop imepitoin on a continual basis and consider use on a tactical basis, the consulting clinician  would have preferred using the imepitoin on a continuous basis given the reported improvements during the follow up period.
in all other decisions the clinician was in complete agreement with the client’s decision.
ease of administration
at the end of the study, owners were asked to rate the ease of administration of imepitoin with the results being:  <dig>  very easy,  <dig>  easy,  <dig>  moderately easy/moderately difficult.
no owners rated administration as difficult or very difficult.
additional information
owner reported improvements with change in dose of imepitoin
during the study, there were  <dig> owner reports of improvements in behaviour quickly following dose increases in imepitoin suggesting specific efficacy of imepitoin.
five cases where dose was increased from approximately 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg , and  <dig> cases where dose was increased from around 20 mg/kg to around 30 mg/kg .
owner reported reduction in recovery time during treatment with imepitoin
three owners  reported reduction in recovery time  whilst on imepitoin following exposure to fireworks compared to previous years.
owner reported deterioration on cessation of imepitoin
two owners continued to keep diary entries through weaning, and behavioural deterioration on cessation of therapy with continuation of the behaviour modification programme suggests specific efficacy of imepitoin.
in case  <dig> the owner reported an increase reluctance to go for walks which had improved during the period on imepitoin.
in case  <dig> the owner reported an increase in noise sensitivity and reactivity to other dogs at classes which had improved during the period on imepitoin.
dog’s responses from diaries
a total of  <dig> individual diary forms were completed by owners during the study.
dog’s responses for each of the options from the diary were assessed with mean scores between baseline  and the entire treatment period  with the percentage change shown in table  <dig>  there was a reduction in mean scores of all clinical signs across all eliciting contexts during treatment compared with baseline with the exception of one single episode of diarrhoea  when home alone reported for case  <dig> which was reported as an adverse event.table  <dig> clinical signs as reported by owners across all eliciting contexts between baseline and whole period on imepitoin
discussion
these results provide initial evidence of the potential value of using imepitoin alongside a behaviour modification programme in reducing the average weekly global scores reported by owners of dogs with fear-anxiety related problems.
when grouped into noise sensitivity, social and non-social fear-anxiety based problems, a reduction in average weekly reaction scores were seen across all groups.
these effects appeared to be quick acting  but improve over time.
in addition imepitoin alongside a behaviour modification programme significantly reduced owner report of fearfulness as a temperament trait in dogs.
therefore it may be of value in cases where dogs have been identified as having a generally fearful or anxious temperament and potentially to help prevent a recurrence of problems in such individuals, although this remains to be tested empirically.
at the end of the study  <dig> % of owners would consider using imepitoin at their own expense,  <dig> % of owners found imepitoin very easy or easy to administer, and  <dig> % of owners were satisfied or very satisfied with treatment success.
this demonstrates that there were also clinically meaningful improvements being seen by dog owners during the treatment period, although owner satisfaction did not relate to the scale of improvement measured here.
this might be because owner satisfaction may depend on a few signs that are of particular concern to them   <cit>  whereas the metric used to assess improvement considers all signs even if not problematic to the owner.
although case series provide a relatively low level of evidence among clinical studies  <cit>  they can serve an important purpose in advancing medical knowledge  <cit> ; for example, this report provides the first exploration of the potential application of imepitoin as an anxiolytic for clinical behaviour problems.
the majority of dogs had multiple problems extending from fear-anxiety, and so two types of metric were used.
one type of metric  gave a measure of the overall response for the totality of problems.
the other  focused on the response to treatment to particular types of problem, grouped by context into social, non-social or noise related fear-anxiety problems.
this resulted in dogs being included in multiple evaluations for average weekly reaction scores according to which context the problem were apparent, however only data relating to the relevant eliciting contexts for that context were included in that assessment, and not the global problem data.
in the current study, baseline diary entries before commencing treatment meant each dog could acted as its own control, and although there was no control for dogs receiving imepitoin without behaviour modification advice, this is more typical of the recommended way of using medication in clinical behaviour cases.
medication is typically used as an adjunct to behaviour modification advice therefore this study replicates how imepitoin would likely be used in veterinary behavioural practice.
however, given the rapid onset of effect within the first week, the finding that during the study there were  <dig> owner reports of improvements in behaviour quickly following dose increases, and the  <dig> owner reports of deterioration in their dogs behaviour on cessation of imepitoin, it seems likely that there is a specific effect of the drug in these cases and the results are not simply due to the behaviour modification programme.
these improvements seen within the first week of treatment, also raise the question of the potential to use imepitoin tactically.
in the current study, this was important for those owners who saw benefits whilst their dog was on imepitoin but did not wish to use it continuously, but would consider using it at times of the year where there would be an increased risk of exposure to triggers for fear-anxiety .
for these cases it was advised to use imepitoin, in future, at the dose found to be effective during the current study, commencing 1 week before the anticipated onset of problematic triggers, and for the duration of this period .
currently unlicensed benzodiazepines are often used tactically, given 30–60 min before the fear-anxiety trigger is expected, but responses to medication by individuals are often hard to predict  <cit> .
further studies are required to investigate the potential benefits of using imepitoin in this way or in the context of individual dosing in relation to a specific event, in particular, the minimum period of time imepitoin can be given for an effect to be seen.
typically other anxiolytics such as ssris and tcas may have an onset of action of around 3–5 weeks  <cit> , so in cases where a more rapid onset of action is required, imepitoin may be a valuable option.
there were significant differences in reports of reactions to noises between week  <dig> of treatment and both week  <dig> and decision point.
it should be noted that the average dosage of imepitoin being administered across all dogs differed at these time points, as it was determined and increased on an individual basis.
mean dosage at week  <dig> was  <dig>  mg/kg, at week  <dig> was  <dig>  mg/kg, and at the decision point was  <dig>  mg/kg.
reduction in reaction scores could therefore reflect a difference in dose being given, be the result of a longer duration of treatment or reflect the synergistic effect of imepitoin and behaviour modification therapy.
however, in light of these findings 20 mg/kg imepitoin twice daily appears to be a reasonable recommended dose for anxiolytic effects with dose titration built around this dose according to effect.
the study used a standardised diary format to reduce subjectivity in owner responding, and self-reporting to gather data for analysis.
there can be multiple limitations with this method - during the study there were  <dig> owners who suggested that they were failing to record all eliciting contexts resulting in ‘no response’ from their dog.
this suggests that improvements may actually have been under-reported.
the diary was used to record a summary of what the owner saw during the whole event their dog was exposed to the eliciting context, and there was no standardised duration of time each owner was required to observe their dog for.
a caregiver placebo effect has been shown in dogs receiving treatment for osteoarthritis  <cit>  and should also be considered when assessing the data from the study, which can potentially result in over-reporting of improvements by owners.
the diary used did not include a section on recovery time after exposure to an eliciting context however  <dig> owners spontaneously reported reduced recovery times after exposure to noises compared to the time before treatment with imepitoin.
recovery time might therefore be a useful metric to include in future studies.
there were  <dig> dogs with  <dig> reported adverse events during the trial, with a high likelihood  of the imepitoin being implicated in  <dig> of these  but the likelihood of the drug’s involvement in the other  <dig> is largely unknown although in one we consider it unlikely .
paradoxical excitement can occur in species  receiving benzodiazepines  <cit> , and although a potential adverse effect of using imepitoin is transient hyperactivity  <cit> , there were no dogs in the study where this was reported.
tolerance to the effects of benzodiazepines can develop with ongoing use  <cit>  such as those demonstrated in anxiolytic models in mice  <cit> .
the development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam in dogs has also been documented  <cit> ; however tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of imepitoin has not been demonstrated  <cit> .
additionally, when looking at anxiolysis, the results of this study showed significant effects within the first week of treatment with continued improvements seen at week  <dig> and decision points which is not suggestive of tolerance developing within this time frame.
concerns have been raised over the potential for benzodiazepines disinhibiting and therefore increasing aggressive behaviour in dogs and other species  <cit>  and one study reported increased aggressive behaviour and new aggression in a small proportion of dogs treated with diazepam  <cit> .
there were no dogs in the study where aggressive behaviour was reported in the diary entries where it had not been seen before, and overall, there was a  <dig> % reduction in owner reported signs of aggressive behaviour across all dogs whilst on imepitoin compared to the baseline period.
in the human literature, there is conflicting evidence supporting or refuting the amnesic, memory and cognitive impairing effects of long term benzodiazepine use .
during the study there were no reports of adverse events suggestive of memory impairments such as loss of previously learned behaviours.
in addition, all owners were asked to use operant and/or classical conditioning as part of their individualised behaviour modification programmes and subjectively there appeared to be no difficulty in implementation of such training protocols.
it is important to consider both the physical health and concurrent medical problems of any patient presenting with a behavioural complaint  <cit> .
although this study excluded dogs with a history of seizures, given that behavioural co-morbidities are common in canine epilepsy  <cit> , further studies could explore the value of using imepitoin in these patients.
musculoskeletal pain may cause or exacerbate behaviour problems such as aggressive behaviour  <cit> .
fear and anxiety may also amplify pain  <cit> .
for these reasons, it was important to establish that any medical abnormalities detected on clinical examination were investigated and treated prior to commencing imepitoin and a behaviour modification plan, which occurred in  <dig> of the  <dig> dogs enrolled in the study.
indeed  <dig> subjects were not enrolled in the study due to uncontrolled medical reasons, with  <dig> of these related to suspected musculoskeletal pain.
in addition one dog  was withdrawn from the analysis due to recurring lameness which resulted in increased general anxiety and required a change in analgesia.
pain remains an important differential and moderator of response in anxiety cases, and so all cases need careful medical evaluation.
CONCLUSIONS
this report provides the first exploration of the potential application of imepitoin as an anxiolytic for clinical behaviour problems.
this study suggests that imepitoin may be an effective medication to aid the treatment of a range of fear-anxiety based problems when used alongside a behaviour modification programme.
the current veterinary formulation of imepitoin licensed for long term use in dogs with epilepsy appears to be safe and well tolerated.
a dose of 20 mg/kg imepitoin twice daily appears to be an appropriate starting dose for anxiolytic effects in most patients, with a fast onset of action with improvements being seen within the first week of commencing treatment, giving it an advantage over some other classes of anti-anxiety medication such as tcas and ssris.
further research with a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial would be useful to confirm the apparent efficacy reported here.

",818,"BACKGROUND
fear and anxiety-related problems in dogs are common. in the people’s dispensary for sick animals pet animal welfare report  <cit>   82% of owners reported their dog was afraid of ‘something’. another study  <cit>  found that 25% of owners considered their dogs to be fearful of noises, but 49% reported at least one behavioural sign suggestive of fear when exposed to loud noises. the association of pet behaviour counsellors in the uk  <cit>  report that 8% of canine cases were referred for a specific fear or phobia, 6% for owner-absent problems  and 64% for aggressive behaviour towards people and dogs . in the us, a study  <cit>  found  <dig> % of cases had a specific fear, anxiety or phobia, 14% separation anxiety and 22% fear-related aggression towards people.

both fear and anxiety can occur in the context of the perception of increased threat to the individual  <cit> . whereas fear occurs in response to the presence of a specific aversive trigger, anxiety develops when an animal anticipates a negative outcome such as in a location where they previously encountered an aversive trigger  <cit> . in a novel or unpredictable environment, or in a situation of ambiguous threat, a dog may experience anxiety and uncertainty due to a conflict of approach and avoidance tendencies  <cit> . dogs may also experience anxiety associated with the departure of the owners. these may arise from fear and anxiety related associations  as well as problems related to separation from an attachment figure . different neurochemical networks are thought to underpin these different forms of anxiety  <cit> . a further distinction may also be made between social and non-social stimuli that trigger a response  <cit> .

the affective state of fear and anxiety can operate at the level of: a specific emotional reaction ; a mood change ; or as a feature of temperament . one method developed for assessing aspects of temperament in dogs is the positive and negative activation scale   <cit> , a reliable and valid measure of positive activation/affect  and negative activation/affect ). anxious emotional reactions, moods and temperament can all be problematic for an owner and are a cause for welfare concern.

fear and anxiety related problems in dogs are principally resolved using behaviour modification techniques such as desensitisation and counter-conditioning   <cit> . various psychopharmacological agents have been suggested as potentially useful adjuncts in such cases,  <cit>  including: tri-cyclic antidepressants  e.g. amitriptyline  <cit>  and clomipramine  <cit> ; tetra-cyclic antidepressants e.g. mirtazapine  <cit> ; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  e.g. fluoxetine  <cit> ; monoamine oxidase inhibitors  e.g. selegiline  <cit> ; progestins e.g. megestrol acetate  <cit> ; anticonvulsants e.g. phenobarbital  <cit> ; benzodiazepines e.g. diazepam  <cit>  and alprazolam  <cit> ; alpha- <dig> adrenergic receptor agonists clonidine  <cit>  and dexmedetomidine  <cit> .

however, there are few psychopharmacological agents licensed for use in dogs. in the european union , where a licensed drug is not available, veterinary surgeons should follow the prescription cascade as outlined in the european union veterinary medicines directive   <cit> . although this allows the use of the benzodiazepines listed above because they have a human licence, the prescription cascade regulations indicate that for a different condition in the same species should be given preference. in the united states , where a veterinary formulation does not exist informed consent can be obtained from a client to use human formulations “extra-label”.

at the time of writing, clomipramine , selegiline , the progestogen megestrol acetate , fluoxetine  and most recently dexmedetomidine  all have veterinary licenses for dogs.

the effects of using medications such as ssris and tcas can typically take around 3–5 weeks to become apparent  <cit> . benzodiazepines have a faster onset of action  <cit> , but no benzodiazepines are licensed in any form for use in dogs in the eu nor available as veterinary formulations in the us.

benzodiazepines exhibit their effects by binding to a specific benzodiazepine binding site on the inhibitory neurotransmitter gaba  receptor and they can exhibit anxiolytic properties  <cit> . one retrospective study in dogs explored the anxiolytic properties of diazepam as reported by owners, where the response was variable, where 53% of owners discontinued diazepam therapy due to lack of efficacy and 58% due to adverse effects  <cit> . in the same study in the group of dogs classed as having ‘thunderstorm phobia’ 100% of owners classed the treatment as effective. dosages of diazepam varied widely in this study, which is important as the effects of benzodiazepines are dose dependent with moderate doses often needed for anxiolytic effects and higher doses more likely to cause adverse effects such as ataxia  <cit> . in addition, tolerance can develop with the use of benzodiazepines  <cit> . however, as benzodiazepines can be highly effective there is value in further exploring the safety and reliability of using this class of drugs as anxiolytics in dogs.

imepitoin  is a low affinity partial benzodiazepine receptor agonist  <cit>  licensed in the eu for the reduction of the frequency of generalised seizures due to idiopathic epilepsy in dogs  <cit> . when used in dogs, imepitoin appears to be well tolerated and safe  <cit> . pharmacokinetic studies in dogs show imepitoin has a fast onset of action of around 2–3 h after single oral dosing  <cit> . fear and anxiety are common behavioural co-morbidities in canine epileptic patients  <cit> . during the development of imepitoin for the treatment of idiopathic epilepsy in dogs, it was reported anecdotally that some owners wanted to continue using imepitoin due to reported improvements in their dog’s behaviour even when seizure frequency was unaffected  <cit> . in a variety of experimental rodent models, imepitoin has demonstrated anxiolytic properties . in addition, being a low affinity partial agonist, the likelihood of developing reduced efficacy related to tolerance and potential for abuse are lower which may offer advantages over full agonist benzodiazepines  <cit> .

the aim of the current study was to undertake an initial investigation of the potential value of imepitoin alongside an individualised behaviour modification programme for the treatment of a range of anxiety and fear related behaviour problems in dogs through a carefully monitored case series.

methods

to be considered for the study,  <dig> initial documents had to be completed: a veterinary referral form to be completed by their referring vet and returned with a full medical history; the university of lincoln animal behaviour clinic standard client questionnaire; a positive and negative activation scale ; an individualised diary  to be completed to provide one week of baseline data for their dog’s reaction in eliciting context established through a telephone discussion. the diary was adapted from the lincoln sound-sensitivity scale  <cit>  to relate more broadly to recognisable signs of fear and anxiety in contexts other than noises. to do this an on-line forum of pet behaviour counsellors  <cit>  was asked to provide signs they would attribute to fear and anxiety in dogs. as a result of this three signs were added to the diary – yawning; licking lips; moving away. this gave  <dig> specific signs with an additional ‘others’ category. the ‘frequency’ score was replaced by an ‘event occurrence’ box which could be marked ‘yes’ or ‘no’. the severity score range was changed from ‘0–5’ to ‘1–5’. a total score for the dog’s reaction to that eliciting context on that occasion, could then be calculated by totalling each severity score for each sign/category . examples of eliciting contexts included: encounters with strangers; noises; dogs etc. the same diary format was used during baseline and the follow up period to monitor the dog’s reactions  based on the owner’s observation and scoring. for the single dog with separation related problems , video footage was taken weekly whilst the dog was home alone and reviewed by the owner in order to complete the diary scoring. of the initial  <dig> owners sent this information,  <dig> failed to return the complete paperwork and one dog was euthanized before the consultation for unrelated reasons. this left  <dig> dogs with suspected fear and anxiety related problems.

the clinician in immediate charge of the case  under the supervision of a european and rcvs recognised specialist in behavioural medicine  assessed all the documents completed at the enrolment stage.

behaviour consultation
each of the  <dig> dogs in the initial group was brought to the university of lincoln animal behaviour clinic for a behaviour consultation, typically lasting 2–3 h. the approach used to establish a diagnosis relating to fear-anxiety adopted the systematic and scientific evaluation of the four key components of emotion  relating to context, physiological arousal, behavioural tendencies and communicative elements.

clinical examination and blood sampling
during the consultation, a full clinical examination was performed on each dog and bodyweight was measured. jugular venepuncture was performed to obtain a complete blood count, serum biochemistry, thyroid panel  and basal cortisol values for each dog.

behaviour modification programmes
given the wide range of presenting problems, it was not desirable to standardise the treatment protocols for each dog. behaviour modifications were tailored to the individual, taking into account the dog, the presenting problems, the owner and other factors relating to the dog’s specific environment. advice was given during the consultation on techniques, which were demonstrated where necessary, and owners were provided with an aide memoire of key points, followed up by a full written report within 7 days of the consultation.

use of imepitoin
as imepitoin is licensed for use in dogs at a dose range of 10-30 mg/kg twice daily, all cases were commenced on a dose around 10 mg/kg twice daily. during the study, and depending on the individual’s progress, dose alterations were made. dose changes were made at intervals of no less than two week periods. the rationale for increasing the dose was twofold: 1) if there was no apparent improvement at the previous dose; 2) if improvement at the previous dose had plateaued and the behaviour problem was not resolved to the satisfaction of the owner and behaviour clinicians.

monitoring during follow-up period
during the follow up period, owners completed an eliciting context diary sheet every time their dog was exposed to an eliciting context identified in the baseline period, and these were submitted to the investigators every two weeks. these diaries were scored and a telephone call to the owner was arranged to review progress.

end of study
all cases used in the final analysis were followed for at least 3 months including the one week of baseline monitoring before reaching the ‘decision point’ . at this time owners were asked to complete a second panas and questioned about various aspects of their experience of using imepitoin including: ease of administration; satisfaction with overall treatment success; whether they would use imepitoin at their own expense . they were also given the clinician’s opinion on using imepitoin for their dog in the future and were offered further advice on behaviour modification as necessary. in those owners continuing imepitoin responsibility for prescribing imepitoin was passed to the referring veterinary surgeon. imepitoin can be stopped abruptly, however for those owners stopping imepitoin, guidelines were given for weaning which was typically reducing each dose by 50% for 2 weeks before stopping completely

statistical analysis
the data were analysed informally for evidence of a relationship between imepitoin dosing and owner report of changes in behaviour with statistical analysis undertaken using minitab  <dig>  normality of distribution of data were assessed using anderson-darling normality tests. effect sizes were calculated for all assessments of difference using cohen’s d  <cit> .

effects on reactions
two main metrics were used to monitor efficacy on fear-anxiety reaction scores: average weekly fear-anxiety reaction scores  and average weekly global fear-anxiety scores . the equations were developed specifically for this study to use the owner’s diary entry scores to assess response and control for the number of eliciting contexts.

in addition, given that the eliciting contexts did not occur every week, we adopted a method of conservative data imputation in order to avoid having missing scores. imputations for responses in weeks when the eliciting context did not occur in a given week were made using the following rules: if a week of data was missing during the follow up, the average of the weeks on either side was taken and imputed ; if in the final week of the follow up period, there was no eliciting context, the last value obtained before this was imputed. this method probably provided a conservative estimate of the effect, potentially underestimating any effect, since it referred back to an earlier stage of treatment. at all the time points analysed : for the primary measure of interest, average global weekly scores,  <dig> imputations were made out of  <dig> entries ; for the measure of secondary interest, average weekly reactions,  <dig> imputations were made out of  <dig> entries . all these data related to an absence of the eliciting context in a given week  and not lost data from recorded responses.

statistical analysis was stratified with awr and awg as the primary outcome measures and subsequent analyses post hoc based on the significance of the primary measures. as there were  <dig> measures a bonferroni correction was applied to awr and awg only as to apply it to all post hoc calculations would risk a type ii error.

average weekly reactions scores
the average weekly reaction score   was calculated for each dog for each eliciting context as shown in the example below for a dog with noise sensitivities: awrindividual noise=sumof diary scoresforthat individual noise that weeknumber of exposurestothat individual noises that week 
 awrnoises=sumofallawrindividual noisesthat weeknumber of different individual noises exposedtothat week 


similar equations were used to calculate awr scores for dogs with social fear-anxiety and also non-social fear-anxiety. to compare differences in the awr in dogs between eliciting contexts grouped into noise sensitivities, social fear-anxiety and non-social fear-anxiety  whilst on treatment through the study, paired sample t-tests were used. the accepted level of significance after bonferroni correction was p <  <dig> .

average weekly global scores
the average weekly global score   was calculated for each dog using the following equation: awg=sumofallawrthat weeknumber of eliciting contexts recorded that week 


to compare the average weekly global scores in dogs between baseline and specific time points  whilst on treatment through the study, paired sample t-tests were used. the accepted level of significance after bonferroni correction was p <  <dig> .

effects on temperament
positive and negative activation
to compare the effects of treatment on owner reported positive and negative activation  between baseline and the decision point of treatment, paired sample t-tests were used. a value of p <  <dig>  was considered significant.

owner satisfaction with treatment
a spearman’s correlation coefficient was computed to assess whether owner satisfaction with treatment success correlated with: i) changes in reactions ; ii) changes in temperament . a value of p <  <dig>  was considered significant.

at the end of the study, owners were also asked about their interest in continuing treatment with imepitoin at their own expense and to rate the ease of administration of the imepitoin

RESULTS
demographics
the initial group was composed of  <dig> dogs : three dogs were withdrawn from the study: case  <dig> due to change in analgesia during the follow-up period whilst on imepitoin case  <dig> due to a reported adverse event whilst on imepitoin; case  <dig> due to abnormalities in initial laboratory evaluation results before imepitoin was commenced. this left  <dig> dogs in the final analysis  comprising  <dig> females  and  <dig> males  , of a range of breeds and ages ranging from 1 year 1 month to 10 years 7 months . bodyweight ranged from  <dig>  kg to  <dig>  kg . all dogs had been owned for a minimum of 3 months by their owners prior to enrolment.table  <dig> initial group and overview of clinical details and withdrawals

clinical examination and laboratory evaluation findings
clinical examination revealed abnormalities in  <dig> cases, with some cases having more than  <dig> abnormality: gait abnormalities/musculoskeletal problems , interdigital cyst , entropion , dental disease . further investigations/treatments were performed at the referring veterinary practices. where this included the use of trial analgesia, or surgical correction  a new baseline week of diary entries was established after recovery/once deemed stable on analgesia for approximately 4 weeks. laboratory evaluation revealed abnormalities in one dog  indicative of atypical hypoadrenocorticism and this dog did not proceed to the treatment group.

adverse events
among the  <dig> dogs treated with imepitoin,  <dig> adverse events were reported in  <dig> dogs, these were not necessarily associated with medication but are recorded here in accordance with best practice. two dogs showed signs of ataxia, and  <dig> dog chewed some plastic and vomited. these three incidents resolved without specific treatment whilst continuing the imepitoin. recurrence of a pre-existing lameness occurred in case  <dig> resulting in withdrawal from the study by the investigators due to a change in analgesia regime by the referring veterinarian. diarrhoea was seen in  <dig> dog  which resolved on cessation of imepitoin at 10 mg/kg; when the drug was reintroduced at the lower dose of 5 mg/kg there was no recurrence in diarrhoea and the dog remained on this dose. case  <dig> had  <dig> episodes of ataxia and muscle tremors,  the first during week  <dig> and the second during week  <dig> of treatment with 10 mg/kg imepitoin. both of these episodes occurred around the time where noises were audible which had historically resulted in a fearful response. the blood profile was repeated and no abnormalities were detected. despite general improvements in behaviour in response to noise out with these events, the owner opted to stop the imepitoin and the dog was withdrawn from the study.

fear-anxiety triggers
of the  <dig> cases used in the final analysis  <dig> cases  had a single eliciting context monitored, with the remaining  <dig> cases  having  <dig> or more eliciting contexts each. this gave a total of  <dig> different eliciting contexts for fear-anxiety:  <dig> social  and  <dig> non-social .

behaviour modification programmes
behaviour modification recommendations generally included managing the dog’s exposure to triggers which included environmental modifications and reinforcing appropriate behaviour. other recommendations included introduction of a safe haven at home ; operant counterconditioning protocols with hand-touch to check-in with owner when the dog has heard a noise on walks ; desensitisation and counterconditioning protocols with sound cds ; basket muzzle training ; teaching a ‘go to mat’ behaviour ; introduction of activity feeders ; introduction of front-attaching harness ; desensitisation and counterconditioning to vet practice ; toilet training advice ; cues for ‘say hello, say goodbye’ when meeting and disengaging from other dogs . the single case of separation related problems was advised on desensitisation to leaving rituals, introduction of safety signal when leaving dog alone, changing leaving/returning ritual and teaching increased independence from owner.

use of imepitoin
during the study, of the  <dig> dogs in the final analysis,  <dig> received a maximum trial dose of around 30 mg/kg twice daily,  <dig> dogs received a maximum trial dose of around 20 mg/kg twice daily and  <dig> dogs remained on the initial dose of around 10 mg/kg twice daily, with  <dig> dog dropping down to and being maintained on 5 mg/kg twice daily. mean doses of imepitoin being used at key time points were: week  <dig> ; week  <dig> ; decision point .

effects on reactions
average weekly global scores
the primary measure of interest was the average weekly global scores . an anderson-darling normality test showed that the data distribution was not significantly different from normal across the  <dig> subjects at baseline , week  <dig> , decision point  and mean , but were significantly different to normal at week  <dig> . in this situation, parametric tests can be used to examine effects within the population studied, but generalisation to the wider population should be more cautious  <cit>  for the data relating to non-normally distributed data. given the acknowledged preliminary nature of this study , it is therefore acceptable to use parametric tests with this caution acknowledged. summary effects are displayed in table  <dig> table  <dig> average weekly global fear-anxiety reaction scores for all  <dig> dogs in final analysis




there was a statistically significant difference in the awg between baseline and all specific time points whilst on treatment. these effect sizes are large and the results indicate that imepitoin alongside a behaviour modification programme had a useful effect on reducing awg in dogs, with an initial meaningful effect being seen within the first week of treatment.

average weekly reaction scores
the secondary measure of interest was the average weekly reaction scores  between the eliciting context groups previously described. an anderson-darling normality test showed that the data were normally distributed across the average weekly reactions for different eliciting contexts and subjects at baseline , week  <dig>  and week  <dig> , but not at the decision point .

noise sensitive group
for the noise sensitive group , there was a significant difference in the awr between: baseline and week 1; baseline and week 11; baseline and decision point. there was a larger effect size at week  <dig> and decision point compared to week  <dig>  the data are displayed in table  <dig> table  <dig> average weekly reaction score – noise sensitive group 




non-social fear-anxiety group
for the non-social fear-anxiety group  , there was a significant difference in the average weekly reaction scores between: baseline and week 1; baseline and week 11; baseline and decision point. there was a larger effect size at week  <dig> and decision point compared to week  <dig>  the data are displayed in table  <dig> table  <dig> average weekly reaction score – non-social fear/anxiety group  




social fear-anxiety group
for the social fear-anxiety group , there was a significant difference in the average weekly reaction scores between: baseline and week 1; baseline and week 11; baseline and decision point. there was a larger effect size at week  <dig> and decision point compared to week  <dig>  the data are displayed in table  <dig> table  <dig> average weekly reaction score – social fear/anxiety group  




these results suggest that imepitoin alongside a behaviour modification programme has a large statistically significant effect on reducing negative activation  as measured through the panas.

owner satisfaction with treatment
owners were also asked to rate their overall satisfaction with treatment success:  <dig>  were very satisfied,  <dig>  satisfied,  <dig>  partly satisfied/partly dissatisfied,  <dig> dissatisfied and  <dig>  very dissatisfied. the owner who was very dissatisfied  reported an improvement in anxiety on walks during treatment, but insufficient change in reactions to noises which was the main presenting problem.

there was no correlation between owner satisfaction with either percentile reduction in average global weekly fear-anxiety reactions  or percentile reduction in negative activation from baseline to decision point. .

continuation of treatment at owners’ expense
of the  <dig> owners,  <dig>  suggested they would use imepitoin at their own expense:  <dig> opted to use it on a continual basis from the end of the follow up period;  <dig> suggested they would consider using it on a tactical basis ;  <dig> suggested they would use it either continually or tactically depending on the outcome of discontinuing the imepitoin on their dog’s behaviour – i.e. if improvements seen during the treatment period were not sustained, they would consider restarting the use of imepitoin. the remaining  <dig> owners  suggested they would not consider using imepitoin again. in  <dig> of the  <dig> cases who opted to stop imepitoin on a continual basis and consider use on a tactical basis, the consulting clinician  would have preferred using the imepitoin on a continuous basis given the reported improvements during the follow up period. in all other decisions the clinician was in complete agreement with the client’s decision.

ease of administration
at the end of the study, owners were asked to rate the ease of administration of imepitoin with the results being:  <dig>  very easy,  <dig>  easy,  <dig>  moderately easy/moderately difficult. no owners rated administration as difficult or very difficult.

additional information
owner reported improvements with change in dose of imepitoin
during the study, there were  <dig> owner reports of improvements in behaviour quickly following dose increases in imepitoin suggesting specific efficacy of imepitoin. five cases where dose was increased from approximately 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg , and  <dig> cases where dose was increased from around 20 mg/kg to around 30 mg/kg .

owner reported reduction in recovery time during treatment with imepitoin
three owners  reported reduction in recovery time  whilst on imepitoin following exposure to fireworks compared to previous years.

owner reported deterioration on cessation of imepitoin
two owners continued to keep diary entries through weaning, and behavioural deterioration on cessation of therapy with continuation of the behaviour modification programme suggests specific efficacy of imepitoin. in case  <dig> the owner reported an increase reluctance to go for walks which had improved during the period on imepitoin. in case  <dig> the owner reported an increase in noise sensitivity and reactivity to other dogs at classes which had improved during the period on imepitoin.

dog’s responses from diaries
a total of  <dig> individual diary forms were completed by owners during the study. dog’s responses for each of the options from the diary were assessed with mean scores between baseline  and the entire treatment period  with the percentage change shown in table  <dig>  there was a reduction in mean scores of all clinical signs across all eliciting contexts during treatment compared with baseline with the exception of one single episode of diarrhoea  when home alone reported for case  <dig> which was reported as an adverse event.table  <dig> clinical signs as reported by owners across all eliciting contexts between baseline and whole period on imepitoin




discussion
these results provide initial evidence of the potential value of using imepitoin alongside a behaviour modification programme in reducing the average weekly global scores reported by owners of dogs with fear-anxiety related problems. when grouped into noise sensitivity, social and non-social fear-anxiety based problems, a reduction in average weekly reaction scores were seen across all groups. these effects appeared to be quick acting  but improve over time. in addition imepitoin alongside a behaviour modification programme significantly reduced owner report of fearfulness as a temperament trait in dogs. therefore it may be of value in cases where dogs have been identified as having a generally fearful or anxious temperament and potentially to help prevent a recurrence of problems in such individuals, although this remains to be tested empirically. at the end of the study  <dig> % of owners would consider using imepitoin at their own expense,  <dig> % of owners found imepitoin very easy or easy to administer, and  <dig> % of owners were satisfied or very satisfied with treatment success. this demonstrates that there were also clinically meaningful improvements being seen by dog owners during the treatment period, although owner satisfaction did not relate to the scale of improvement measured here. this might be because owner satisfaction may depend on a few signs that are of particular concern to them   <cit>  whereas the metric used to assess improvement considers all signs even if not problematic to the owner.

although case series provide a relatively low level of evidence among clinical studies  <cit>  they can serve an important purpose in advancing medical knowledge  <cit> ; for example, this report provides the first exploration of the potential application of imepitoin as an anxiolytic for clinical behaviour problems. the majority of dogs had multiple problems extending from fear-anxiety, and so two types of metric were used. one type of metric  gave a measure of the overall response for the totality of problems. the other  focused on the response to treatment to particular types of problem, grouped by context into social, non-social or noise related fear-anxiety problems. this resulted in dogs being included in multiple evaluations for average weekly reaction scores according to which context the problem were apparent, however only data relating to the relevant eliciting contexts for that context were included in that assessment, and not the global problem data.

in the current study, baseline diary entries before commencing treatment meant each dog could acted as its own control, and although there was no control for dogs receiving imepitoin without behaviour modification advice, this is more typical of the recommended way of using medication in clinical behaviour cases. medication is typically used as an adjunct to behaviour modification advice therefore this study replicates how imepitoin would likely be used in veterinary behavioural practice. however, given the rapid onset of effect within the first week, the finding that during the study there were  <dig> owner reports of improvements in behaviour quickly following dose increases, and the  <dig> owner reports of deterioration in their dogs behaviour on cessation of imepitoin, it seems likely that there is a specific effect of the drug in these cases and the results are not simply due to the behaviour modification programme.

these improvements seen within the first week of treatment, also raise the question of the potential to use imepitoin tactically. in the current study, this was important for those owners who saw benefits whilst their dog was on imepitoin but did not wish to use it continuously, but would consider using it at times of the year where there would be an increased risk of exposure to triggers for fear-anxiety . for these cases it was advised to use imepitoin, in future, at the dose found to be effective during the current study, commencing 1 week before the anticipated onset of problematic triggers, and for the duration of this period . currently unlicensed benzodiazepines are often used tactically, given 30–60 min before the fear-anxiety trigger is expected, but responses to medication by individuals are often hard to predict  <cit> . further studies are required to investigate the potential benefits of using imepitoin in this way or in the context of individual dosing in relation to a specific event, in particular, the minimum period of time imepitoin can be given for an effect to be seen. typically other anxiolytics such as ssris and tcas may have an onset of action of around 3–5 weeks  <cit> , so in cases where a more rapid onset of action is required, imepitoin may be a valuable option.

there were significant differences in reports of reactions to noises between week  <dig> of treatment and both week  <dig> and decision point. it should be noted that the average dosage of imepitoin being administered across all dogs differed at these time points, as it was determined and increased on an individual basis. mean dosage at week  <dig> was  <dig>  mg/kg, at week  <dig> was  <dig>  mg/kg, and at the decision point was  <dig>  mg/kg. reduction in reaction scores could therefore reflect a difference in dose being given, be the result of a longer duration of treatment or reflect the synergistic effect of imepitoin and behaviour modification therapy. however, in light of these findings 20 mg/kg imepitoin twice daily appears to be a reasonable recommended dose for anxiolytic effects with dose titration built around this dose according to effect.

the study used a standardised diary format to reduce subjectivity in owner responding, and self-reporting to gather data for analysis. there can be multiple limitations with this method - during the study there were  <dig> owners who suggested that they were failing to record all eliciting contexts resulting in ‘no response’ from their dog. this suggests that improvements may actually have been under-reported. the diary was used to record a summary of what the owner saw during the whole event their dog was exposed to the eliciting context, and there was no standardised duration of time each owner was required to observe their dog for. a caregiver placebo effect has been shown in dogs receiving treatment for osteoarthritis  <cit>  and should also be considered when assessing the data from the study, which can potentially result in over-reporting of improvements by owners. the diary used did not include a section on recovery time after exposure to an eliciting context however  <dig> owners spontaneously reported reduced recovery times after exposure to noises compared to the time before treatment with imepitoin. recovery time might therefore be a useful metric to include in future studies.

there were  <dig> dogs with  <dig> reported adverse events during the trial, with a high likelihood  of the imepitoin being implicated in  <dig> of these  but the likelihood of the drug’s involvement in the other  <dig> is largely unknown although in one we consider it unlikely .

paradoxical excitement can occur in species  receiving benzodiazepines  <cit> , and although a potential adverse effect of using imepitoin is transient hyperactivity  <cit> , there were no dogs in the study where this was reported.

tolerance to the effects of benzodiazepines can develop with ongoing use  <cit>  such as those demonstrated in anxiolytic models in mice  <cit> . the development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam in dogs has also been documented  <cit> ; however tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of imepitoin has not been demonstrated  <cit> . additionally, when looking at anxiolysis, the results of this study showed significant effects within the first week of treatment with continued improvements seen at week  <dig> and decision points which is not suggestive of tolerance developing within this time frame.

concerns have been raised over the potential for benzodiazepines disinhibiting and therefore increasing aggressive behaviour in dogs and other species  <cit>  and one study reported increased aggressive behaviour and new aggression in a small proportion of dogs treated with diazepam  <cit> . there were no dogs in the study where aggressive behaviour was reported in the diary entries where it had not been seen before, and overall, there was a  <dig> % reduction in owner reported signs of aggressive behaviour across all dogs whilst on imepitoin compared to the baseline period.

in the human literature, there is conflicting evidence supporting or refuting the amnesic, memory and cognitive impairing effects of long term benzodiazepine use . during the study there were no reports of adverse events suggestive of memory impairments such as loss of previously learned behaviours. in addition, all owners were asked to use operant and/or classical conditioning as part of their individualised behaviour modification programmes and subjectively there appeared to be no difficulty in implementation of such training protocols.

it is important to consider both the physical health and concurrent medical problems of any patient presenting with a behavioural complaint  <cit> . although this study excluded dogs with a history of seizures, given that behavioural co-morbidities are common in canine epilepsy  <cit> , further studies could explore the value of using imepitoin in these patients. musculoskeletal pain may cause or exacerbate behaviour problems such as aggressive behaviour  <cit> . fear and anxiety may also amplify pain  <cit> . for these reasons, it was important to establish that any medical abnormalities detected on clinical examination were investigated and treated prior to commencing imepitoin and a behaviour modification plan, which occurred in  <dig> of the  <dig> dogs enrolled in the study. indeed  <dig> subjects were not enrolled in the study due to uncontrolled medical reasons, with  <dig> of these related to suspected musculoskeletal pain. in addition one dog  was withdrawn from the analysis due to recurring lameness which resulted in increased general anxiety and required a change in analgesia. pain remains an important differential and moderator of response in anxiety cases, and so all cases need careful medical evaluation.

CONCLUSIONS
this report provides the first exploration of the potential application of imepitoin as an anxiolytic for clinical behaviour problems. this study suggests that imepitoin may be an effective medication to aid the treatment of a range of fear-anxiety based problems when used alongside a behaviour modification programme. the current veterinary formulation of imepitoin licensed for long term use in dogs with epilepsy appears to be safe and well tolerated. a dose of 20 mg/kg imepitoin twice daily appears to be an appropriate starting dose for anxiolytic effects in most patients, with a fast onset of action with improvements being seen within the first week of commencing treatment, giving it an advantage over some other classes of anti-anxiety medication such as tcas and ssris. further research with a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial would be useful to confirm the apparent efficacy reported here.

","BACKGROUND
fear and anxiety based problems are common in dogs. alongside behaviour modification programmes, a range of psychopharmacological agents may be recommended to treat such problems, but few are licensed for use in dogs and the onset of action of some can be delayed. the low affinity partial benzodiazepine receptor agonist imepitoin  is licensed for treating canine epilepsy, has a fast onset of action in dogs and has demonstrated anxiolytic properties in rodent models. this case series reports on the use of imepitoin in a group of dogs identified as having fear/anxiety based problems. twenty dogs were enrolled into the study, attended a behaviour consultation and underwent routine laboratory evaluation. nineteen dogs proceeded to be treated with imepitoin orally twice daily  alongside a patient-specific behaviour modification plan for a period of 11–19 weeks. progress was monitored via owner report through daily diary entries and telephone follow-up every two weeks. a positive and negative activation scale  of temperament was also completed by owners during baseline and at the end of the study.


RESULTS
the primary outcome measure was average weekly global scores  from the owner diaries. average weekly reaction scores  for each type of eliciting context was used as a secondary outcome. seventeen dogs completed the trial. treatment with imepitoin alongside a behaviour modification programme resulted in owner reported improvement with reduced awg and reduced awr for anxiety across a range of social and non-social eliciting contexts including noise sensitivities. significant improvement was apparent within the first week of treatment, and further improvements seen at the 11 week review point. there was a significant reduction in negative activation  with  <dig> % of owners opting to continue imepitoin at their own expense after completion of the study.

"BACKGROUND
impactions are a common cause of colic  <cit> , and occur when ingesta causes obstruction of the digestive tract.
they can occur throughout the gastrointestinal tract, but most frequently affect the large colon.
the location of the impaction affects both treatment and prognosis.
caecal and small colon impactions have a high rate of surgical intervention, with referral hospital based case studies reporting surgical intervention rates of 43% of  <dig> cases of caecal impaction  <cit> , and 44% of  <dig> cases of small colon impaction  <cit> .
caecal impactions have a high risk of rupture, with a mortality rate of 25%  <cit> .
in contrast, large colon impactions usually have a successful outcome with simple medical treatment, but a small number may require prolonged fluid therapy or surgical treatment  <cit> .
dabareiner and white  reported on a case series of large colon impactions from a referral hospital population, with 16% of cases requiring surgery, and a survival rate of 95% for medical cases, and 58% for surgical cases  <cit> .
a number of risk factors are anecdotally linked with large intestinal impactions; hillyer et al.
identified management factors which were significantly associated with scod  in a case control study of  <dig> horses admitted to two uk university referral hospitals  <cit> .
the current published evidence on risk factors, clinical presentation and decision making in large colon impaction cases is based on referral hospital populations  <cit> , which represent a particular section of the case population.
there is a lack of evidence from first opinion practice on the wider population, and on how large colon impaction cases initially present to the veterinary surgeon.
the aim of this study was to describe the initial clinical presentation, and the diagnostic tests and treatments used by veterinary practitioners on the primary assessment of horses with large colon impactions.
the study objectives were:
• to describe the history and signalment of large colon impaction cases in a prospective study of the primary presentation of horses with colic to veterinary practitioners.
• to characterise the clinical findings of large colon impaction cases at initial presentation in a prospective study of horses with colic
• to determine how clinical findings of large colon impaction cases on primary presentation relate to final case outcome
• to describe the diagnostic tests and treatments used by veterinary practitioners on the primary assessment of large colon impaction cases.
methods
study population and data collection
this study reviewed case records relating to impaction cases, obtained from a national survey of the primary presentation of colic cases in the uk, undertaken by the school of veterinary medicine and science, university of nottingham .
the study was reviewed and approved by the school of veterinary medicine and science ethics committee.
the national colic survey was distributed to  <dig> practices registered with the rcvs in the uk as treating horses, and the launch of the survey was highlighted in the veterinary record and equine veterinary education journals, and through the university of nottingham, rcvs charitable trust and beva websites.
veterinary surgeons wishing to participate registered for the survey, and were given a unique reference number to provide confidentiality.
they were then asked to submit data on colic cases seen, using an online or paper based recording system.
colic was defined as ‘an incidence of any condition signified by one or more indicators of acute abdominal pain’  <cit> , and onset of a new case of colic was defined as occurring ‘at least seven days after the end of the previous episode’  <cit> .
continuing participation by the veterinary surgeons throughout the study was encouraged by weekly email reminders to submit case information, and regular newsletters on the progress of the study.
the data collection form for each case included open and closed questions covering signalment, history, current management, any health issues, any recent changes in management, clinical presentation and physical examination findings on first presentation, diagnostic approach and findings, and treatments administered on the first assessment, and final case outcomes.
a descriptive system was used to evaluate the severity and frequency of kicking, pawing, sweating, flank watching, attempts to lie down and demeanour, based on previous studies  <cit> .
kicking, pawing, flank watching and attempts to lie down were scored as 0: none, 1: occasional, 2: frequent and 3: continuous.
sweating was scored as 0: none, 1: slight, 2: moderate and 3: severe.
demeanour was scored as 0: standing normally/bar, 1: lower head, no response to auditory stimulus and 2: twitching, agitations and continuous movement.
these scores were summed to give maximum severity score of  <dig>  gastrointestinal sounds on auscultation of each flank quadrant were assessed using descriptors, which were converted to a numerical value ; these were analysed for each quadrant of the abdomen  and summed to calculate an overall numerical score for analysis, with a maximum of  <dig>  <cit> .
if there was an incomplete data set for any variable, the number of cases with available data was recorded as  for each variable.
selection of large colon impaction cases
the data for the impaction cases was retrieved from case records collected for the survey over a  <dig> month period .
inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to identify and define the large colon impaction population for this study.
an impaction was defined as any case with obstructed lumen of the left ventral large colon or pelvic flexure  and was identified by searching the clinical diagnosis made by the examining veterinary surgeon, and submitted findings of the rectal examination for relevant terms.
the complete data sets for each case were reviewed, and cases were excluded if the obstruction was not located in the large colon or if the impaction was considered secondary or associated with other gastrointestinal abnormalities.
final inclusion criteria were horses that were diagnosed with a primary large colon impaction, with positive findings on rectal examination.
if multiple records were submitted for repeated visits for a single case, the physical variables, diagnostic tests and treatments from the first visit only were used in analysis, but the outcome was determined by reviewing all data for that case.
any cases with final outcomes pending or unrecorded were followed up by contacting the veterinary surgeon for further information.
categorisation of data
open questions were used to record the breed of horse, feeding regime, housing, changes in management, current health problems and treatments, and these were categorised into groups based on review of the data and existing literature.
the outcomes of cases were grouped into three categories: ‘simple medical’ cases, ‘complicated medical’ cases and ‘critical’ cases.
‘simple medical’ cases were classified as those that resolved spontaneously  or with treatment only at initial visit.
horses that resolved with treatment at multiple visits or that were hospitalised for medical treatment were classified as ‘complicated medical’.
horses that required surgery, euthanasia or that died were classified together as ‘critical’ cases.
data analysis
the mean, median, mode, range and standard deviation was calculated for each of the continuous variables and percentage frequencies were calculated for all categorical data.
each variable was assessed to determine whether they followed a normal distribution by creating q-q plots and examination of residuals.
data following a parametric distribution is summarised reporting a mean statistic; the median is used in all other cases.
where relevant assumptions were not violated, univariable anova with tukey’s post hoc test was used to compare data for each of the three outcomes.
in cases with non-parametric data, a kruskal-wallis test with pairwise comparison using dunn’s correction was used and presented as an adjusted p-value.
chi-squared analysis was used for categorical data.
the null hypothesis was rejected at p< <dig> .
all analyses were performed using spss version  <dig> .
RESULTS
study population and selection of cases
a total of  <dig> veterinary surgeons registered on the survey, based in  <dig> different practices.
54% of practices were either first opinion equine or first and second opinion equine, and the remaining practices treated a variety of species in addition to horses.
one thousand and thirty two colic cases were submitted over a  <dig> month period.
two hundred and sixteen impaction cases were identified by using the search terms, and after reviewing the data forms for each,  <dig> cases met the inclusion criteria .
selected cases were submitted by  <dig> individual veterinary surgeons.
some forms had data missing from specific sections, therefore the number of cases with data are stated as  for each variable analysis where the complete data set were not available.
categorisation and distribution of variables
thirty seven different breeds were recorded, and were categorised into ‘ponies’, ‘warmbloods’, ‘hotbloods’  and ‘heavy horses’ .
health problems were categorised into eight different themes .
feed responses were categorised into whether or not horses were fed hay, horsehage, straw and concentrate.
housing management was categorised into whether the owner was the primary carer of the horse or not, and whether the horse was stabled, on permanent grass turnout, or a combination of stabling and turnout.
changes in management were categorised into nine different themes .
the date on which each colic episode occurred was grouped into seasons, defined as winter , spring , summer  and autumn .
open questions on treatments were analysed to assess the different combinations of treatments and which specific drugs were used.
treatments were grouped into non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , sedatives, spasmolytics, oral fluids, intravenous  fluids, laxatives, opioids and electrolytes, and others.
case outcomes
case outcomes were available for  <dig> cases.
sixty-three cases  were simple medical cases , two of which resolved with no medical treatment.
forty-four cases  were complicated medical cases , and the remaining  <dig>  were critical cases .
signalment
the population of horses in the study consisted of  <dig> hotbloods,  <dig> warmbloods,  <dig> ponies and  <dig> heavy horses .
there were  <dig> geldings and  <dig> mares.
age of the horses ranged from  <dig> –  <dig> years , and estimated body weight ranged from  <dig> – 750kg .
body condition was reported as thin in  <dig> cases, moderate in  <dig> cases and overweight in  <dig> cases .
there was evidence of association between sex and outcome , with fewer mares having complicated medical or critical outcomes.
the estimated body weight of cases with complicated medical outcomes was significantly greater than that of simple medical and critical cases .
no statistically significant differences in breed, age or body condition between the different outcomes were found.
history
thirty nine of the  <dig> cases  were reported to have previous or concurrent health problems.
five of these had more than one health problem.
the most common problems were current / recent musculoskeletal injury, previous colic episode, and chronic / old musculoskeletal injury .
the frequency of dental care was recorded in  <dig> cases: two horses  received dental care every  <dig> months or less,  <dig>  received dental care every 6– <dig> months,  <dig>  received dental care every 1– <dig> years and  <dig> horses  did not receive dental care.
the date on which the horse was last given anthelmintics was recorded for  <dig> horses:  <dig>  horses had been treated in the last month, ,  <dig>  had been treated in the last two months and the remaining  <dig>  had been treated more than two months previously.
the frequency of ridden exercise was recorded in  <dig> cases:  <dig>  of horses were not ridden at all,  <dig>  were ridden 1- <dig> times a week,  <dig>  were ridden 3- <dig> times a week and  <dig>  were ridden every day.
data was provided on type of feed in  <dig> cases:  <dig>  horses were fed hay,  <dig>  were fed horsehage,  <dig>  were fed straw and  <dig>  received concentrates.
from  <dig> responses concerning housing,  <dig> horses  were kept at grass,  <dig> horses  were stabled and  <dig> horses  were stabled and turned out.
eighty  horses were kept at the owner’s property or on a diy  livery yard and  <dig>  were kept at full livery .
ninety-seven case forms provided information regarding changes in management.
of these responses,  <dig> horses  had experienced a change in management previous to the colic episode, and the most common changes were change in diet, box rest and increased stabling .
there was a variation in the incidence of cases in each season, with the largest number of cases  occurring during winter.
thirty three cases  occurred in spring,  <dig> cases  in summer and  <dig> cases  in autumn.
changes in management occurred more frequently during the winter months, but there was no significant difference in the number of management changes between the seasons.
clinical parameters on primary assessment
based on the pain severity scoring system of 0- <dig>  four horses  were reported as having no signs of pain,  <dig> horses  had mild signs of pain ,  <dig> horses  had moderate signs of pain  and four horses  had severe signs of pain  on initial presentation .
there were no evidence of differences between the total pain scores for each of the clinical outcomes, nor differences for each individual pain descriptor category.
the mean  heart rate for all large colon impaction cases was  <dig> ; heart rate was significantly higher for cases with a critical outcome compared to simple medical and complicated medical cases .
* critical cases were significantly different to simple medical and complicated medical cases
**critical cases were significantly different to simple medical and complicated medical cases
gastrointestinal sounds were reduced in most cases , and total summed gastrointestinal sounds were significantly decreased for critical cases compared to simple medical cases .
there was evidence for reduced gut sounds in the right upper and left upper quadrants of critical cases compared to simple medical cases ; however, there was no evidence of difference between the recorded scores for any quadrants between simple medical and complicated medical cases.
there was no evidence for a difference in respiration rate or rectal temperature between the three outcome categories.
mucous membrane colours were pink in 95% cases and the remaining 5% were red .
pulse character was described as strong in 88% of cases and weak in 12% .
capillary refill time was less than  <dig>  seconds in all but  <dig> of the cases .
critical cases had significantly different mucous membrane colour  and capillary refill time  compared to other cases.
diagnostic tests used at primary assessment
the study inclusion criterion was a positive finding of obstructed lumen of the left ventral large colon or pelvic flexure on rectal examination.
findings on rectal examination were recorded as an open text response, and therefore the descriptions varied.
veterinary practitioners reported that the impaction was located in the pelvic flexure in  <dig> cases , and gas distention was present in  <dig> horses .
nasogastric intubation was performed in  <dig> cases;  <dig> horses had no abnormalities, three cases were reported to have a small volume of reflux.
of the  <dig> cases which had nasogastric intubation,  <dig> received oral fluids.
in  <dig> of these cases, the veterinary surgeons stated on the form that the intubation was performed primarily for treatment purposes.
blood samples were collected in  <dig> cases.
in six of these, samples were not analysed, and in five cases, the results were within normal reference ranges.
no information was provided by the veterinary surgeons on the specific tests run in the cases with no abnormalities.
there were abnormalities in seven cases .
a faecal sedimentation test  was performed in three cases, two of which were positive.
abdominocentesis was performed in two cases, both of which had no abnormalities.
ultrasound examinations were performed in two cases, one of which had positive findings .
there was no statistically significant difference between the outcome of the case and the number of diagnostic tests performed at the initial examination.
treatment used at primary assessment
the main treatment types given were nsaids , oral fluids , spasmolytics , sedatives , laxatives , opioids , electrolytes  intravenous fluids , and other treatments .
‘other’ treatments included anthelmintics, tetanus antitoxin, steroids, controlled feeding and walking out.
flunixin was the most frequently used nsaid , followed by phenylbutazone , meloxicam  and ketoprofen .
detomidine was the most frequently used sedative , followed by xylazine  and romifidine .
hyoscine was the only spasmolytic, and butorphanol the only opioid used.
complicated medical cases and critical cases were significantly more likely to receive iv fluids  at the first visit.
cases that resolved with medical treatment alone were significantly less likely to receive laxatives  at the first visit.
a total of  <dig> different combinations of treatments were used at the primary case presentation.
nsaids and oral fluids, given to  <dig> horses , was the most frequent combination.
there was no statistically significant association between the outcome and the number of treatments used on the first presentation.
discussion
overview of study and limitations of methodology
this prospective study analysed data from  <dig> large colon impaction cases.
the large number of veterinary practitioners that participated in this study meant that the data were obtained from a wide population, and gives a perspective on the assessments and treatments currently used by practitioners on the primary presentation of the case.
the cases covered a wide range of breeds, ages and bodyweights reflecting a diverse population.
disadvantages of the methodology are that with many people contributing data, there may be variation in individual veterinary surgeon’s experience, assessment of cases and use of terminology, and that participants may select specific cases for submission to the survey.
the individual variation in response was reduced by using predefined scoring system for key aspects of the questionnaire, such as pain and behaviour, and gastrointestinal sounds, based on current literature  <cit> .
open questions were used for components of the questionnaire such as management change, rectal findings and specific treatments due to the wide range of possible answers and to allow categories to emerge from the data rather than being imposed by the research team.
there was considerable variation in the numbers of cases submitted by different practitioners, and the study methodology does not provide an assessment of the incidence or prevalence of impaction colic.
it does provide data of how cases initially present, and veterinary practitioners’ primary approaches to these cases.
a total of  <dig> impaction cases were reported in the overall colic survey, however inclusion criteria for this study was primary large colon impactions which were identified on rectal examination  <cit> .
definitive diagnosis in colic cases ideally means confirmation at surgery or post-mortem examination, which is not an option in most cases.
for this case series, rectal examination was used as the ‘gold standard’, as the findings are usually easily identifiable and characteristic  <cit> .
cases with negative findings on rectal examination were excluded as the diagnosis could not be confirmed, but this may have excluded large colon impactions which were not palpable.
other types of impaction, such as gastric, caecal and small colon were excluded from analysis as they presented in small numbers and have a different rate of surgical intervention and mortality  <cit> .
impactions can occur secondary to other conditions, such as grass sickness and small intestinal strangulating lesions, and these were excluded on reviewing case details.
the rectal findings were recorded as a free text entry, and therefore the total of 51% pelvic flexure impactions only reflects the numbers described as being in this location, other descriptions gave less details, such as ‘large colon’ impaction.
most of the cases  with treatment at the initial visit only or recovered spontaneously .
eleven cases were classified as critical, and only two  had surgery.
the surgical intervention rate is considerably less than that reported in previous studies .
this may reflect the lower severity of disease seen at the primary presentation of cases in this study compared to the hospital population study by dabareiner and white  <cit> , or the inclusion and exclusion criteria used.
kaneene et al.,  <cit>  described their cases as impaction / acute intestinal obstruction, but the inclusion criteria for this category was not described.
a number of factors may affect the decision to take a horse to surgery, including the value of the horse, its current use, any concurrent health problems, insurance status and financial constraints or owner’s previous experiences.
consequently, surgical cases were categorised as critical cases alongside cases that were euthanased and died.
history and signalment
history and signalment are used by veterinary surgeons to prioritise differential diagnoses and identify possible risk factors and preventative strategies for disease  <cit> .
the identification of significant risk factors requires a case control cohort or cross-sectional study design.
case series, such as this study, provide a lower level of evidence, but can help identify trends which will assist with the design of future studies aimed at identifying risk factors.
a number of findings from this study were in agreement with previous studies on impaction and scod cases in referral hospital populations, and on non-specific colic cases in the general population.
these included the recent changes in diet  <cit> , an increase in stabling and box rest  <cit>  and seasonal variation  <cit> .
a surprisingly large number of horses  in this study were not ridden; this trend has not been reported previously, and warrants further research to determine whether this is a significant risk factor.
orton et al.
showed that exercise can affect gastrointestinal function by decreasing the dry matter digestibility of feed and decreasing mean retention time  <cit> .
the findings of this study, and evidence from previous studies on the effect of exercise and the increased risk associated with box rest  <cit>  suggest that activity levels may be an important factor in the aetiology of large colon impactions in the horse.
in agreement with other studies, large colon impactions were not limited to a specific breed or age range  <cit> .
there were significant associations between gender and outcome, and bodyweight and outcome; there was no obvious explanation for this difference, and neither association has been reported previously.
univariable analysis was used, and therefore this study did not account for confounding factors.
clinical signs
clinical variables, such as mean heart rate and respiration rate were slightly above normal ranges  <cit>  , but similar to those reported in case series of impactions from referral hospitals  <cit> .
heart rate, mucous membrane colour and capillary refill time at the primary presentation were significantly different for critical cases compared to other outcomes.
cardiovascular parameters are widely used as indicators of disease severity  <cit> , but this is the first study to report that significant differences are present on the first or initial examination of some patients.
this will however be significantly influenced by the severity and duration of the problem, and the owner’s decision to call the veterinary surgeon.
in this study, there was considerable individual variation and overlap between different outcome groups with horses in the mild medical category with heart rates of  <dig> bpm, and one horse with an initial heart rate of 36bpm undergoing surgical treatment, which means that the sensitivity and specificity of heart rate alone at the primary assessment is likely to be low.
this may be due to variations in duration of the problem and the progression of the disease at the time of the first presentation to the veterinary surgeon.
a reduction in gut sounds was a common clinical presentation, with  <dig> % of cases having reduced gut sounds in at least one flank quadrant, consistent with the study by dabareiner and white  <cit> .
in this study, critical cases had significantly decreased gut sounds overall compared to medical cases, and reduced gut sounds in the upper left and upper right quadrants, suggesting that both overall and localised changes may be valuable in decision making in large colon impaction cases.
the majority of horses  showed mild and intermittent signs of pain on this initial examination.
four cases presented due to mild / intermittent signs of colic or dullness, but had no signs of colic on examination by the veterinary surgeon.
the number of horses showing no signs of pain  was considerably lower than the previous referral hospital case series   <cit> , which may reflect prior administration of analgesics or a more chronic history in the hospital case series.
this study also found no evidence for differences in pain score between the different outcome categories.
this suggests that, unlike most other colic conditions, it cannot be assumed that critical large colon impaction cases will show more severe signs of abdominal pain on their initial examination.
diagnosis
rectal examination is reported to be the most useful diagnostic test to confirm a large colon impaction  <cit> , and was the inclusion criteria for cases in this study.
none of the other diagnostic tests consistently produced positive results for an impaction.
nasogastric intubation was frequently performed but was usually associated with treatment administration .
there were positive findings in two out of the three cases in which sand tests were used, and one out of the two cases in which ultrasound was used.
this suggests that these tests may contribute to diagnosis of impactions, but due to the small number of cases in which these tests were used, further data from a larger number of cases is required.
a number of factors may affect the veterinary surgeon’s decision to undertake additional diagnostic tests, including the horse’s temperament, facilities available, practitioner’s expertise, and any financial constraints.
this study suggests that practitioners frequently use rectal examination and nasogastric intubation on the first examination of cases with large colon impaction cases, and rectal examination was the main test that established diagnosis.
treatment
there was a wide range of different treatment combinations used in this study, mainly due to the range of different drugs and treatments available.
recent evidence has demonstrated the efficacy of oral fluids for rehydrating ingesta and resolving impactions  <cit> .
nsaids and oral fluids were used most frequently; spasmolytics and sedatives were also used commonly, whilst laxatives, iv fluids, opioids and electrolytes were seldom used on the primary assessment.
this may reflect the influence of recent research on veterinary practitioners’ choice of treatments, but may also reflect a decision to use less expensive treatments  at the initial presentation.
some treatments, such as spasmolytics and sedatives, have a temporary inhibitory effect on intestinal motility  <cit> , which may be undesirable in impaction cases.
they are however commonly used to improve patient co-operation, and patient and veterinary surgeon safety during diagnostic procedures such as rectal examination and nasogastric intubation.
low doses of hyoscine and alpha- <dig> agonists have a short duration of effect   <cit> , and the majority of practitioners in this study used detomidine and xylazine, which have a shorter duration of action than romifidine  <cit> .
flunixin was the nsaid used most frequently in this study followed by phenylbutazone.
flunixin has a greater analgesic potency and efficacy than phenylbutazone  <cit> , and has no effect on motility which may explain why it was the most common choice.
the large range of different treatment combinations used to treat the  <dig> cases in this study highlights the variation between veterinary practitioners in their treatment approach.
once again, the current existing evidence on treatment is based on experimental studies and referral hospital case populations, and this study highlights the need for evidence generated by and targeted at front-line practitioners.
CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study of primary presentation of large colon impactions in the uk.
it provides the first evidence on how cases present and are initially assessed and treated by veterinary practitioners.
the study confirms evidence from previous research on history and management factors, but also raises new questions regarding the association between exercise and impaction colic.
the high proportion of cases that did not have ridden exercise has not been previously reported, and warrants further investigation.
heart rate and gut sounds were the most useful clinical parameters to identify critical cases on the initial presentation.
rectal examination and nasogastric intubation were commonly used by practitioners.
nasogastric intubation was usually associated with fluid administration.
other diagnostic tests were used infrequently and provided limited additional information in most cases.
the most common treatments used were nsaids and oral fluids, consistent with current evidence.
the study highlighted a wide variation in specific treatments by practitioners, and the need for further research on the efficacy of different treatment options outside of the referral hospital environment.

",400,"BACKGROUND
impactions are a common cause of colic  <cit> , and occur when ingesta causes obstruction of the digestive tract. they can occur throughout the gastrointestinal tract, but most frequently affect the large colon. the location of the impaction affects both treatment and prognosis. caecal and small colon impactions have a high rate of surgical intervention, with referral hospital based case studies reporting surgical intervention rates of 43% of  <dig> cases of caecal impaction  <cit> , and 44% of  <dig> cases of small colon impaction  <cit> . caecal impactions have a high risk of rupture, with a mortality rate of 25%  <cit> . in contrast, large colon impactions usually have a successful outcome with simple medical treatment, but a small number may require prolonged fluid therapy or surgical treatment  <cit> . dabareiner and white  reported on a case series of large colon impactions from a referral hospital population, with 16% of cases requiring surgery, and a survival rate of 95% for medical cases, and 58% for surgical cases  <cit> .

a number of risk factors are anecdotally linked with large intestinal impactions; hillyer et al. identified management factors which were significantly associated with scod  in a case control study of  <dig> horses admitted to two uk university referral hospitals  <cit> .

the current published evidence on risk factors, clinical presentation and decision making in large colon impaction cases is based on referral hospital populations  <cit> , which represent a particular section of the case population. there is a lack of evidence from first opinion practice on the wider population, and on how large colon impaction cases initially present to the veterinary surgeon. the aim of this study was to describe the initial clinical presentation, and the diagnostic tests and treatments used by veterinary practitioners on the primary assessment of horses with large colon impactions.

the study objectives were:

• to describe the history and signalment of large colon impaction cases in a prospective study of the primary presentation of horses with colic to veterinary practitioners.

• to characterise the clinical findings of large colon impaction cases at initial presentation in a prospective study of horses with colic

• to determine how clinical findings of large colon impaction cases on primary presentation relate to final case outcome

• to describe the diagnostic tests and treatments used by veterinary practitioners on the primary assessment of large colon impaction cases.

methods
study population and data collection
this study reviewed case records relating to impaction cases, obtained from a national survey of the primary presentation of colic cases in the uk, undertaken by the school of veterinary medicine and science, university of nottingham . the study was reviewed and approved by the school of veterinary medicine and science ethics committee.

the national colic survey was distributed to  <dig> practices registered with the rcvs in the uk as treating horses, and the launch of the survey was highlighted in the veterinary record and equine veterinary education journals, and through the university of nottingham, rcvs charitable trust and beva websites. veterinary surgeons wishing to participate registered for the survey, and were given a unique reference number to provide confidentiality. they were then asked to submit data on colic cases seen, using an online or paper based recording system. colic was defined as ‘an incidence of any condition signified by one or more indicators of acute abdominal pain’  <cit> , and onset of a new case of colic was defined as occurring ‘at least seven days after the end of the previous episode’  <cit> . continuing participation by the veterinary surgeons throughout the study was encouraged by weekly email reminders to submit case information, and regular newsletters on the progress of the study.

the data collection form for each case included open and closed questions covering signalment, history, current management, any health issues, any recent changes in management, clinical presentation and physical examination findings on first presentation, diagnostic approach and findings, and treatments administered on the first assessment, and final case outcomes. a descriptive system was used to evaluate the severity and frequency of kicking, pawing, sweating, flank watching, attempts to lie down and demeanour, based on previous studies  <cit> . kicking, pawing, flank watching and attempts to lie down were scored as 0: none, 1: occasional, 2: frequent and 3: continuous. sweating was scored as 0: none, 1: slight, 2: moderate and 3: severe. demeanour was scored as 0: standing normally/bar, 1: lower head, no response to auditory stimulus and 2: twitching, agitations and continuous movement. these scores were summed to give maximum severity score of  <dig>  gastrointestinal sounds on auscultation of each flank quadrant were assessed using descriptors, which were converted to a numerical value ; these were analysed for each quadrant of the abdomen  and summed to calculate an overall numerical score for analysis, with a maximum of  <dig>  <cit> . if there was an incomplete data set for any variable, the number of cases with available data was recorded as  for each variable.

selection of large colon impaction cases
the data for the impaction cases was retrieved from case records collected for the survey over a  <dig> month period . inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to identify and define the large colon impaction population for this study. an impaction was defined as any case with obstructed lumen of the left ventral large colon or pelvic flexure  and was identified by searching the clinical diagnosis made by the examining veterinary surgeon, and submitted findings of the rectal examination for relevant terms. the complete data sets for each case were reviewed, and cases were excluded if the obstruction was not located in the large colon or if the impaction was considered secondary or associated with other gastrointestinal abnormalities. final inclusion criteria were horses that were diagnosed with a primary large colon impaction, with positive findings on rectal examination.

if multiple records were submitted for repeated visits for a single case, the physical variables, diagnostic tests and treatments from the first visit only were used in analysis, but the outcome was determined by reviewing all data for that case. any cases with final outcomes pending or unrecorded were followed up by contacting the veterinary surgeon for further information.

categorisation of data
open questions were used to record the breed of horse, feeding regime, housing, changes in management, current health problems and treatments, and these were categorised into groups based on review of the data and existing literature.

the outcomes of cases were grouped into three categories: ‘simple medical’ cases, ‘complicated medical’ cases and ‘critical’ cases. ‘simple medical’ cases were classified as those that resolved spontaneously  or with treatment only at initial visit. horses that resolved with treatment at multiple visits or that were hospitalised for medical treatment were classified as ‘complicated medical’. horses that required surgery, euthanasia or that died were classified together as ‘critical’ cases.

data analysis
the mean, median, mode, range and standard deviation was calculated for each of the continuous variables and percentage frequencies were calculated for all categorical data.

each variable was assessed to determine whether they followed a normal distribution by creating q-q plots and examination of residuals. data following a parametric distribution is summarised reporting a mean statistic; the median is used in all other cases. where relevant assumptions were not violated, univariable anova with tukey’s post hoc test was used to compare data for each of the three outcomes. in cases with non-parametric data, a kruskal-wallis test with pairwise comparison using dunn’s correction was used and presented as an adjusted p-value. chi-squared analysis was used for categorical data. the null hypothesis was rejected at p< <dig> . all analyses were performed using spss version  <dig> .

RESULTS
study population and selection of cases
a total of  <dig> veterinary surgeons registered on the survey, based in  <dig> different practices. 54% of practices were either first opinion equine or first and second opinion equine, and the remaining practices treated a variety of species in addition to horses. one thousand and thirty two colic cases were submitted over a  <dig> month period. two hundred and sixteen impaction cases were identified by using the search terms, and after reviewing the data forms for each,  <dig> cases met the inclusion criteria . selected cases were submitted by  <dig> individual veterinary surgeons. some forms had data missing from specific sections, therefore the number of cases with data are stated as  for each variable analysis where the complete data set were not available.

categorisation and distribution of variables
thirty seven different breeds were recorded, and were categorised into ‘ponies’, ‘warmbloods’, ‘hotbloods’  and ‘heavy horses’ . health problems were categorised into eight different themes . feed responses were categorised into whether or not horses were fed hay, horsehage, straw and concentrate. housing management was categorised into whether the owner was the primary carer of the horse or not, and whether the horse was stabled, on permanent grass turnout, or a combination of stabling and turnout. changes in management were categorised into nine different themes .

the date on which each colic episode occurred was grouped into seasons, defined as winter , spring , summer  and autumn .

open questions on treatments were analysed to assess the different combinations of treatments and which specific drugs were used. treatments were grouped into non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , sedatives, spasmolytics, oral fluids, intravenous  fluids, laxatives, opioids and electrolytes, and others.

case outcomes
case outcomes were available for  <dig> cases. sixty-three cases  were simple medical cases , two of which resolved with no medical treatment. forty-four cases  were complicated medical cases , and the remaining  <dig>  were critical cases .

signalment
the population of horses in the study consisted of  <dig> hotbloods,  <dig> warmbloods,  <dig> ponies and  <dig> heavy horses . there were  <dig> geldings and  <dig> mares. age of the horses ranged from  <dig> –  <dig> years , and estimated body weight ranged from  <dig> – 750kg . body condition was reported as thin in  <dig> cases, moderate in  <dig> cases and overweight in  <dig> cases .

there was evidence of association between sex and outcome , with fewer mares having complicated medical or critical outcomes. the estimated body weight of cases with complicated medical outcomes was significantly greater than that of simple medical and critical cases . no statistically significant differences in breed, age or body condition between the different outcomes were found.

history
thirty nine of the  <dig> cases  were reported to have previous or concurrent health problems. five of these had more than one health problem. the most common problems were current / recent musculoskeletal injury, previous colic episode, and chronic / old musculoskeletal injury .

the frequency of dental care was recorded in  <dig> cases: two horses  received dental care every  <dig> months or less,  <dig>  received dental care every 6– <dig> months,  <dig>  received dental care every 1– <dig> years and  <dig> horses  did not receive dental care.

the date on which the horse was last given anthelmintics was recorded for  <dig> horses:  <dig>  horses had been treated in the last month, ,  <dig>  had been treated in the last two months and the remaining  <dig>  had been treated more than two months previously.

the frequency of ridden exercise was recorded in  <dig> cases:  <dig>  of horses were not ridden at all,  <dig>  were ridden 1- <dig> times a week,  <dig>  were ridden 3- <dig> times a week and  <dig>  were ridden every day.

data was provided on type of feed in  <dig> cases:  <dig>  horses were fed hay,  <dig>  were fed horsehage,  <dig>  were fed straw and  <dig>  received concentrates.

from  <dig> responses concerning housing,  <dig> horses  were kept at grass,  <dig> horses  were stabled and  <dig> horses  were stabled and turned out. eighty  horses were kept at the owner’s property or on a diy  livery yard and  <dig>  were kept at full livery .

ninety-seven case forms provided information regarding changes in management. of these responses,  <dig> horses  had experienced a change in management previous to the colic episode, and the most common changes were change in diet, box rest and increased stabling .

there was a variation in the incidence of cases in each season, with the largest number of cases  occurring during winter. thirty three cases  occurred in spring,  <dig> cases  in summer and  <dig> cases  in autumn. changes in management occurred more frequently during the winter months, but there was no significant difference in the number of management changes between the seasons.

clinical parameters on primary assessment
based on the pain severity scoring system of 0- <dig>  four horses  were reported as having no signs of pain,  <dig> horses  had mild signs of pain ,  <dig> horses  had moderate signs of pain  and four horses  had severe signs of pain  on initial presentation . there were no evidence of differences between the total pain scores for each of the clinical outcomes, nor differences for each individual pain descriptor category. the mean  heart rate for all large colon impaction cases was  <dig> ; heart rate was significantly higher for cases with a critical outcome compared to simple medical and complicated medical cases .

* critical cases were significantly different to simple medical and complicated medical cases 

**critical cases were significantly different to simple medical and complicated medical cases 

gastrointestinal sounds were reduced in most cases , and total summed gastrointestinal sounds were significantly decreased for critical cases compared to simple medical cases . there was evidence for reduced gut sounds in the right upper and left upper quadrants of critical cases compared to simple medical cases ; however, there was no evidence of difference between the recorded scores for any quadrants between simple medical and complicated medical cases.

there was no evidence for a difference in respiration rate or rectal temperature between the three outcome categories.

mucous membrane colours were pink in 95% cases and the remaining 5% were red . pulse character was described as strong in 88% of cases and weak in 12% . capillary refill time was less than  <dig>  seconds in all but  <dig> of the cases . critical cases had significantly different mucous membrane colour  and capillary refill time  compared to other cases.

diagnostic tests used at primary assessment
the study inclusion criterion was a positive finding of obstructed lumen of the left ventral large colon or pelvic flexure on rectal examination. findings on rectal examination were recorded as an open text response, and therefore the descriptions varied. veterinary practitioners reported that the impaction was located in the pelvic flexure in  <dig> cases , and gas distention was present in  <dig> horses .

nasogastric intubation was performed in  <dig> cases;  <dig> horses had no abnormalities, three cases were reported to have a small volume of reflux. of the  <dig> cases which had nasogastric intubation,  <dig> received oral fluids. in  <dig> of these cases, the veterinary surgeons stated on the form that the intubation was performed primarily for treatment purposes. blood samples were collected in  <dig> cases. in six of these, samples were not analysed, and in five cases, the results were within normal reference ranges. no information was provided by the veterinary surgeons on the specific tests run in the cases with no abnormalities. there were abnormalities in seven cases . a faecal sedimentation test  was performed in three cases, two of which were positive. abdominocentesis was performed in two cases, both of which had no abnormalities. ultrasound examinations were performed in two cases, one of which had positive findings . there was no statistically significant difference between the outcome of the case and the number of diagnostic tests performed at the initial examination.

treatment used at primary assessment
the main treatment types given were nsaids , oral fluids , spasmolytics , sedatives , laxatives , opioids , electrolytes  intravenous fluids , and other treatments . ‘other’ treatments included anthelmintics, tetanus antitoxin, steroids, controlled feeding and walking out.

flunixin was the most frequently used nsaid , followed by phenylbutazone , meloxicam  and ketoprofen . detomidine was the most frequently used sedative , followed by xylazine  and romifidine . hyoscine was the only spasmolytic, and butorphanol the only opioid used. complicated medical cases and critical cases were significantly more likely to receive iv fluids  at the first visit. cases that resolved with medical treatment alone were significantly less likely to receive laxatives  at the first visit.

a total of  <dig> different combinations of treatments were used at the primary case presentation. nsaids and oral fluids, given to  <dig> horses , was the most frequent combination. there was no statistically significant association between the outcome and the number of treatments used on the first presentation.

discussion
overview of study and limitations of methodology
this prospective study analysed data from  <dig> large colon impaction cases. the large number of veterinary practitioners that participated in this study meant that the data were obtained from a wide population, and gives a perspective on the assessments and treatments currently used by practitioners on the primary presentation of the case. the cases covered a wide range of breeds, ages and bodyweights reflecting a diverse population. disadvantages of the methodology are that with many people contributing data, there may be variation in individual veterinary surgeon’s experience, assessment of cases and use of terminology, and that participants may select specific cases for submission to the survey. the individual variation in response was reduced by using predefined scoring system for key aspects of the questionnaire, such as pain and behaviour, and gastrointestinal sounds, based on current literature  <cit> . open questions were used for components of the questionnaire such as management change, rectal findings and specific treatments due to the wide range of possible answers and to allow categories to emerge from the data rather than being imposed by the research team. there was considerable variation in the numbers of cases submitted by different practitioners, and the study methodology does not provide an assessment of the incidence or prevalence of impaction colic. it does provide data of how cases initially present, and veterinary practitioners’ primary approaches to these cases.

a total of  <dig> impaction cases were reported in the overall colic survey, however inclusion criteria for this study was primary large colon impactions which were identified on rectal examination  <cit> . definitive diagnosis in colic cases ideally means confirmation at surgery or post-mortem examination, which is not an option in most cases. for this case series, rectal examination was used as the ‘gold standard’, as the findings are usually easily identifiable and characteristic  <cit> . cases with negative findings on rectal examination were excluded as the diagnosis could not be confirmed, but this may have excluded large colon impactions which were not palpable. other types of impaction, such as gastric, caecal and small colon were excluded from analysis as they presented in small numbers and have a different rate of surgical intervention and mortality  <cit> . impactions can occur secondary to other conditions, such as grass sickness and small intestinal strangulating lesions, and these were excluded on reviewing case details. the rectal findings were recorded as a free text entry, and therefore the total of 51% pelvic flexure impactions only reflects the numbers described as being in this location, other descriptions gave less details, such as ‘large colon’ impaction. most of the cases  with treatment at the initial visit only or recovered spontaneously . eleven cases were classified as critical, and only two  had surgery. the surgical intervention rate is considerably less than that reported in previous studies . this may reflect the lower severity of disease seen at the primary presentation of cases in this study compared to the hospital population study by dabareiner and white  <cit> , or the inclusion and exclusion criteria used. kaneene et al.,  <cit>  described their cases as impaction / acute intestinal obstruction, but the inclusion criteria for this category was not described. a number of factors may affect the decision to take a horse to surgery, including the value of the horse, its current use, any concurrent health problems, insurance status and financial constraints or owner’s previous experiences. consequently, surgical cases were categorised as critical cases alongside cases that were euthanased and died.

history and signalment
history and signalment are used by veterinary surgeons to prioritise differential diagnoses and identify possible risk factors and preventative strategies for disease  <cit> . the identification of significant risk factors requires a case control cohort or cross-sectional study design. case series, such as this study, provide a lower level of evidence, but can help identify trends which will assist with the design of future studies aimed at identifying risk factors. a number of findings from this study were in agreement with previous studies on impaction and scod cases in referral hospital populations, and on non-specific colic cases in the general population. these included the recent changes in diet  <cit> , an increase in stabling and box rest  <cit>  and seasonal variation  <cit> . a surprisingly large number of horses  in this study were not ridden; this trend has not been reported previously, and warrants further research to determine whether this is a significant risk factor. orton et al.  showed that exercise can affect gastrointestinal function by decreasing the dry matter digestibility of feed and decreasing mean retention time  <cit> . the findings of this study, and evidence from previous studies on the effect of exercise and the increased risk associated with box rest  <cit>  suggest that activity levels may be an important factor in the aetiology of large colon impactions in the horse.

in agreement with other studies, large colon impactions were not limited to a specific breed or age range  <cit> . there were significant associations between gender and outcome, and bodyweight and outcome; there was no obvious explanation for this difference, and neither association has been reported previously. univariable analysis was used, and therefore this study did not account for confounding factors.

clinical signs
clinical variables, such as mean heart rate and respiration rate were slightly above normal ranges  <cit>  , but similar to those reported in case series of impactions from referral hospitals  <cit> . heart rate, mucous membrane colour and capillary refill time at the primary presentation were significantly different for critical cases compared to other outcomes. cardiovascular parameters are widely used as indicators of disease severity  <cit> , but this is the first study to report that significant differences are present on the first or initial examination of some patients. this will however be significantly influenced by the severity and duration of the problem, and the owner’s decision to call the veterinary surgeon. in this study, there was considerable individual variation and overlap between different outcome groups with horses in the mild medical category with heart rates of  <dig> bpm, and one horse with an initial heart rate of 36bpm undergoing surgical treatment, which means that the sensitivity and specificity of heart rate alone at the primary assessment is likely to be low. this may be due to variations in duration of the problem and the progression of the disease at the time of the first presentation to the veterinary surgeon.

a reduction in gut sounds was a common clinical presentation, with  <dig> % of cases having reduced gut sounds in at least one flank quadrant, consistent with the study by dabareiner and white  <cit> . in this study, critical cases had significantly decreased gut sounds overall compared to medical cases, and reduced gut sounds in the upper left and upper right quadrants, suggesting that both overall and localised changes may be valuable in decision making in large colon impaction cases.

the majority of horses  showed mild and intermittent signs of pain on this initial examination. four cases presented due to mild / intermittent signs of colic or dullness, but had no signs of colic on examination by the veterinary surgeon.

the number of horses showing no signs of pain  was considerably lower than the previous referral hospital case series   <cit> , which may reflect prior administration of analgesics or a more chronic history in the hospital case series. this study also found no evidence for differences in pain score between the different outcome categories. this suggests that, unlike most other colic conditions, it cannot be assumed that critical large colon impaction cases will show more severe signs of abdominal pain on their initial examination.

diagnosis
rectal examination is reported to be the most useful diagnostic test to confirm a large colon impaction  <cit> , and was the inclusion criteria for cases in this study. none of the other diagnostic tests consistently produced positive results for an impaction. nasogastric intubation was frequently performed but was usually associated with treatment administration . there were positive findings in two out of the three cases in which sand tests were used, and one out of the two cases in which ultrasound was used. this suggests that these tests may contribute to diagnosis of impactions, but due to the small number of cases in which these tests were used, further data from a larger number of cases is required. a number of factors may affect the veterinary surgeon’s decision to undertake additional diagnostic tests, including the horse’s temperament, facilities available, practitioner’s expertise, and any financial constraints. this study suggests that practitioners frequently use rectal examination and nasogastric intubation on the first examination of cases with large colon impaction cases, and rectal examination was the main test that established diagnosis.

treatment
there was a wide range of different treatment combinations used in this study, mainly due to the range of different drugs and treatments available. recent evidence has demonstrated the efficacy of oral fluids for rehydrating ingesta and resolving impactions  <cit> . nsaids and oral fluids were used most frequently; spasmolytics and sedatives were also used commonly, whilst laxatives, iv fluids, opioids and electrolytes were seldom used on the primary assessment. this may reflect the influence of recent research on veterinary practitioners’ choice of treatments, but may also reflect a decision to use less expensive treatments  at the initial presentation.

some treatments, such as spasmolytics and sedatives, have a temporary inhibitory effect on intestinal motility  <cit> , which may be undesirable in impaction cases. they are however commonly used to improve patient co-operation, and patient and veterinary surgeon safety during diagnostic procedures such as rectal examination and nasogastric intubation. low doses of hyoscine and alpha- <dig> agonists have a short duration of effect   <cit> , and the majority of practitioners in this study used detomidine and xylazine, which have a shorter duration of action than romifidine  <cit> .

flunixin was the nsaid used most frequently in this study followed by phenylbutazone. flunixin has a greater analgesic potency and efficacy than phenylbutazone  <cit> , and has no effect on motility which may explain why it was the most common choice.

the large range of different treatment combinations used to treat the  <dig> cases in this study highlights the variation between veterinary practitioners in their treatment approach. once again, the current existing evidence on treatment is based on experimental studies and referral hospital case populations, and this study highlights the need for evidence generated by and targeted at front-line practitioners.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study of primary presentation of large colon impactions in the uk. it provides the first evidence on how cases present and are initially assessed and treated by veterinary practitioners. the study confirms evidence from previous research on history and management factors, but also raises new questions regarding the association between exercise and impaction colic. the high proportion of cases that did not have ridden exercise has not been previously reported, and warrants further investigation. heart rate and gut sounds were the most useful clinical parameters to identify critical cases on the initial presentation. rectal examination and nasogastric intubation were commonly used by practitioners. nasogastric intubation was usually associated with fluid administration. other diagnostic tests were used infrequently and provided limited additional information in most cases. the most common treatments used were nsaids and oral fluids, consistent with current evidence. the study highlighted a wide variation in specific treatments by practitioners, and the need for further research on the efficacy of different treatment options outside of the referral hospital environment.

"BACKGROUND
micrornas are small non-coding, single stranded rna of ~ <dig> nucleotides in length that are abundantly found in eukaryotic cells  <cit> .
the complementarity is between seed regions of mature mirnas and their target messengers, enabling mirna-mrna interactions to occur.
these interactions are crucial for post-transcriptional regulation of target gene expression by obstructing the mrna translation or stability in the cytoplasm, and depend on both the expression levels of mirnas and target mrnas  <cit> .
some mirnas are reported as oncomirs which could function as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors  <cit> .
for example, mir- <dig> decreased tumor suppressor pdcd <dig> expression and promoted invasion, intravasation and metastasis in colorectal cancer  <cit> .
mir- <dig> also regulated pten-dependent pathway and affected cell growth, migration and invasion of hepatocellular cancer  <cit> .
moreover, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were significantly associated with cancer metastasis and patients with higher mir- <dig> or mir- <dig> expression levels had worse survival  <cit> .
mir- <dig> was found to be up-regulated during innate immune response and autoimmune disorders as well as in various malignancies.
in addition, mir- <dig> targeted tumor suppressor wee <dig> homolog-s. pombe  and caused gene alternation required for cancer development and progression  <cit> .
on the other hand, let- <dig> decreased cell proliferation and migration of glioblastoma and reduced tumor size in xenograft model  <cit> .
let- <dig> prevented early cancer progression through suppressing embryonic gene high mobility group, a <dig>  expression  <cit> .
metastatic gastric cancer cells secreted let- <dig> via exosomes into the extracellular environment to maintain their oncogenesis  <cit> .
recently, many reports showed that they successfully identified mirna targets using mirna expression profiles  <cit> .
huang et al.
used rna expression data to identify  <dig> high-confidence target predictions for  <dig> human mirnas and further verified let-7b was down-regulated in retinoblastoma and cdc25a and bcl7a were targets of let-7b using qrt-pcr and microarray profile.
li et al.
combined sequence complementarity, mirna expression level, and protein abundance to identify mirna targets for elevating their predictions.
they also found that translational repression of targets by mirnas was dominant mechanism in mirna regulation.
moreover, sequence-based computational methods have been broadly used to predict putative mirna targets  <cit> , and can reach pretty good prediction rate, including cancer-related mirnas  <cit> .
previous report has also indicated that computational prediction should take into account the expression profiles of both mirna and mrna  <cit> .
therefore, the development of an integrative approach that incorporated expression data to facilitate the identification of condition-specific targets of mirnas becomes increasingly important.
microrna can obstruct the translation of mrna, thereby directly affecting protein abundance  <cit>  and pins  <cit> .
for example, yu et al.
analyzed correlations between transcription factors  and mirnas and further discovered that different regulatory networks formed by mirna and tfs were involved in different biological functions  <cit> .
additionally, liang et al.
found global correlation between mirna repression and protein-protein interactions and elucidated the related biological processes of mirna-regulated pins  <cit> .
pins are sets of interactions formed by two physically interacting proteins, which are fundamental to most biological processes  <cit> .
with the accumulation of ppi data, it is becoming increasingly possible to understand the architecture and function of the cellular network by computational approaches  <cit> .
recently, we characterized the global properties of mirna regulation in human pin and proposed possible mechanisms of how these mirnas regulate pins  <cit> .
additionally, previous studies have demonstrated that mirnas can affect specific biological functions which are involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progression through the regulation of a small number of genes within biological networks, such as pins  <cit> .
thus, assessing how mirnas affect pins could facilitate the discovery of potential mirna-related networks and allow the characterization of associated biological functions.
in this study, we proposed an integrative analysis which suggested that mirna-regulated pins could be identified based on the combination of down-regulated mirnas and up-regulated mrnas.
the procedure for mirna-regulated pin identification and analysis is illustrated in figure  <dig>  we subsequently showed that the networks that were modulated by these down-regulated mirnas in tumors tended to be activated in gastric cancer.
among these was the mir-148a-regulated pin, which was involved in metastasis-related biological processes that were associated with tumor suppression.
in particular, mir-148a was shown to inhibit tumor invasion, migration, adhesion and cell growth, and prolonged patient survival.
these findings suggest that mir-148a is not only a potential prognostic marker that can be used for the detection of human gastric cancer, but it can also suppress gastric cancer progression through the regulation of its associated network.
RESULTS
microrna-regulated pins in gastric cancer
although micrornas are known to reduce the levels of their target mrnas  <cit> , expression of a mirna target may not always co-vary, in the reverse direction, with its mirna regulator, due to the presence of primary tf regulation.
a reverse correlation in expression profiles between a mirna and corresponding predicted targets increases the confidence of the conditional mirna-target interaction .
based on these observations, we combined differentially expressed mirnas and target genes, down-regulated  mirnas versus up-regulated  targets, to identify the mirna-regulated pins in gastric cancer.
the mirna-regulated pins were established according to the proteins encoded by differentially expressed target genes and their interacting partners in the human pin.
however, only  <dig> significantly down-regulated mirnas and no significantly up-regulated mirnas were found .
consequently, we identified  <dig> pins that were modulated by  <dig> down-regulated mirnas in gastric cancer.
furthermore, the activities of mirna-regulated pins in normal and tumor tissues, activated or inactivated, were investigated on the basis of the enrichment of co-expressed ppis  in the network .
among the  <dig> down-regulated mirna-regulated pins, 70%  of them were activated in tumors .
on the other hand, 51%  of the remaining  <dig> unchanged mirna-regulated pins were inactivated in both tumor and normal tissue .
considering that hprd pin was incomplete, we randomly removed some proportions of ppis, from 5%  to 20% , and evaluated the effects on the activities of mirna-regulated networks.
most of the mirnas remained activated in tumor  with  <dig> repeated random removal tests , indicating that the results were robust against missing ppis.
thus, we conclude that 16/ <dig> networks are activated in gastric cancer and that these networks are modulated as a result of down-regulated mirnas expression.
therefore, we suggest that the  <dig> down-regulated mirnas act as oncomirs and function as tumor suppressors.
additionally, we assessed the discrimination power of mirna expression levels to classify normal and tumor samples by calculating the receiver operating characteristic  curves and the area under the curve .
among the  <dig> down-regulated mirnas, the one that provided the best discrimination was mir-29c , which gave an overall correct classification of 77%.
moreover, of the  <dig> oncomirs, mir-29c, mir-768-3p, mir-26a, mir- <dig> and mir-148a were found to give an auc of more than  <dig>   individually.
when all the  <dig> oncomirs were combined, the overall correct classification was elevated to 93% .
among the remaining  <dig> down-regulated mirnas, only mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were found to have an auc of more than  <dig> .
when these  <dig> mirnas combined, the overall correct classification was 82%  .
taken together, the  <dig> oncomirs showed greater discrimination between tumor and normal tissues than the remaining  <dig> down-regulated mirnas.
we also investigated the relationship between the expression levels of the  <dig> down-regulated mirnas and survival rates.
the median was used as a cut-off value and as a result, the expression levels for each mirna were divided into two groups; high and low expressed.
the maximum of the difference in survival rates  between high and low groups was further calculated .
our findings indicated that the dmax among the  <dig> oncomirs was more significant  than that in the remaining  <dig> down-regulated mirnas .
these results suggest that the  <dig> oncomirs may act as better prognostic markers for gastric cancer in comparison to the remaining  <dig> down-regulated mirnas.
therefore, we conclude that the  <dig> oncomirs have the potential to suppress tumor biogenesis.
the potential functions of oncomir-regulated pins
a key question is whether the  <dig> oncomirs regulate tumor progression-related biological processes in gastric cancer.
to address this, we developed a pin-based approach to reveal the possible functional roles of mirnas .
our findings showed that union of mirna-regulated targets  and their interacting partners  displayed the most enriched go functional terms and trees on average .
the low coverage of l <dig> genes  , indicated that the functional relationship between l <dig> genes was weak.
however, the high coverage of union genes   suggested that there was a very strong functional relationship between these genes.
additionally, our previous analysis on mirna regulation in human pin  <cit>  also suggested that mirna-regulated genes and their interacting partners jointly showed significantly higher modularity than mirna-regulated genes alone.
based on these results, analysis of regulatory mechanisms of mirnas in the context of the pin enables a more accurate prediction of the potential functions of mirnas.
applying this pin-based approach to  <dig> oncomirs, the enriched biological processes of their regulated pins can be discovered .
it was observed that most of the enriched biological processes were related to tumor progression.
for instance, mir-142-3p- and mir-768-3p-regulated pins were related to apoptosis and cell cycling, respectively.
interestingly, the mir-148a-regulated pin was the only network that was associated with cancer metastasis-related functions, such as integrin-mediated signaling, cell-matrix adhesion and wound healing.
therefore, mir-148a was chosen for the further studies.
mir-148a-regulated pin and its potential functions in gastric cancer
to further confirm the abundance of mir-148a in tumor tissues, we performed qrt-pcr in  <dig> paired tumor and normal tissues and found its expression levels in tumor tissues were significantly lower than those in normal tissues  , which was consistent with our mirna microarray data.
additionally, the impact of mir-148a expression levels on the prognosis of gastric cancer patients by kaplan-meier survival analyses was studied in the  <dig> paired tissues.
patients with high mir-148a expression levels showed significantly higher 5-year overall survival rates  compared with patients with low mir-148a levels .
univariate analysis showed that mir-148a and early stages correlated with better survival, whereas peritoneal and vascular invasion predicted very poor outcomes.
on multivariate analysis, mir-148a retained an independent prognostic power on overall survival  .
a roc curve was also used to evaluate mir-148a as a diagnostic marker for gastric cancer.
the auc was then used as an indicator of the capacity of mir-148a to act as a diagnostic marker, with higher auc values reflecting a higher diagnostic potential.
roc curve analysis of mir-148a showed that it had an auc of  <dig>  .
these results indicate that mir-148a could discriminate between normal and tumor tissues and serve as an effective prognostic marker for gastric cancer.
based on these results, we conclude that mir-148a is highly associated with gastric cancer.
the mir-148a-regulated pin was visualized in figure 2d and the enriched biological processes of this network are shown in figure 2e.
the significantly over-represented go functional terms were separated into three functional groups, including cell-matrix adhesion , wound healing  and cell surface receptor linked signal transduction .
these three enriched go functions suggest that mir-148a is related to cancer metastasis and is likely to regulate these three functions through its regulated pin.
pai- <dig>  itgb <dig>  vav <dig> and itga <dig> are oncogenes and direct targets of mir-148a
four target genes of mir-148a were identified to be up-regulated within its regulated pin, including pai- <dig> , itgb <dig> , vav <dig> and itga <dig> .
to further explore whether mir-148a affected cancer metastasis through its regulated pin, a luciferase reporter assay was performed to analyze the relationship between mir-148a and these target genes.
mir-148a over-expression significantly reduced the expression levels of these target genes, while their expression levels were significantly elevated in anti-mir-148a inhibitor-transfected tumor cells .
we carried out luciferase assay for site mutant to further ensure the correlations between mir-148a and these four genes .
we constructed each putative mir-148a target sites or its site mutation in sequences corresponded to seed sequence of mir-148a into a pmir-report luciferase expression vector  and analyzed reporter assays .
our results showed that the repressions by mir-148a in these four genes were completely abolished.
these results suggest that these four genes are direct targets of mir-148a.
these observations suggest that mir-148a plays a significant role in affecting the biological functions of gastric cancer cells by regulating the expression of target genes within its regulated pin.
in addition to being markers for the detection and prognosis of many types of cancers  <cit> , these four genes have previously been reported to be implicated in the promotion of cell invasion, migration, adhesion, growth and angiogenesis, which suggests a possible role for these genes in the regulation of tumor oncogenesis and progression.
to determine whether these genes played a role in the oncogenesis of gastric cancer, their expression levels in tumor tissues were measured by immunoblotting.
all four genes showed higher expression levels in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues , indicating that they might have potential oncogenic functions and were likely to be key downstream effectors of mir-148a in this network.
the correlation between mir-148a and clinicopathological factors
to evaluate the clinical significance of mir-148a in gastric cancer, the relationship between mir-148a expression levels in tumor tissues and the degree of metastasis was analyzed .
clinical analyses revealed that high expression levels of mir-148a significantly correlated with a reduction in distant metastasis , organ invasion  and peritoneal invasion  .
the relationship between mir-148a levels and all clinical factors was shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  these results suggest that mir-148a reduces the aggressiveness of gastric cancer.
interestingly, our findings revealed that several functions, including migration  and adhesion, were identified within the mir-148a-regulated pin and were also associated with an aggressive tumor phenotype.
this indicates that mir-148a likely plays an important role in regulating the malignant progression of tumor cells.

in vitro invasion assays were performed to examine whether mir-148a suppressed more aggressive forms of tumors.
human gastric cancer ags, sc-m <dig> and mkn- <dig> cell lines were transfected with a mir-148a precursor or an anti-mir-148a inhibitor.
the results showed that over-expression of mir-148a in these cell lines significantly reduced tumor cell invasion, while anti-mir-148a-treated tumor cells showed elevated tumor cell invasion .
to determine whether mir-148a over-expression also affected tumor progression, migration, adhesion and proliferation assays were performed on mir-148a-transfected tumor cells.
our findings indicated that over-expressed mir-148a significantly reduced tumor cell migration and adhesion, while anti-mir-148a-treated tumor cells showed significantly elevated migratory and adhesive abilities .
additionally, tumor cell growth was observed to be reduced in response to mir-148a over-expression , but elevated in response to anti-mir-148a inhibitor treatment .
taken together, these observations indicate that mir-148a can inhibit cell invasion, migration, adhesion and growth, thereby acting as a potent regulator of tumor suppression.
discussion
mirnas are known to function as gene silencers and their expression profiles have been reported to be negatively correlated with those of their target genes  <cit> .
in particular, up-regulated target genes were found to be specific targets of down-regulated mirnas in gastric cancer.
in order to reveal the possible roles that these mirnas play in gastric cancer, the predicted target genes of mirnas were analyzed within the human pin and it was shown that a stronger functional correlation existed for mirna targets that were linked to specific ppi partners than for mirna targets alone.
thus, this method provides us to understand the biological functions of mirnas.
to find out the mirna-regulated pins in gastric cancer, the expression profiles of mirnas were integrated and analyzed within the human pin.
twenty three down-regulated mirna-regulated pins were identified based on their up-regulated target genes in gastric cancer.
among these, sixteen pins were activated.
the results suggest that repressing these mirnas in gastric cancer can activate their regulated pins.
this may be due to mirna-mediated regulation of pivot genes, such as hubs  <cit> , or differentially expressed genes in the biological networks.
therefore, we suggest that these  <dig> down-regulated mirnas act as oncomirs and function as tumor suppressors.
additionally, these  <dig> oncomirs were associated with increased tumor suppression potential and increased survival rates compared with the  <dig> remaining down-regulated mirnas, suggesting that these oncomirs can be effective markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of gastric cancer.
among  <dig> down-regulated mirnas, we found that the mir-148a is down-regulated in gastric cancer and its regulated pin was associated with tumor metastasis-related functions, such as integrin-mediated signaling, cell-matrix adhesion, wound healing and blood coagulation.
these findings were validated by over-expressing mir-148a in ags, sc-m <dig> and mkn- <dig> gastric cancer cell lines.
while mir-148a over-expression led to a significant reduction in the invasive, migratory, adhesiveness and growth properties of gastric cancer cells, mir-148a inhibitor-treated tumor cells enhanced these effects.
lujambio et al.
found mir-148a inhibited metastasis formation in xenograft models  <cit>  and chen et al.
showed that expression level of mir-148a in human gastric cancer was significantly lower than that in their matched nontumor adjacent tissues  <cit> .
these results support our findings, mir-148a regulates malignant progression in gastric cancer.
additionally, patients with high mir-148a expression levels exhibited a significantly better overall survival rate than those with low mir-148a levels, suggesting that mir-148a might function as a tumor suppressor and could potentially serve as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for gastric cancer.
we next ascertained whether mir-148a-mediated down-regulation of pai- <dig>  vav <dig>  itga <dig>  and itgb <dig> expression resulted in the inhibition of malignant progression of tumor cells.
these genes were identified as up-regulated targets of mir-148a within its regulated pin and have been reported to have a high oncogenic potential and are associated with aggressive tumor cell phenotypes  <cit> .
herein, we showed that their expression levels were reduced in response to mir-148a over-expression but elevated in response to anti-mir-148a inhibitor treatment.
overall, these results suggest that mir-148a influences the tumor progression-related biological functions of cancer cells by regulating a small subset of cancer-relevant genes within its regulated pin.
CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, a novel integrative network-based approach was used to demonstrate the dynamic and conditional nature of mirna-regulated gene expression and to discover the potential functions of these mirnas in gastric cancer.
furthermore, this approach facilitated the identification of  <dig> activated oncomir-regulated pins which might be used as possible diagnostic and prognostic markers of gastric cancer.
in particular, mir-148a was identified as a potential prognostic marker in gastric cancer patients, with the ability to function as a tumor suppressor through its regulated pin.
this study not only provides an insight into the mirna-regulated pins that are involved in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer; it also shows that a network-based approach can be used to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic markers of disease.

microrna-regulated pins in gastric cancer
although micrornas are known to reduce the levels of their target mrnas  <cit> , expression of a mirna target may not always co-vary, in the reverse direction, with its mirna regulator, due to the presence of primary tf regulation. a reverse correlation in expression profiles between a mirna and corresponding predicted targets increases the confidence of the conditional mirna-target interaction . based on these observations, we combined differentially expressed mirnas and target genes, down-regulated  mirnas versus up-regulated  targets, to identify the mirna-regulated pins in gastric cancer. the mirna-regulated pins were established according to the proteins encoded by differentially expressed target genes and their interacting partners in the human pin. however, only  <dig> significantly down-regulated mirnas and no significantly up-regulated mirnas were found . consequently, we identified  <dig> pins that were modulated by  <dig> down-regulated mirnas in gastric cancer. furthermore, the activities of mirna-regulated pins in normal and tumor tissues, activated or inactivated, were investigated on the basis of the enrichment of co-expressed ppis  in the network . among the  <dig> down-regulated mirna-regulated pins, 70%  of them were activated in tumors . on the other hand, 51%  of the remaining  <dig> unchanged mirna-regulated pins were inactivated in both tumor and normal tissue . considering that hprd pin was incomplete, we randomly removed some proportions of ppis, from 5%  to 20% , and evaluated the effects on the activities of mirna-regulated networks. most of the mirnas remained activated in tumor  with  <dig> repeated random removal tests , indicating that the results were robust against missing ppis. thus, we conclude that 16/ <dig> networks are activated in gastric cancer and that these networks are modulated as a result of down-regulated mirnas expression. therefore, we suggest that the  <dig> down-regulated mirnas act as oncomirs and function as tumor suppressors.

a key question is whether the  <dig> oncomirs regulate tumor progression-related biological processes in gastric cancer. to address this, we developed a pin-based approach to reveal the possible functional roles of mirnas . our findings showed that union of mirna-regulated targets  and their interacting partners  displayed the most enriched go functional terms and trees on average . the low coverage of l <dig> genes  , indicated that the functional relationship between l <dig> genes was weak. however, the high coverage of union genes   suggested that there was a very strong functional relationship between these genes. additionally, our previous analysis on mirna regulation in human pin  <cit>  also suggested that mirna-regulated genes and their interacting partners jointly showed significantly higher modularity than mirna-regulated genes alone. based on these results, analysis of regulatory mechanisms of mirnas in the context of the pin enables a more accurate prediction of the potential functions of mirnas.

applying this pin-based approach to  <dig> oncomirs, the enriched biological processes of their regulated pins can be discovered . it was observed that most of the enriched biological processes were related to tumor progression. for instance, mir-142-3p- and mir-768-3p-regulated pins were related to apoptosis and cell cycling, respectively. interestingly, the mir-148a-regulated pin was the only network that was associated with cancer metastasis-related functions, such as integrin-mediated signaling, cell-matrix adhesion and wound healing. therefore, mir-148a was chosen for the further studies.

mir-148a-regulated pin and its potential functions in gastric cancer
to further confirm the abundance of mir-148a in tumor tissues, we performed qrt-pcr in  <dig> paired tumor and normal tissues and found its expression levels in tumor tissues were significantly lower than those in normal tissues  , which was consistent with our mirna microarray data. additionally, the impact of mir-148a expression levels on the prognosis of gastric cancer patients by kaplan-meier survival analyses was studied in the  <dig> paired tissues. patients with high mir-148a expression levels showed significantly higher 5-year overall survival rates  compared with patients with low mir-148a levels . univariate analysis showed that mir-148a and early stages correlated with better survival, whereas peritoneal and vascular invasion predicted very poor outcomes. on multivariate analysis, mir-148a retained an independent prognostic power on overall survival  . a roc curve was also used to evaluate mir-148a as a diagnostic marker for gastric cancer. the auc was then used as an indicator of the capacity of mir-148a to act as a diagnostic marker, with higher auc values reflecting a higher diagnostic potential. roc curve analysis of mir-148a showed that it had an auc of  <dig>  . these results indicate that mir-148a could discriminate between normal and tumor tissues and serve as an effective prognostic marker for gastric cancer. based on these results, we conclude that mir-148a is highly associated with gastric cancer. the mir-148a-regulated pin was visualized in figure 2d and the enriched biological processes of this network are shown in figure 2e. the significantly over-represented go functional terms were separated into three functional groups, including cell-matrix adhesion , wound healing  and cell surface receptor linked signal transduction . these three enriched go functions suggest that mir-148a is related to cancer metastasis and is likely to regulate these three functions through its regulated pin.

pai- <dig>  itgb <dig>  vav <dig> and itga <dig> are oncogenes and direct targets of mir-148a
four target genes of mir-148a were identified to be up-regulated within its regulated pin, including pai- <dig> , itgb <dig> , vav <dig> and itga <dig> . to further explore whether mir-148a affected cancer metastasis through its regulated pin, a luciferase reporter assay was performed to analyze the relationship between mir-148a and these target genes. mir-148a over-expression significantly reduced the expression levels of these target genes, while their expression levels were significantly elevated in anti-mir-148a inhibitor-transfected tumor cells . we carried out luciferase assay for site mutant to further ensure the correlations between mir-148a and these four genes . we constructed each putative mir-148a target sites or its site mutation in sequences corresponded to seed sequence of mir-148a into a pmir-report luciferase expression vector  and analyzed reporter assays . our results showed that the repressions by mir-148a in these four genes were completely abolished. these results suggest that these four genes are direct targets of mir-148a. these observations suggest that mir-148a plays a significant role in affecting the biological functions of gastric cancer cells by regulating the expression of target genes within its regulated pin.

in addition to being markers for the detection and prognosis of many types of cancers  <cit> , these four genes have previously been reported to be implicated in the promotion of cell invasion, migration, adhesion, growth and angiogenesis, which suggests a possible role for these genes in the regulation of tumor oncogenesis and progression. to determine whether these genes played a role in the oncogenesis of gastric cancer, their expression levels in tumor tissues were measured by immunoblotting. all four genes showed higher expression levels in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues , indicating that they might have potential oncogenic functions and were likely to be key downstream effectors of mir-148a in this network.

the correlation between mir-148a and clinicopathological factors
to evaluate the clinical significance of mir-148a in gastric cancer, the relationship between mir-148a expression levels in tumor tissues and the degree of metastasis was analyzed . clinical analyses revealed that high expression levels of mir-148a significantly correlated with a reduction in distant metastasis , organ invasion  and peritoneal invasion  . the relationship between mir-148a levels and all clinical factors was shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  these results suggest that mir-148a reduces the aggressiveness of gastric cancer. interestingly, our findings revealed that several functions, including migration  and adhesion, were identified within the mir-148a-regulated pin and were also associated with an aggressive tumor phenotype. this indicates that mir-148a likely plays an important role in regulating the malignant progression of tumor cells.

mir-148a inhibits cell invasion, migration, adhesion and growth
in vitro invasion assays were performed to examine whether mir-148a suppressed more aggressive forms of tumors. human gastric cancer ags, sc-m <dig> and mkn- <dig> cell lines were transfected with a mir-148a precursor or an anti-mir-148a inhibitor. the results showed that over-expression of mir-148a in these cell lines significantly reduced tumor cell invasion, while anti-mir-148a-treated tumor cells showed elevated tumor cell invasion . to determine whether mir-148a over-expression also affected tumor progression, migration, adhesion and proliferation assays were performed on mir-148a-transfected tumor cells. our findings indicated that over-expressed mir-148a significantly reduced tumor cell migration and adhesion, while anti-mir-148a-treated tumor cells showed significantly elevated migratory and adhesive abilities . additionally, tumor cell growth was observed to be reduced in response to mir-148a over-expression , but elevated in response to anti-mir-148a inhibitor treatment . taken together, these observations indicate that mir-148a can inhibit cell invasion, migration, adhesion and growth, thereby acting as a potent regulator of tumor suppression.

discussion
mirnas are known to function as gene silencers and their expression profiles have been reported to be negatively correlated with those of their target genes  <cit> . in particular, up-regulated target genes were found to be specific targets of down-regulated mirnas in gastric cancer. in order to reveal the possible roles that these mirnas play in gastric cancer, the predicted target genes of mirnas were analyzed within the human pin and it was shown that a stronger functional correlation existed for mirna targets that were linked to specific ppi partners than for mirna targets alone. thus, this method provides us to understand the biological functions of mirnas.

to find out the mirna-regulated pins in gastric cancer, the expression profiles of mirnas were integrated and analyzed within the human pin. twenty three down-regulated mirna-regulated pins were identified based on their up-regulated target genes in gastric cancer. among these, sixteen pins were activated. the results suggest that repressing these mirnas in gastric cancer can activate their regulated pins. this may be due to mirna-mediated regulation of pivot genes, such as hubs  <cit> , or differentially expressed genes in the biological networks. therefore, we suggest that these  <dig> down-regulated mirnas act as oncomirs and function as tumor suppressors. additionally, these  <dig> oncomirs were associated with increased tumor suppression potential and increased survival rates compared with the  <dig> remaining down-regulated mirnas, suggesting that these oncomirs can be effective markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of gastric cancer.

among  <dig> down-regulated mirnas, we found that the mir-148a is down-regulated in gastric cancer and its regulated pin was associated with tumor metastasis-related functions, such as integrin-mediated signaling, cell-matrix adhesion, wound healing and blood coagulation. these findings were validated by over-expressing mir-148a in ags, sc-m <dig> and mkn- <dig> gastric cancer cell lines. while mir-148a over-expression led to a significant reduction in the invasive, migratory, adhesiveness and growth properties of gastric cancer cells, mir-148a inhibitor-treated tumor cells enhanced these effects. lujambio et al. found mir-148a inhibited metastasis formation in xenograft models  <cit>  and chen et al. showed that expression level of mir-148a in human gastric cancer was significantly lower than that in their matched nontumor adjacent tissues  <cit> . these results support our findings, mir-148a regulates malignant progression in gastric cancer. additionally, patients with high mir-148a expression levels exhibited a significantly better overall survival rate than those with low mir-148a levels, suggesting that mir-148a might function as a tumor suppressor and could potentially serve as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for gastric cancer.

we next ascertained whether mir-148a-mediated down-regulation of pai- <dig>  vav <dig>  itga <dig>  and itgb <dig> expression resulted in the inhibition of malignant progression of tumor cells. these genes were identified as up-regulated targets of mir-148a within its regulated pin and have been reported to have a high oncogenic potential and are associated with aggressive tumor cell phenotypes  <cit> . herein, we showed that their expression levels were reduced in response to mir-148a over-expression but elevated in response to anti-mir-148a inhibitor treatment. overall, these results suggest that mir-148a influences the tumor progression-related biological functions of cancer cells by regulating a small subset of cancer-relevant genes within its regulated pin.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, a novel integrative network-based approach was used to demonstrate the dynamic and conditional nature of mirna-regulated gene expression and to discover the potential functions of these mirnas in gastric cancer. furthermore, this approach facilitated the identification of  <dig> activated oncomir-regulated pins which might be used as possible diagnostic and prognostic markers of gastric cancer. in particular, mir-148a was identified as a potential prognostic marker in gastric cancer patients, with the ability to function as a tumor suppressor through its regulated pin. this study not only provides an insight into the mirna-regulated pins that are involved in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer; it also shows that a network-based approach can be used to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic markers of disease.

micrornas  are a class of endogenous, small and highly conserved noncoding rnas that control gene expression either by degradation of target mrnas or by inhibition of protein translation. they play important roles in cancer progression. a single mirna can provoke a chain reaction and further affect protein interaction network . therefore, we developed a novel integrative approach to identify the functional roles and the regulated pin of oncomirs.

"BACKGROUND
in the past decade, time-course gene expression datasets have become increasingly available, and have enabled the study of the dynamical behaviors of gene expression and the related regulatory mechanisms, as well as the analysis of the relationships between genes and cellular processes.
of particular interests are the genes that regulate and that are being regulated in relation to the cell-division cycles.
a cell-division cycle is a series of sequential steps which are repeated throughout the lifetime of an eukaryotic cell, and it consists of four distinct phases: g <dig> phase, s phase, g <dig> phase, and m phase.
the cell-division cycle is regulated by a complex interaction of a set of mechanisms which include genes such as cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases .
these genes are known to be expressed periodically with respect to the cell-division cycle  <cit> .
in the genome-wide time-course gene expression studies performed on saccharomyces cerevisiae by  <cit> , a group of genes are shown to be periodically expressed with respect to the cell-division cycle.
since then, other time-course gene expression studies have been conducted on other organisms such as plasmodium falciparum  <cit>  and schizosaccharomyces pombe  <cit> , and similar experiments were also conducted on human cells  <cit> .
the detection of these periodically expressed genes is essential in the understanding of the regulatory mechanism for the cell-division cycle.
in recent years, many periodic signal detection algorithms have been proposed to detect periodically expressed genes from their time-course gene expression data.
it is well known that for uniformly-spaced samples, the classical periodogram can be used to estimate the angular frequency spectrum of the sampled signal.
given a time sequence y <dig>  ..., yn, the classical periodogram is computed as
gn=1n|∑t=1nytexp⁡| <dig>
where j = − <dig>  and ω is the angular frequency.
such classical periodogram has been used in various studies to detect periodicity in experimental data  <cit> .
other algorithms have also been proposed for the detection of sinusoids in expression data.
in  <cit> , a single pulse model is proposed to model the periodic behavior in the time-series gene expression of saccharomyces cerevisiae.
in  <cit> , partial least-squares regression is used to fit the data to a linear combination of sinusoids of various frequencies.
a gene is then represented as a point in a multidimensional space whose coordinates are given by its coefficients for the cosine and sine functions.
the strength of periodicity of the expression of a gene is determined by the distance of the point from the origin.
in  <cit> , periodic time-course gene expression are modeled by yi = μi + βi f + εi, where f is a periodic function which is modeled by a linear combination of cubic b-spline basis.
this approach allows the modeling of periodic gene expression that take forms other than sinusoids.
in addition to periodicity detection algorithms, various clustering algorithms have been proposed to obtain subsets of genes that exhibit periodic behavior.
these methods include support vector machine  <cit> , singular value decomposition  <cit> , and independent component analysis  <cit> .
while the above listed algorithms have achieved varying degrees of success, they are often limited by factors such as being developed for a specific dataset, not being able to provide a ranking for genes, and the nature of the time-course gene expression.
in particular, one problem that plagues the detection of periodic signals in time-course gene expression data is that the samples are typically non-uniformly spaced, which is caused by the cell arresting and measurement methods employed by the experiments.
one approach to resolve non-uniform sampling is to extrapolate a continuous signal from the available samples, and obtain a set of uniformly-spaced samples of the data from the extrapolated signal.
various works have explored this option, such as linear interpolation  <cit> , cubic interpolation on the log of the expression levels  <cit> , and b-spline interpolation  <cit> .
however, errors can be introduced during interpolation, which can lead to inaccuracies in ranking the periodicity of genes.
to modify the classical periodogram so that it can treat observations obtained with non-uniform spacing, it was proposed in  <cit>  to fit the data to sinusoidal signals with least-squares.
the asymptotic distribution of the proposed periodogram is derived in  <cit> .
in  <cit> , it is shown that the lomb-scargle periodogram outperforms methods based on interpolation.
the lomb-scargle periodogram is also used to detect periodicity or to estimate the angular frequency spectrum of non-uniformly spaced biological samples in  <cit> , and it is used to detect genes exhibiting periodic time-course gene expression in  <cit> .
while using the least-squares fitting to sinusoidal functions allows the treatment of non-uniformly spaced samples, it is also well known that the least-squares method is non-robust in the presence of heavy-tailed noise and outliers due to its assumption that noise is independently and identically gaussian distributed  <cit> .
it is shown in  <cit>  that the performance of lomb-scargle periodogram degrades in the presence of heavy-tailed non-gaussian noise.
in  <cit> , robust periodicity detection algorithms using three different estimators – the m-estimator with tukey's biweight function, the least trimmed squares, and the minimum covariance determinant estimator – are proposed to detect periodic genes in the mussel species mytilus californianus.
these robust regression methods are shown to outperform the lomb-scargle periodogram in the presence of outliers.
in this paper, we propose the use of the laplace periodogram  <cit>  as an alternative to the lomb-scargle periodogram for the detection of periodic genes from time-course gene expression data.
the laplace periodogram, which we describe in the methods section, employs the least absolute deviation  fit to sinusoidal functions instead of the least squares used in the lomb-scargle periodogram.
as we will show in the following sections, the laplace periodogram achieves better performance than the fourier-based algorithm proposed in  <cit>  and the m-estimator-based algorithm proposed in  <cit>  when impulsive noise is present in the saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets of  <cit> .
RESULTS
periodic gene detection without outliers
in this section, we compare the periodicity detection performance of the fourier-score-based algorithm  <cit> , m-estimator  <cit> , and the laplace periodogram using two sets of real data.
first, we use the saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha , cdc <dig> , and cdc <dig>  experiments from  <cit> .
the time-course gene expression datasets of these three experiments are obtained from cyclebase.org .
the expression datasets obtained have been normalized to a common scale based on the percentage of the cell division cycle where the sampling occurs.
furthermore, the magnitudes of the gene expression have also been normalized to have a standard deviation of one  <cit> .
next, we compare the performance of the fourier-score-based algorithm and the laplace periodogram using the circadian oscillation dataset for auxin signaling in arabidopsis <cit> .
saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets
we use the same three sets of benchmarks described in  <cit> .
set b <dig> contains  <dig> genes identified to be periodically expressed by the small scale experiments of  <cit> .
set b <dig> contains genes identified in the chromatin ip studies in  <cit> , with  <dig> genes that are in common with the benchmark set b <dig> removed, leaving a total of  <dig> genes.
set b <dig> contains genes identified by mips  <cit>  as ""cell cycle and dna processing"" related genes.
genes that are also annotated as meiosis and genes that are in common with set b <dig> are removed, resulting in a total of  <dig> genes in this benchmark set.
in b <dig> and b <dig>  the genes selected based on their association with other genes that are associated with the cell cycle, or genes that play a role in the cell cycle.
thus, it is expected that most of the genes in b <dig> and b <dig> are not periodic, and should not be detected as periodic by the algorithms.
for each experiment, we ranked the time-course expression of the genes at the normalized cell-division-cycle frequency using the p-values of the scores computed by each of the three algorithms.
since we have very small number of samples, we estimated the p-values of the scores at the normalized cell-division-cycle frequency by a bootstrap method similar to  <cit> , that is, for each gene, we fix the sampling times and permute the expression values.
a total of  <dig> permutations are generated, and for each permuted time series the score is computed.
the p-value is simply the ratio of the permuted sequences that produced scores higher than from the original time-course expression.
by permuting the expression values with respect to their sampling times, we aimed to destroy the periodicity that may exist within the time series.
if periodicity exists within the time series, it is unlikely that a randomly permuted sequence will recover that periodicity, thus the magnitude of the spectrum at the tested period will be reduced and unlikely to achieve greater magnitude than the magnitude of the original time series.
if on the other hand periodicity does not exist in the time series, then neither the original nor the permuted sequences will likely to have large magnitude at the test period, therefore, the possibility of the permuted sequence having higher magnitude than the original sequence is quite high.
thus the lower the p-value, meaning that only a small ratio of the permuted sequences resulted in higher magnitude than by the original sequence, the more likely that the gene is periodically expressed.
since the three benchmark sets discussed above include genes that are known to be or potentially periodically expressed, we will evaluate their performance by searching for the genes in these benchmark sets from amongst the highly ranked genes.
we search within the top k-ranked genes for those genes that are present in the benchmark sets b <dig>  b <dig>  and b <dig>  this search is performed for each of the three datasets, alpha, cdc <dig>  and cdc <dig>  thus we have a total of  <dig> ""dataset – benchmark"" combinations.
for each combination, we plot the top k-ranked genes against the ratio of benchmark genes found in those top k-ranked genes, for k =  <dig> to k =  <dig>  the plots for the  <dig> ""dataset – benchmark"" combinations are given in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>
the figures plot the ratio of periodic genes as indicated by the b <dig>  b <dig>  and b <dig> benchmark sets discovered in a subset of the top scoring genes scored by the three algorithms.
as the subset of top scoring genes  increases, the ratio of benchmark periodic genes contained in these subsets also increases.
from figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  we can see that the fourier score method consistently produces the best performance out of the three methods.
the laplace periodogram is able to detect periodically expressed genes at detection ratio that is comparable to the fourier score for some experiment-benchmark combinations, and less for others.
in particular, the laplace periodogram has the biggest drop-off in performance compared to the fourier score for the combinations of cdc15-b <dig> and cdc28-b <dig>  for the other combinations, the laplace periodogram either has comparable detection performance for all values of k, or is able to bridge the performance gap as k approaches  <dig>  for each of the combinations, the m-estimator-based method achieves the worst performance, with large drop-offs in performance from both the fourier score and the laplace periodogram.
also note that the results in figures  <dig> and  <dig> meet with our expectation that most of the genes in b <dig> and b <dig> are not periodic, leading to a very low ratio of genes from those two sets being detected as periodic.
arabidopsis dataset
for this comparison, we use the experimental data provided by  <cit> , which includes the expression of  <dig> genes in arabidopsis,  <dig> of which are determined to follow a circadian fluctuation in mrna abundance.
total of  <dig> samples of the time-series gene expression is taken for each gene, which covers approximately two cycles of the circadian oscillation.
comparison similar to the saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets is also performed for the arabidopsis dataset.
a total of  <dig> permutations is computed at angular frequency of π. the prediction results for the fourier-score-based algorithm and the laplace periodogram are shown in figure  <dig>  as we can see from the figure, the performance of the two algorithms are virtually the same up to the  <dig> top scoring genes.
for both algorithms, approximately 65% of the top  <dig> scoring genes are confirmed to be circadian according to experiments.
furthermore, the discovery ratio in the top  <dig> scoring genes for the arabidopsis dataset is about 28%, whereas for the yeast alpha-b <dig> ""dataset-benchmark"" combination, the discovery ratio is about 82% in the top  <dig> scoring genes.
it would seem at first easier to rank the gene expression correctly for arabidopsis due to the higher ratio of genes in the dataset following circadian oscillation, at  <dig> %, whereas for the alpha-b <dig> ""dataset-benchmark"" combination, the ratio of known periodic genes is only  <dig> %.
however, the arabidopsis dataset also contains more genes than the yeast alpha dataset, which increases the ranking difficulty.
it should also be noted that the 28% of known circadian genes discovered in the top  <dig> genes is still a much higher detection ratio compared to one from a random ranking, which would on average discover about 3% in the first  <dig> genes.
periodic gene detection in the presence of outliers
we now compare the detection performances of the fourier score, laplace periodogram, and m-estimator on the same saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha, cdc <dig>  and cdc <dig> datasets from  <cit> , but with added impulsive noise to the dataset.
for each gene, there is a  <dig>  chance of having an impulse noise at a random position of magnitude + <dig> or - <dig> in its time-course gene expression, replacing its original value.
note that the range of the peaks of the magnitude in these experiments varies between  <dig> and  <dig>  we generate for each of the three experiments  <dig> such generated datasets with randomly placed impulse noises.
we then perform periodicity detection with the three methods on these randomly generated datasets and averaged the results for each experiment.
however, in our simulations, we observed that the performance for each of the algorithms when ranked using the estimated p-values is no better than if we had randomly ranked the genes.
therefore, instead of ranking the genes by their p-value, here we rank them by using their magnitude instead of using the estimated p-values.
this observation can be explained by the presence of the outlier impulsive noise, whose influence on the spectrum is not removed by the random permutations, thus resulting magnitude for a periodically expressed time series and its permutations do not differ by a significant amount.
the results of these plots are then given in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>
from these figures we can see that with the addition of impulse noise, the laplace periodogram on average gives better detection performance than fourier score for most of the combinations, and only in the cdc28-b <dig> combination does the laplace periodogram achieves worse detection accuracy than fourier score.
however, it should be noted that a lot of the genes in benchmark set b <dig> are not involved in the transcriptional regulation, thus only a very small amount of genes in b <dig> are expected to be periodic  <cit> .
what is surprising in these simulations is that even when impulse noises are added, the m-estimator-based method, which is designed to be robust in the presence of outliers, performs the worst out of the three methods compared.
a closer look at the m-estimator proposed in  <cit> , we see that the m-estimator is based on finding
β˜=min⁡β∑t=1nρ{yt−xitβσn},
where ρ is a symmetric function with the tukey's biweight function as its derivative, and σn a scaling factor.
the tukey's biweight function is given as
ψ={x2for|x|<c,0for|x|>c,
where c is the constant that determines the shape of the curve and the cutoff point above which the residual of the sample and the current fit contributes zero weighting, thus completely removing the contribution of possible outliers that exceeds a certain magnitude.
however, this approach requires a value for c which may vary from dataset to dataset.
the optimal value for c may depend on the magnitude of the peaks and the magnitude of the outliers.
when given an unknown dataset without a benchmark set of periodically expressed genes, it is uncertain how c can be tuned to achieve the optimal result, thus demonstrates a disadvantage of the m-estimator-based method.
note that for both simulations with and without the presence of outliers, we used the default value of c which came with the program provided by the authors of  <cit> .
CONCLUSIONS
our simulation results have shown that the laplace periodogram is a useful tool for detecting periodic time-course gene expression, particularly when the dataset contains outliers and when the sampling intervals are highly uneven.
the laplace periodogram achieves better performance for the saccharomyces cerevisiae dataset when outliers are present, and achieves equal or comparable performances to the fourier-based method for both the saccharomyces cerevisiae and arabidopsis datasets when no outlier.

in the past decade, time-course gene expression datasets have become increasingly available, and have enabled the study of the dynamical behaviors of gene expression and the related regulatory mechanisms, as well as the analysis of the relationships between genes and cellular processes. of particular interests are the genes that regulate and that are being regulated in relation to the cell-division cycles. a cell-division cycle is a series of sequential steps which are repeated throughout the lifetime of an eukaryotic cell, and it consists of four distinct phases: g <dig> phase, s phase, g <dig> phase, and m phase. the cell-division cycle is regulated by a complex interaction of a set of mechanisms which include genes such as cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases . these genes are known to be expressed periodically with respect to the cell-division cycle  <cit> . in the genome-wide time-course gene expression studies performed on saccharomyces cerevisiae by  <cit> , a group of genes are shown to be periodically expressed with respect to the cell-division cycle. since then, other time-course gene expression studies have been conducted on other organisms such as plasmodium falciparum  <cit>  and schizosaccharomyces pombe  <cit> , and similar experiments were also conducted on human cells  <cit> . the detection of these periodically expressed genes is essential in the understanding of the regulatory mechanism for the cell-division cycle.

in recent years, many periodic signal detection algorithms have been proposed to detect periodically expressed genes from their time-course gene expression data. it is well known that for uniformly-spaced samples, the classical periodogram can be used to estimate the angular frequency spectrum of the sampled signal. given a time sequence y <dig>  ..., yn, the classical periodogram is computed as

  gn=1n|∑t=1nytexp⁡| <dig>  

where j = − <dig>  and ω is the angular frequency. such classical periodogram has been used in various studies to detect periodicity in experimental data  <cit> . other algorithms have also been proposed for the detection of sinusoids in expression data. in  <cit> , a single pulse model is proposed to model the periodic behavior in the time-series gene expression of saccharomyces cerevisiae. in  <cit> , partial least-squares regression is used to fit the data to a linear combination of sinusoids of various frequencies. a gene is then represented as a point in a multidimensional space whose coordinates are given by its coefficients for the cosine and sine functions. the strength of periodicity of the expression of a gene is determined by the distance of the point from the origin. in  <cit> , periodic time-course gene expression are modeled by yi = μi + βi f + εi, where f is a periodic function which is modeled by a linear combination of cubic b-spline basis. this approach allows the modeling of periodic gene expression that take forms other than sinusoids. in addition to periodicity detection algorithms, various clustering algorithms have been proposed to obtain subsets of genes that exhibit periodic behavior. these methods include support vector machine  <cit> , singular value decomposition  <cit> , and independent component analysis  <cit> .

while the above listed algorithms have achieved varying degrees of success, they are often limited by factors such as being developed for a specific dataset, not being able to provide a ranking for genes, and the nature of the time-course gene expression. in particular, one problem that plagues the detection of periodic signals in time-course gene expression data is that the samples are typically non-uniformly spaced, which is caused by the cell arresting and measurement methods employed by the experiments. one approach to resolve non-uniform sampling is to extrapolate a continuous signal from the available samples, and obtain a set of uniformly-spaced samples of the data from the extrapolated signal. various works have explored this option, such as linear interpolation  <cit> , cubic interpolation on the log of the expression levels  <cit> , and b-spline interpolation  <cit> . however, errors can be introduced during interpolation, which can lead to inaccuracies in ranking the periodicity of genes. to modify the classical periodogram so that it can treat observations obtained with non-uniform spacing, it was proposed in  <cit>  to fit the data to sinusoidal signals with least-squares. the asymptotic distribution of the proposed periodogram is derived in  <cit> . in  <cit> , it is shown that the lomb-scargle periodogram outperforms methods based on interpolation. the lomb-scargle periodogram is also used to detect periodicity or to estimate the angular frequency spectrum of non-uniformly spaced biological samples in  <cit> , and it is used to detect genes exhibiting periodic time-course gene expression in  <cit> .

while using the least-squares fitting to sinusoidal functions allows the treatment of non-uniformly spaced samples, it is also well known that the least-squares method is non-robust in the presence of heavy-tailed noise and outliers due to its assumption that noise is independently and identically gaussian distributed  <cit> . it is shown in  <cit>  that the performance of lomb-scargle periodogram degrades in the presence of heavy-tailed non-gaussian noise. in  <cit> , robust periodicity detection algorithms using three different estimators – the m-estimator with tukey's biweight function, the least trimmed squares, and the minimum covariance determinant estimator – are proposed to detect periodic genes in the mussel species mytilus californianus. these robust regression methods are shown to outperform the lomb-scargle periodogram in the presence of outliers.

in this paper, we propose the use of the laplace periodogram  <cit>  as an alternative to the lomb-scargle periodogram for the detection of periodic genes from time-course gene expression data. the laplace periodogram, which we describe in the methods section, employs the least absolute deviation  fit to sinusoidal functions instead of the least squares used in the lomb-scargle periodogram. as we will show in the following sections, the laplace periodogram achieves better performance than the fourier-based algorithm proposed in  <cit>  and the m-estimator-based algorithm proposed in  <cit>  when impulsive noise is present in the saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets of  <cit> .

RESULTS
periodic gene detection without outliers
in this section, we compare the periodicity detection performance of the fourier-score-based algorithm  <cit> , m-estimator  <cit> , and the laplace periodogram using two sets of real data. first, we use the saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha , cdc <dig> , and cdc <dig>  experiments from  <cit> . the time-course gene expression datasets of these three experiments are obtained from cyclebase.org . the expression datasets obtained have been normalized to a common scale based on the percentage of the cell division cycle where the sampling occurs. furthermore, the magnitudes of the gene expression have also been normalized to have a standard deviation of one  <cit> . next, we compare the performance of the fourier-score-based algorithm and the laplace periodogram using the circadian oscillation dataset for auxin signaling in arabidopsis <cit> .

saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets
we use the same three sets of benchmarks described in  <cit> . set b <dig> contains  <dig> genes identified to be periodically expressed by the small scale experiments of  <cit> . set b <dig> contains genes identified in the chromatin ip studies in  <cit> , with  <dig> genes that are in common with the benchmark set b <dig> removed, leaving a total of  <dig> genes. set b <dig> contains genes identified by mips  <cit>  as ""cell cycle and dna processing"" related genes. genes that are also annotated as meiosis and genes that are in common with set b <dig> are removed, resulting in a total of  <dig> genes in this benchmark set. in b <dig> and b <dig>  the genes selected based on their association with other genes that are associated with the cell cycle, or genes that play a role in the cell cycle. thus, it is expected that most of the genes in b <dig> and b <dig> are not periodic, and should not be detected as periodic by the algorithms.

for each experiment, we ranked the time-course expression of the genes at the normalized cell-division-cycle frequency using the p-values of the scores computed by each of the three algorithms. since we have very small number of samples, we estimated the p-values of the scores at the normalized cell-division-cycle frequency by a bootstrap method similar to  <cit> , that is, for each gene, we fix the sampling times and permute the expression values. a total of  <dig> permutations are generated, and for each permuted time series the score is computed. the p-value is simply the ratio of the permuted sequences that produced scores higher than from the original time-course expression. by permuting the expression values with respect to their sampling times, we aimed to destroy the periodicity that may exist within the time series. if periodicity exists within the time series, it is unlikely that a randomly permuted sequence will recover that periodicity, thus the magnitude of the spectrum at the tested period will be reduced and unlikely to achieve greater magnitude than the magnitude of the original time series. if on the other hand periodicity does not exist in the time series, then neither the original nor the permuted sequences will likely to have large magnitude at the test period, therefore, the possibility of the permuted sequence having higher magnitude than the original sequence is quite high. thus the lower the p-value, meaning that only a small ratio of the permuted sequences resulted in higher magnitude than by the original sequence, the more likely that the gene is periodically expressed.

since the three benchmark sets discussed above include genes that are known to be or potentially periodically expressed, we will evaluate their performance by searching for the genes in these benchmark sets from amongst the highly ranked genes. we search within the top k-ranked genes for those genes that are present in the benchmark sets b <dig>  b <dig>  and b <dig>  this search is performed for each of the three datasets, alpha, cdc <dig>  and cdc <dig>  thus we have a total of  <dig> ""dataset – benchmark"" combinations. for each combination, we plot the top k-ranked genes against the ratio of benchmark genes found in those top k-ranked genes, for k =  <dig> to k =  <dig>  the plots for the  <dig> ""dataset – benchmark"" combinations are given in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> 

the figures plot the ratio of periodic genes as indicated by the b <dig>  b <dig>  and b <dig> benchmark sets discovered in a subset of the top scoring genes scored by the three algorithms. as the subset of top scoring genes  increases, the ratio of benchmark periodic genes contained in these subsets also increases.

from figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  we can see that the fourier score method consistently produces the best performance out of the three methods. the laplace periodogram is able to detect periodically expressed genes at detection ratio that is comparable to the fourier score for some experiment-benchmark combinations, and less for others. in particular, the laplace periodogram has the biggest drop-off in performance compared to the fourier score for the combinations of cdc15-b <dig> and cdc28-b <dig>  for the other combinations, the laplace periodogram either has comparable detection performance for all values of k, or is able to bridge the performance gap as k approaches  <dig>  for each of the combinations, the m-estimator-based method achieves the worst performance, with large drop-offs in performance from both the fourier score and the laplace periodogram. also note that the results in figures  <dig> and  <dig> meet with our expectation that most of the genes in b <dig> and b <dig> are not periodic, leading to a very low ratio of genes from those two sets being detected as periodic.

arabidopsis dataset
for this comparison, we use the experimental data provided by  <cit> , which includes the expression of  <dig> genes in arabidopsis,  <dig> of which are determined to follow a circadian fluctuation in mrna abundance. total of  <dig> samples of the time-series gene expression is taken for each gene, which covers approximately two cycles of the circadian oscillation.

comparison similar to the saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets is also performed for the arabidopsis dataset. a total of  <dig> permutations is computed at angular frequency of π. the prediction results for the fourier-score-based algorithm and the laplace periodogram are shown in figure  <dig>  as we can see from the figure, the performance of the two algorithms are virtually the same up to the  <dig> top scoring genes. for both algorithms, approximately 65% of the top  <dig> scoring genes are confirmed to be circadian according to experiments. furthermore, the discovery ratio in the top  <dig> scoring genes for the arabidopsis dataset is about 28%, whereas for the yeast alpha-b <dig> ""dataset-benchmark"" combination, the discovery ratio is about 82% in the top  <dig> scoring genes. it would seem at first easier to rank the gene expression correctly for arabidopsis due to the higher ratio of genes in the dataset following circadian oscillation, at  <dig> %, whereas for the alpha-b <dig> ""dataset-benchmark"" combination, the ratio of known periodic genes is only  <dig> %. however, the arabidopsis dataset also contains more genes than the yeast alpha dataset, which increases the ranking difficulty. it should also be noted that the 28% of known circadian genes discovered in the top  <dig> genes is still a much higher detection ratio compared to one from a random ranking, which would on average discover about 3% in the first  <dig> genes.

periodic gene detection in the presence of outliers
we now compare the detection performances of the fourier score, laplace periodogram, and m-estimator on the same saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha, cdc <dig>  and cdc <dig> datasets from  <cit> , but with added impulsive noise to the dataset. for each gene, there is a  <dig>  chance of having an impulse noise at a random position of magnitude + <dig> or - <dig> in its time-course gene expression, replacing its original value. note that the range of the peaks of the magnitude in these experiments varies between  <dig> and  <dig>  we generate for each of the three experiments  <dig> such generated datasets with randomly placed impulse noises. we then perform periodicity detection with the three methods on these randomly generated datasets and averaged the results for each experiment. however, in our simulations, we observed that the performance for each of the algorithms when ranked using the estimated p-values is no better than if we had randomly ranked the genes. therefore, instead of ranking the genes by their p-value, here we rank them by using their magnitude instead of using the estimated p-values. this observation can be explained by the presence of the outlier impulsive noise, whose influence on the spectrum is not removed by the random permutations, thus resulting magnitude for a periodically expressed time series and its permutations do not differ by a significant amount. the results of these plots are then given in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> 

from these figures we can see that with the addition of impulse noise, the laplace periodogram on average gives better detection performance than fourier score for most of the combinations, and only in the cdc28-b <dig> combination does the laplace periodogram achieves worse detection accuracy than fourier score. however, it should be noted that a lot of the genes in benchmark set b <dig> are not involved in the transcriptional regulation, thus only a very small amount of genes in b <dig> are expected to be periodic  <cit> . what is surprising in these simulations is that even when impulse noises are added, the m-estimator-based method, which is designed to be robust in the presence of outliers, performs the worst out of the three methods compared. a closer look at the m-estimator proposed in  <cit> , we see that the m-estimator is based on finding

  β˜=min⁡β∑t=1nρ{yt−xitβσn}, 

where ρ is a symmetric function with the tukey's biweight function as its derivative, and σn a scaling factor. the tukey's biweight function is given as

  ψ={x2for|x|<c,0for|x|>c, 

where c is the constant that determines the shape of the curve and the cutoff point above which the residual of the sample and the current fit contributes zero weighting, thus completely removing the contribution of possible outliers that exceeds a certain magnitude. however, this approach requires a value for c which may vary from dataset to dataset. the optimal value for c may depend on the magnitude of the peaks and the magnitude of the outliers. when given an unknown dataset without a benchmark set of periodically expressed genes, it is uncertain how c can be tuned to achieve the optimal result, thus demonstrates a disadvantage of the m-estimator-based method. note that for both simulations with and without the presence of outliers, we used the default value of c which came with the program provided by the authors of  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our simulation results have shown that the laplace periodogram is a useful tool for detecting periodic time-course gene expression, particularly when the dataset contains outliers and when the sampling intervals are highly uneven. the laplace periodogram achieves better performance for the saccharomyces cerevisiae dataset when outliers are present, and achieves equal or comparable performances to the fourier-based method for both the saccharomyces cerevisiae and arabidopsis datasets when no outlier.

"BACKGROUND
most proteomics workflows from complex biological matrices require extensive sample processing at peptide or protein level to increase identification coverage.
recently, due to its separation capabilities, ease of use and relatively low cost, offgel isoelectric focussing  has become a popular tool to fractionate proteins and peptides by their isoelectric point  prior to lc-ms/ms  <cit> .
the increase in the number of peptide identifications acquired from all fractions compared to the number derived from unfractionated samples demonstrates the value of this technology  <cit> .
the ief separation performance has been illustrated in detail for example by displaying in histograms the percentage of unique peptides identified in each fraction and the number of fractions in which each distinct peptide was found  <cit> .
furthermore, the correlation between estimated and experimental peptide pi has been demonstrated  <cit> .
as an extension of these interpretation methods, this article presents a visualisation tool that illustrates the overall separation performance and displays the spread of peptides in common across adjacent ief fractions.
to evaluate this spread this tool enables sorting the peptide identifications by calculated pi, mass or mascot score.
the visualisation tool also allows importing scores obtained from other search engines and can extract for each peptide different intrisic parameters, for example hydrophobicity  <cit>  or a value describing the length of the ph range where the net charge of the peptide is below a selected threshold.

in order to fetch estimated peptide pis and molecular weights from bioinformatics web sites like  <cit>  or  <cit> , a http page retrieving package was mandatory and implemented in this tool.
we opted for the perl language and its http request module  <cit> .
the graphical rendering requires gnuplot which is a plotting utility originally created to allow scientists to visualise mathematical functions and data  <cit> .
all three pieces of software are freely available on a large number of platforms.
the final output is a one page png , pdf  or postcript file as illustrated in figure  <dig>
the implementation relies on a perl program whose output is a gnuplot script that produces all the graphics.
as inputs the tool reads a tab delimited text file containing the peptide sequences, estimated pis, molecular weights and mascot scores and an optional tab delimited file containing the expected ph ranges for each fraction.
a missing pi value or molecular weight automatically triggers the request of the corresponding information from the web site of choice.
the box plot  and histogram  graphics have been previously presented and generated with other programs  <cit> : these are included for completeness.
in addition this program generates three new figures which have not been previously presented.
figure 1c showing the overall fractionation pattern is a bitmap picture.
a short fixed length horizontal segment of pixels is filled if a peptide is present in a fraction such that its repetition in different fractions creates longer segments.
the colours help count the number of fractions covered by long lines and are preserved in the other two figures.
since figure 1d displays fractions as circles with variable diameters, the colours help align the fractions from the plots above and below.
intersecting points are computed and arcs of circles are drawn to render the overlap  <cit> .
finally figure 1e is built from stacks of variable length horizontal segments correlated with estimated pi values: every peptide is displayed as a centered segment and is automatically joined by a line if detected in an adjacent fraction.
the net charge versus ph titration curve is calculated for each peptide in  <dig>  ph unit increments across the ph range from  <dig> to  <dig> using the acid dissociation constants from  <cit> .
parameters such as the length of the ph range where the net charge is below a threshold value  are then derived and displayed in figure 1e with shades of grey for the connecting lines between columns.
RESULTS
the following data set was used: proteins from a huh <dig> cell lysate were used as a model system; reduced, alkylated and digested with trypsin.
peptide separation was performed on a  <dig> offgel fractionator as described elsewhere  <cit> .
a total of  <dig> fractions were collected and analysed on a nanolc ultimate  <dig>  coupled on-line to a qstar pulsar i mass spectrometer .
data were searched utilising mascot version  <dig> .
<dig>  within the human taxonomy of the swissprot r <dig> database.
identified peptide sequences were extracted together with mass, ion score and estimated pi .
a peptide detected in n distinct fractions is defined as n-spanned, one detected in a single fraction as unique.
a box plot of peptide pi distributions per fraction  shows that average pi values fit reasonably well with expected ph ranges  <cit> .
expected ph ranges for each fraction were obtained from the manufacturer and overlaid with experimental pi .
a histogram that displays the percentage of unique peptides per fraction  helps evaluate the fractionation quality, and is in agreement with reported data  <cit> .
a plot of the general distributions of these spans assists with further evaluation of ief performance .
every peptide, either unique or n-spanned, is given an arbitrary number as an identifier based on the width of its span.
peptides identified in each fraction  are then sorted by their identifier and categorised by their n-span .
the plot visualises the overall fractionation pattern of this ief experiment and how different n-spanned categories contribute to overall peptide identifications in each fraction.
in accordance with previous findings  <cit> , the lowest separation performance was observed in the middle ph range  with figure 1c showing contributions from unique up to  <dig> spanned peptides.
basic peptides  were found to have a slightly narrower span, whilst the highest focussing performance was observed in the acidic ph range  with most peptides not spanning more than  <dig> fractions.
of all peptide identifications,  <dig> % were unique.
the widest span corresponded to a 12-spanned peptide  consisting of a 10-span across the neutral ph range and a 2-span in the final basic fractions, which originated from the abundant protein s-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase.
a total of  <dig> % of all peptide identifications were found to be non-unique , with peptide spans ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  which can be identified across adjacent fractions or contain gaps.
in order to visualise the extent of this spread across all adjacent fractions only , a venn-like summary diagram was designed .
the areas of the circles are proportional to the number of peptides identified in a fraction and the areas of their intersection to the number of peptides in common .
this pairwise comparison reinforces that in the acidic ph region, where circles intersect less, the peptide focussing performance is superior.
for example, f <dig> and f <dig> had  <dig> peptides in common out of  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.
in contrast, f <dig> and f <dig> in the neutral ph range had  <dig> peptides in common out of  <dig> and  <dig>
another data display format was developed to help elucidate the nature of the spread between adjacent fractions .
within each fraction, peptides are first sorted according to their estimated pi, then plotted as short horizontal segments whose length is proportional to their pi and assembled to columns which progressively become wider from top to bottom and left to right.
peptides shared across adjacent fractions are connected by a line.
if fractions f <dig> and f <dig> were identical, their bar length would be equal and the lines in between all horizontal.
because of the progressive increase of the theoretical pi ranges from left to right, lines should ideally join peptides in common from the higher pi range at the bottom of one fraction to the lower pi range at the top of the next fraction, inducing only positive slopes.
this pattern -where observed- is expected for a continuous separation method where discrete fractions were collected, which arbitrarily section individual peptide separation profiles.
however, slopes of connecting lines may be negative and a general trend may not be discernable, when either the overlap is too large or discrepancies exist between estimated and experimental pis.
many peptides especially with neutral pi values have flat charge versus ph titration curves around their pi and hence are less likely to fractionate well in isoelectric focussing  <cit> .
this tool calculates and extracts for each peptide a parameter that describes the length of the ph range where the net charge of the peptide is below a threshold value .
the connecting lines between the columns in figure 1e, reflecting the peptide spanning between of-fgel fractions, are graded on a grey scale corresponding to the length of ph range where the net charge falls within the selected threshold margins .
figure 1e shows that this parameter, an intrinsic peptide property, is a major contributor to the poor experimental fractionation performance around the neutral ph range resulting in insufficient focussing.
this facilitates a meaningful assessment of the fit between the theoretically expected and the experimentally observed peptide distributions across the offgel fractions.
CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, a visualisation tool for peptide fractionation has been developed to support the evaluation of ief data quality and may be implemented in proteomics research or device optimisation.
peptide n-spans across fractions can be determined, pairwise comparison between adjacent fractions quantified and the nature of spread elucidated.
this tool is portable to other platforms  and transferable to other proteomics fractionation techniques such as ion exchange chromatography or other types of ief.

a total of  <dig> % of all peptide identifications were found to be non-unique , with peptide spans ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  which can be identified across adjacent fractions or contain gaps. in order to visualise the extent of this spread across all adjacent fractions only , a venn-like summary diagram was designed . the areas of the circles are proportional to the number of peptides identified in a fraction and the areas of their intersection to the number of peptides in common . this pairwise comparison reinforces that in the acidic ph region, where circles intersect less, the peptide focussing performance is superior. for example, f <dig> and f <dig> had  <dig> peptides in common out of  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in contrast, f <dig> and f <dig> in the neutral ph range had  <dig> peptides in common out of  <dig> and  <dig> 

another data display format was developed to help elucidate the nature of the spread between adjacent fractions . within each fraction, peptides are first sorted according to their estimated pi, then plotted as short horizontal segments whose length is proportional to their pi and assembled to columns which progressively become wider from top to bottom and left to right. peptides shared across adjacent fractions are connected by a line. if fractions f <dig> and f <dig> were identical, their bar length would be equal and the lines in between all horizontal. because of the progressive increase of the theoretical pi ranges from left to right, lines should ideally join peptides in common from the higher pi range at the bottom of one fraction to the lower pi range at the top of the next fraction, inducing only positive slopes. this pattern -where observed- is expected for a continuous separation method where discrete fractions were collected, which arbitrarily section individual peptide separation profiles. however, slopes of connecting lines may be negative and a general trend may not be discernable, when either the overlap is too large or discrepancies exist between estimated and experimental pis.

many peptides especially with neutral pi values have flat charge versus ph titration curves around their pi and hence are less likely to fractionate well in isoelectric focussing  <cit> . this tool calculates and extracts for each peptide a parameter that describes the length of the ph range where the net charge of the peptide is below a threshold value . the connecting lines between the columns in figure 1e, reflecting the peptide spanning between of-fgel fractions, are graded on a grey scale corresponding to the length of ph range where the net charge falls within the selected threshold margins . figure 1e shows that this parameter, an intrinsic peptide property, is a major contributor to the poor experimental fractionation performance around the neutral ph range resulting in insufficient focussing. this facilitates a meaningful assessment of the fit between the theoretically expected and the experimentally observed peptide distributions across the offgel fractions.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, a visualisation tool for peptide fractionation has been developed to support the evaluation of ief data quality and may be implemented in proteomics research or device optimisation. peptide n-spans across fractions can be determined, pairwise comparison between adjacent fractions quantified and the nature of spread elucidated. this tool is portable to other platforms  and transferable to other proteomics fractionation techniques such as ion exchange chromatography or other types of ief.

"BACKGROUND
a challenge facing molecular biology is to develop quantitative, predictive models of gene regulation.
the advance of high-throughput microarray technique makes it possible to measure the expression profiles of thousands of genes, and genome-wide microarray datasets are collected, providing a way to reveal the complex regulatory mechanism among cells.
there are two broad classes of gene regulatory interactions: one based on the 'physical interaction' that aim at identifying relationships among transcription factors and their target genes  and another based on the 'influence interaction' that try to relate the expression of a gene to the expression of the other genes in the cell .
in recent years, researchers have proposed many different computational approaches to reconstruct gene regulatory networks from high-throughput data, e.g.
see reviews by bansal et al.
and markowetz and spang  <cit> .
these approaches fall roughly into two categories: qualitative and quantitative aspects.
inferring qualitative regulatory networks from microarray data has been well studied, and a number of effective approaches have been developed  <cit> .
however, these methods are based on coarse grained qualitative models  <cit> , and cannot provide a realistic and quantitative view of regulatory systems.
on the other hand, quantitative modelling for gene regulatory network is in its infancy.
research on quantitative models for genetic regulation has arisen only in recent years, and most of them are based on classical statistical techniques.
liebermeister et al.
<cit>  proposed a linear model for cell cycle-related gene expression in yeast based on independent component analysis.
holter et al.
<cit>  employ singular value decomposition to uncover the fundamental patterns underlying gene expression profiles.
pournara et al.
<cit>  and yu et al.
<cit>  proposed the factor analysis model to describe a larger number of observed variables.
however, these approaches are based on linear regression, and are not always being consistent with the observations in biochemical experiments which are nonlinear.
imoto et al.
<cit>  proposed a nonlinear model with heterogeneous error variances.
this model matches the microarray data well but it is not satisfying enough in revealing more biological sense.
segal et al.
<cit>  proposed a transcription control network based model and apply their model to the segmentation gene network of drosophila melanogaster.
they reveal that positional information is encoded in the regulatory sequence and input factor distribution.
however, there is still a little bit of dilemma in the model: the activity level of transcription factors is difficult to be measured or to be identified.
actually, assaying the transcription factors' activity state in a dynamic fashion is a major obstacle to the wider application of the kinetic modeling.
tfs' activity levels are difficult to measure mainly due to two technical limitations: tfs are often present at low intercellular concentrations and the changes in their activity state can occur rapidly due to post-translational modifications.
based on the above description, this paper aims to describe the transcriptional regulatory network quantitatively.
in this work, a bayesian inference based regulatory model is proposed to quantify the transcriptional dynamics.
multiple quantities, including binding energy, binding affinity and the activity level of transcription factor are incorporated into a general learning model.
the sequence features of the promoter and the occupancy of nucleosomes are exploited to derive the binding energy.
compared with the previous models, the proposed model can reveal more biological sense.
RESULTS
case Ι: circadian patterns in rat liver
circadian rhythm is a daily time-keeping mechanism fundamental to a wide range of species.
the basic molecular mechanism of circadian rhythm has been studied extensively.
as a real example to test our approach, we considered the dynamics of the circadian patterns in rat liver.
we employ the datasets from almon et al  <cit> .
this experiment was designed to examine fluctuations in gene expression in liver within the  <dig> hour circadian cycle in normal animals.
fifty-four male normal wistar rats were housed in a strictly controlled stress free environment with light: dark cycles of  <dig> hr:  <dig> hr.
three animals were sacrificed at each of  <dig> selected time points within the  <dig> hour cycle.
rna was prepared from livers for gene arrays.
time point designations reflect time after lights on in hours.
for details, please refer to table s <dig> in additional file  <dig>
analysis of the predicted activity levels of transcription factors
to test the proposed model on the above dataset, we employ two important transcriptional regulators of which activity levels indicate the variation of heat signals in a subset of gene circadian network, hsf <dig> and ppara.
in total, we selected  <dig> genes to perform posterior inference of tf activities.
to ensure identifiability, we included three genes that are regulated solely by hsf <dig> , and two genes that are regulated solely by ppara .
the remaining two genes are jointly regulated by hsf <dig> and ppara.
these genes were chosen since they exhibit the largest variance in the microarray time course, and hence are likely to provide a cleaner representation of the output of the system.
the inferred tfs' activity levels are shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  both inferred tf profiles show a noisy periodic behaviour  <cit> .
figure  <dig> gives the values of the parameters ki for the four selected circadian genes .
the green column represents the response k <dig> to hsf <dig> alone, the red column is the response k <dig> to ppara alone and the black column represents the joint response k <dig>  it can be seen that, for gene, hspa <dig>  the model predicts a clear activation by hsfl alone, which is consistent with the experimental conclusion from yan et al  <cit> .
the black columns of hsp90aa <dig> and hspa1b demonstrate that the model predicts a significant combinatorial activation which can be verified by mutagenetic techniques, i.e.
by knocking out one of the tfs.
the biological sense of kinetic parameters
case ii: a yeast synthetic network for in vivo assessment
validation of gene regulation network  inference methods has traditionally been done using in silico networks.
however, depending on how realistic the choice of an in silico model is, this kind of validation approach has obvious limitations.
to our knowledge, rarely the underlying model from which artificial/simulated data is generated is realistic enough.
real biological networks are fairly complex chemical reaction network models.
in simulation setting one typically adds noise on top of a hypothetical simulation model, but the noise characteristics may not be realistic enough.
also, simulation models tend to be overly simplistic when compared to e.g.
real gene regulatory networks.
data measured from a real biological system is, real.
to overcome these problems, we use the irma network to evaluate out model.
the irma network is a synthetically constructed grn in the saccharomyces cerevisiae genome  <cit> , which is designed to be maximally independent in such a way that genes in the network are not regulated by genes outside of the network .
however, genes in the irma network may regulate other genes in the genome.
the network consists of five genes and there are positive and negative feedback loops and one protein to protein interaction, shown as figure  <dig>  although the irma network contains only five genes, there are studies suggesting that the performance on smaller networks typically generalize to larger networks  <cit> .
the data samples were collected every  <dig> min up to  <dig> hr in five independent experiments for the switch-on state, and every  <dig> min up to  <dig> hr in four independent experiments for the switch-off state.
for details on the construction of the network and experimental procedures, we refer to  <cit> .
one of the purposes of the irma network is to provide a realistic benchmark set for computational studies by providing mrna-level measurements from a known grn.
to our knowledge, the irma network and dataset are the first of a kind that are meant for validation purposes.
besides, we assume that mrna decay rates may be gene-specific, but remain constant in time  <cit> .
the sequences of all promoters are retrieved from scpd and sgd database.
the scanning region ranges from - <dig> to + <dig> bp of each target gene.
analysis of the predicted activity levels of transcription factors
to evaluate whether the proposed model can effectively learn the tfs' activity level and the regulation type, we first evaluate the model using the switch-on time series data.
the inferred tfs' activity levels are shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  both inferred tf profiles show a noisy switch-on behavior.
figure  <dig> gives the values of the parameters ki for the five target genes.
the green column represents the response to the first regulator alone, the red column is the response to the second regulator alone and the black column represents the joint response, k <dig>  it can be seen that, for gene, gal <dig>  the model predicts a clear activation by swi <dig> which is consistent with the experimental conclusion  <cit> .
for gene cbf <dig>  the red downward column indicates that ash <dig> behaves as a repressor, which is verified in  <cit> .
the black column of cbf <dig> demonstrates that the model predicts a significant combinatorial regulation  <cit> .
analysis of the kinetic parameters
for comparison, we also evaluate the model using the switch-off data.
figure  <dig> shows the fit of the model to the observed data at each time-point for both the switch-on case and switch-off case.
discussion
in this study, two real-world microarray datasets were exploited two evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model.
comparison shows that the kinetic parameters obtained by our method have smaller variance than that of barenco et al.
<cit> .
one reason is that the proposed model provides a principled method for the incorporation of prior biological knowledge.
this may be in the form of suitable ranges for kinetic parameters, known kinetic parameter values and suitable distributions on measurement noise.
besides, it is possible for the proposed model to circumvent the need for expensive sampling-based inference and a tfa profile can be inferred over all time, rather than just at the discrete time-points at which expression was measured.
the bayesian inference based model of transcription rates and regulator activity levels allows us to handle these biologically relevant quantities despite the indirect measurement of the former and the lack of measurements of the latter.
it also allows us to handle the inherently noisy measurement in a principled way.
however, the proposed model still abstracts away some of the explicit processes that generate the actual observed expression data.
a more explicit modelling of these will provide a more principled treatment of different sources of noise in the data.
furthermore, this model does not handle directly the upstream events that affect regulator activity.
in fact, the current model is an open loop system, such that the regulation of regulator activity is itself viewed as exogenous to the system.
by developing a richer modeling language we may capture more complex reaction models, model the upstream regulation of activity levels, and identify systems that involve feedback mechanisms and signalling networks.
post-transcriptional modification model  have been previously used to model tf activities  <cit> ; in that work, further dependencies were included between tf mrna expression levels and their predicted activities, which enabled to predict possible post-transcriptional modifications in tfs.
naturally, it should be possible to combine both our approach and their approach to give a model capable of simultaneously inferring tf activities, combinatorial interactions and post transcriptional regulations.
CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we have proposed a computational model to reverse engineer simultaneously both the activity of tfs and the logical structure of promoters by integrating multiple sources of knowledge, including time-series gene expression data, tfs' binding information and sequence features of promoters.
the approach relies on a detailed model of transcription, which is an approximation to the michaelis-menten model from classical enzyme kinetics, and therefore should be able to capture accurately the effects that changes in tf activity have on gene expression dynamics.
we testify the proposed approach on two real-world microarray datasets.
experimental results show that the proposed model can effectively identify the parameters and the activity level of tf.
moreover, the kinetic parameters introduced in the proposed model can reveal more biological sense than previous models can do.

"BACKGROUND
the gene expression changes occurring in the surface tissues of fish after rhabdoviral natural infections have not been described yet.
in the most studied infection-by-injection models, internal organs are affected by the infection before surface tissues, while the contrary is expected to occur in the infection-by-immersion models which mimick the natural route of infection.
under laboratory controlled conditions, trout rhabdoviral infections produce 100% mortalities after infection-by-injection, while only 60-80% wild type  <cit>  or 5% rhabdoviral-resistant  <cit>  mortalities could be obtained after infection-by-immersion.
these results suggested that the natural route of infection is an important determinant for the final outcome of fish rhabdoviral diseases.
some infection-by-immersion studies using recombinant viruses showed that the fin bases, skin and other fish epithelial surfaces were the earliest sites of replication for rhabdoviral  <cit>  and other viral  <cit>  infections.
furthermore, after viral haemorrhagic septicemia  infection, zebrafish showed early hemorrhages in the skin, fin bases, mouth and gills long before dying  <cit> .
the fin bases therefore, were chosen for this study as a representative fish surface tissue and because they were easy and reproducibly harvested.
from the fish surface tissues, rhabdoviruses spread to the fish internal organs  <cit> .
therefore, internal organs  were also chosen as potential tissue responders to delayed infection-by-immersion and to compare their responses with those obtained at the fin bases.
the zebrafish danio rerio was chosen because the sequence of their genome is well advanced and ~ <dig> k annotated quantitative polymerase chain reaction  arrays or partially annotated oligo microarrays are available.
furthermore, zebrafish are susceptible to several rhabdoviruses of fish farmed species  <cit> , whose infection severity can be modulated by viral dosage and temperature.
vhsv was selected among the other rhabdoviruses because of their importance in fish aquaculture and because protection and adaptative immune responses to vhsv-challenges after vaccination have been demonstrated in cold-acclimatized zebrafish  <cit> .
lower than physiological optimal temperatures induce a delay on fish adaptative immune responses while some of the innate immune responses  are up regulated  <cit> .
however, little is known about the detailed gene regulation implicated in innate responses in fish when temperature decreases and viral susceptibility becomes maximal, such as it occurs during most rhabdoviral natural outbreaks  <cit> .
therefore, the differential  protein and immune-related transcript expression of zebrafish fin tissues after vhsv infection-by-immersion were the focus of this work.
the results demonstrated the important variability associated with in vivo fish experiments.
at the protein level and despite variability, vhsv-infection changed the differential expression levels of most fin enzymes of the glycolytic pathway and their cytoskeleton proteins.
however, because most immune-related proteins remained undetectable by the proteomic approach, their rna expression levels need to be also investigated.
at the transcriptional level, vhsv-infection increased the differential expression of several fin immune-related genes while decreased those of the internal organs.
while these findings shed some light upon the earliest effects of vhsv infection-by-immersion at the molecular level, some of the newly described genes might even be used for adjuvant testing purposes.
RESULTS
infection-by-immersion of cold-acclimatized zebrafish with vhsv
cold acclimatized zebrafish infected-by-immersion in  <dig> ×  <dig> focus forming units  of vhsv per ml, at 14°c induced mortalities of 80-100%.
under those conditions, most zebrafish showed the first external hemorrhages around the mouth and gills, in the lateral skin or in the fin bases, 5- <dig> days post infection .
although every individual zebrafish followed a different time course of vhsv spreading to its body until its death, 2-days after infection-by-immersion there were no mortalities in any of the different experiments performed .
the time courses of subsequent mortalities  were delayed a few days  compared to those previously reported in trout  <cit> .
previous zebrafish acclimatation to 14°c during  <dig> days was required for the vhsv infection to cause high mortalities, confirming previous results  <cit> .
reduction of the acclimatation time from  <dig> to  <dig> days, reduced to 10-30% the mortalities .
two days after infection-by-immersion, vhsv n mrnas levels corresponded to  <dig>  ×  <dig> ffu of vhsv in the fins and  <dig>  ×  <dig> ffu  in the organs  per individual zebrafish  .
studies on the protein and transcript differential changes occurring on zebrafish fins or organs, 2-days after infection-by-immersion at high mortality conditions were then undertaken.
protein changes in the zebrafish fins induced by vhsv infection by 2d-dige
the characteristic protein profile of zebrafish fins showed three major multiple spot regions between 48- <dig> kda distributed around isoelectric points  of ~ <dig>  their yellow color confirmed that their levels remained unchanged after vhsv infection.
most of the differentially expressed protein spots  were between  <dig> and  <dig> kda.
the most differentially expressed spots  were excised, in-gel digested with trypsin, and analyzed by mass spectrometry .
protein identifications summarized in table  <dig> showed that the characteristic major yellow spots corresponded to keratins , cytokeratins  and actins  .

nf, not found annotated in the microarray.
most of the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway increased upon vhsv infection, such as fructose-bisphophate aldolase, triose phosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , phosphopyruvate dehydratase  and lactate dehydrogenase.
also an atp binding protein was decreased, while an atp synthase was increased, most probably contributing with all the above enzymes to atp accumulation in the vhsv-infected fins .
the levels of different types of keratins specific for epithelial cells were maintained after vhsv infection  while others such as keratin  <dig>  type i and type ii cytokeratins increased.
skeletal α-actin, α-tropomiosin, kinesin and filament-actin  crosslinking transgellin decreased after vhsv infection suggesting the reduction of f-actin networks.
myosins, capg, scinderin, cyclase-associated protein- <dig>  dynamin and semaphorin also changed after vhsv infection.
annexins  a1a and 1a increased while annexins a5b and 5b decreased with vhsv infection.
proteins implicated in haematopoiesis such as transferrins and hemopexins increased, as probably demanded by the hemorrhages caused by vhsv infection.
increase of  <dig> isoforms of fgf <dig>  a protein implicated in fin regeneration were also detected in one of the experiments .
vhsv proteins were searched among those spots located in their expected molecular weight/pi regions on the  <dig> d gels.
however, none could be detected, most probably due to their relative low abundance among the fin proteins 2-days after infection.
among the few immune-related proteins which could be detected by this approach, only the high mobility group binding  <dig>  protein and the guanine nucleotide binding protein β polypeptide  <dig>  could be detected.
both increased after vhsv infection.
because of the scarce number of immune-related proteins detected by the 2d-dige experiments, most probably due to their low concentrations in fins, studies on the vhsv-induced transcripts by using immune-related q-pcr arrays and hybridization to oligo microarrays were then undertaken.
immune-related transcripts changing in fins and organs after vhsv infection analyzed by q-pcr arrays
differential expression with >2-fold and p <  <dig>  estimated by q-pcr arrays showed that while  <dig> immune-related transcripts increased in fins, only  <dig>  increased in organs .
furthermore, maximal differential transcript levels of any p value were of ~36-fold in fins, while only of ~ <dig> fold in organs .
for each experiment,  <dig> zebrafish were infected with  <dig> ×  <dig> ffu of vhsv/ml at 14°c while other  <dig> zebrafish remained non-infected.

major histocompatibility complex class i  transcripts, one of the induced host molecules identified in most infections-by-injection, increased more than 3-fold in the fins, however, it was not increased in organs .
other differentially increased transcripts in fins which were not increased in organs were those corresponding to the secreted immunoglobulin domain  <dig>  of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and macrophage stimulating factor .
among all the cluster differentiation  antigen transcripts present in the immune-related probes , only cd <dig> and cd  <dig> were differentially increased in fins but not in organs .
among the transcripts corresponding to the interleukin  genes studied , only il <dig> d and its related il <dig>  were differentially increased in fins.
some of the other il <dig> family members such as il17a/f <dig> and il <dig> d were also increased in fins, however, with p >  <dig>  .
there were not similar increases in organs for any of the studied il transcripts .
interferon  transcripts, which increased > 2-fold in zebrafish organs after vhsv infection-by-injection in a previous report  <cit> , did not changed at the fins/organs after infection-by-immersion .
however, the primers designed to estimate ifn <dig> by the q-pcr gene expression assay , only amplified the virus-independent ifn <dig> isoform which remains unaltered upon viral infection  <cit> .
defensin β  increased in organs and fins  but it was eliminated from table  <dig>  because both of their transcript levels showed p >  <dig> .
no immune-related gene transcripts decreased >  <dig> fold in fins , while of the  <dig> transcripts that decreased > 2-fold in organs, only crfb <dig> have p <  <dig>  .
immune-related transcript changes in fins/organs after vhsv infection by hybridization to oligo microarrays
the signal intensities obtained after hybridization of samples from zebrafish fins and organs to microarrays, ranged from  <dig> to ~ <dig>  fluorescence units.
differential expression changes were then calculated by comparing vhsv-infected versus non-infected samples.
of the  <dig> oligo sequences present in the zebrafish microarray latest version,  <dig>  or  <dig>  in fins or organs, respectively, showed > 3-fold increases .
on the other hand,  <dig> % or  <dig> % in fins or organs, respectively showed a significant departure from the null hypothesis when t-tests were performed at the p <  <dig>  significance level.
of the  <dig> immune-related sequences annotated in the zebrafish microarray,  <dig>  in fins and  <dig>  in organs increased > 2-fold with p <  <dig>  after vhsv infection.
in contrast,  <dig>  sequences in fins and  <dig>  in organs decreased > 2-fold after vhsv infection .
for each experiment,  <dig> zebrafish were infected with  <dig> ×  <dig> ffu of vhsv/ml at 14°c while other  <dig> zebrafish remained non-infected.
rna was extracted from the fins or organs 2-days after vhsv or mock infection, labeled with cy <dig> and hybridized to the microarrays.
the  <dig> immune-related selected sequences from the 4x <dig> k microarray  from zebrafish were selected and their data analyzed.
in each microarray,  <dig> assays of rplp <dig> gene were used for normalization.
the mean and p  were then calculated from  <dig> experiments.
the transcripts from either fins and/or organs with >2-fold and p <  <dig>  changes were first tabulated and then the rest of the table was completed with their corresponding calculated fold values in organs and/or fins, respectively.

figure  <dig> shows the representation of the means of all the immune-related genes.
the genes corresponding to the proteins identified in the proteomic analysis were searched in the microarray data and a column with that data added to table  <dig>  because they were present in several copies per microarray, the averages of their differential transcriptional levels were calculated and represented.
although some of the increased  and decreased  proteins showed a similar change in their differential transcript levels, the rest of protein changes did not correlate with those of their corresponding transcripts.
many complement transcripts  including those increased in the q-pcr arrays , increased in fins .
only the c <dig> transcripts increased in both fins and organs , as confirmed by  <dig> different oligo sequences of the same gene present in the microarray.

increased c1q transcripts  were only found increased in organs but with p >  <dig>  .
of the  <dig> major histocompatibility complex  sequences present in the annotated immune-related microarray sequences, only those corresponding to the mhc1uaa and mhc1ze genes in fins  were increased.
however, most of their lower folds and p >  <dig>  values resulted from their higher folds in only one of the experiments .
previously described up-regulated typical gene markers of viral infection-by-injection, il1b  or tnfa  were found among the genes increased in fins or organs  but with p >  <dig> .
two different oligo sequences from the hepcidin antimicrobial peptide  <dig>  gene detected similarly increased transcripts in the fins but not in organs .
some of the  <dig> transcripts corresponding to immunoglobulin-related genes , specially those corresponding to the heavy chain gene, increased in the fins   and in the organs .
among the transcripts increased, those corresponding to the newly described immunoglobulin z, both at the fins  and at the organs  might be relevant to mucosal immunity as could be expected from a natural route of infection.
discussion
major protein changes at the fins after vhsv infection
the differential expression  of fin proteins, identified their most abundant proteins with high variations among experiments .
individual fish variation in the development of vhsv infection and on the different amounts of muscle sampled at the bases of the fins , different yields of the fin protein precipitation techniques and 2d-dige technical irreproducibility, all contributed to the wide quantitative differences.
nevertheless, some differential abundances of the major protein components could be detected.
for instance, most of the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway were differentially increased .
similar enzymes were also found among the cdna library genes from hrv-infected leukocytes of japanese flounder  <cit> .
in contrast, no enzyme transcripts related to the glycolytic pathway increased in organs after hrv  <cit>  or ihnv  <cit>  infection-by-injection, nor in dna vaccination-by-injection with the g gene of hrv  <cit> , vhsv  <cit>  or ihnv  <cit> .
many proteins classified and/or related to the cytoskeleton , vesicle trafficking and/or fin regeneration   <cit>  were differentially expressed .
at least some of those might reflect fin regeneration attempts to compensate for their destruction as vhsv infection progresses.
similar proteins were also found among the cdna obtained from the hrv-infected leukocytes of the japanese flounder mentioned above  <cit> .
increases of hmgb <dig> protein levels  were detected in vhsv-infected fins.
however, their transcript levels were unchanged .
similarly, hmgb <dig> transcript profiles after intramuscular injection of the ihnv g gene in trout showed that none of their  <dig> cdnas microarray probes changed  <cit> .
nevertheless, transcripts of hmgb <dig> were identified among the hrv-infected leukocytes of japanese flounder  <cit>  and a  <dig> -fold increase of hmgb2-like  <dig> kidney transcripts was found in ihnv-infected trout  .
in mammalians, hmgb <dig> is an abundant nuclear protein being secreted upon bacterial infections to enhance tissue repair, attract inflammatory cells, induce chemokines, and activate dendritic cells.
all these properties make hmgb <dig> an important intermediate between innate and adaptative responses  <cit>  and a vaccine adjuvant candidate  <cit> .
most recently, secreted hmgb <dig> from dendritic cells was demonstrated during dengue viral replication  <cit>  and it has also been tested as a vaccine adjuvant  <cit> .
the potential use of hmgb <dig> as an adjuvant for fish vaccines, therefore, might deserve further attention.
the differential expression of some fin proteins  showed a parallel variation in their transcript levels .
however, in most of them, the protein differential expression changes did not correlate with their corresponding transcript changes, suggesting that regulation of their expression was not at the transcriptional level, at least in 2-day vhsv-infected fins.
although correlation of gene and protein expression levels have been found in some plants  <cit> , most studies found no correlation, including a recent report on individual e. coli cells  <cit> .
on the other hand, exclusive post-translational regulation of enzymes of the glycolytic pathway has been reported  <cit> , which could explain some of the data found here.
although, similar studies are still scarce, correlation values comparing gene/protein expression levels in several systems were very low  <cit> , and varied with the protein relative abundance and their half-life time.
most correlation values showed that mrna might be a poor indicator of protein expression.
study of mrna levels, is justified when there is no other way to study gene expression levels, as in the present case where the vhsv immune-related proteins cannot be detected by the proteomic approach.
transcript level changes of immune-related genes at the fins and organs after vhsv infection
the number of the  <dig> immune-related transcripts differentially increased were higher in fins than in organs as estimated by q-pcr.
similar results were obtained with the  <dig> immune-related transcripts estimated by microarray hybridization.
in contrast, the number of differentially decreased transcripts were higher in organs than in fins .
it seems likely that 2-days after infection-by-immersion, vhsv has not yet caused an increased differential response from the internal organs, contrary to what has been described for infection-by-injection in other fish models  <cit> .
the lower numbers of increased transcripts seen in organs compared to fins may be due to a delay in virus tissue infiltration.
thus, the reason for the major differences seen in transcription may be solely because  <dig> -fold more vhsv was present in fins than in organs.
however, if the decreases in transcription are due to the virus, one would expect to see the most significant decreases in fins where the vhsv is more abundant.
as an alternative explanation, transcriptions in organs could be inhibited by some soluble viral protein released from the infected fish surfaces.
there are not yet any evidences to decide for an explanation of these data.
the differential increased expression obtained in fins indicate that zebrafish responses are not fully immunocompromised at low temperatures.
low external and therefore low body temperatures in zebrafish can be immunosuppressive, as it has been supported by numerous studies.
however, most of those studies demonstrate a delay or inhibition of adaptative immune responses, while at least some innate defenses were increased until the specific immune system adapted  <cit> .
thus, cold acclimatized zebrafish fins increased the expression of proteins and transcripts of some immune-related genes after vhsv infection , confirming some previous results on rhabdoviral vaccinated zebrafish  <cit> .
however, under the conditions used, most of the organ early responses previously described in infection-by-injection models could not be detected in fins   <cit> , although some of them  were detected in organs .
on the other hand, because vhsv  <cit>  or spring viremia carp virus svcv  <cit>  maximal mortalities only occurred at lower than physiological temperatures, there is no other way to study gene responses to rhabdoviral infections.
high mortalities at low temperatures could be explained by a more rapid vhsv replication rate in comparison with slower zebrafish defenses, such as it was suggested in the zebrafish/svcv model  <cit> .
comparison of the gene expressions between zebrafish/vhsv and zebrafish/svcv models might help to identify new genes, since while mortalities are maximal at similar temperatures   <cit> , optimal svcv in vitro replication occurs at 20-22°c which is closer to the zebrafish optimal temperature.
because zebrafish without cold acclimatation was refractory to infection-by-immersion with ihnv  <cit> , vhsv  <cit>  or even with svcv  <cit> , there must exist some temperature-dependent host response mechanism that inhibits rhabdoviral infection and/or their spreading.
this temperature-dependence might be of interest for further studies.
increased il <dig> transcripts with >2-fold but p >  <dig> , were found in the fins by both arrays while they were inhibited in organs .
il <dig> is produced in mammalian macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells and b lymphocytes in response to intracellular pathogens.
il <dig> stimulates tnfa, but no induction of tnfa was observed in fins despite of the presence of induced expression levels of il <dig>  nevertheless, tnfa was the most increased transcript in organs according to the oligo microarray data  but with p >  <dig> .
il <dig> has been abundantly described as a viral vaccine adjuvant to increase protective mucosal immunity  <cit> .
it has not been tested in fish.
other transcripts only appeared differentially expressed in one of the arrays, such as il <dig> d and il <dig> .
both il <dig> and il <dig> are produced by t helper  <dig>  cells  <cit>  to synergistically induce antimicrobial peptides  <cit>  in human keratinocytes  <cit> .
at this respect,  <dig> antimicrobial peptides increased in vhsv-infected zebrafish fins and organs, including the hepcidin antimicrobial peptide  <dig>  and the β defensin  genes, the former one with p >  <dig> .
increased hamp <dig> had also been detected in turbot by microarray analysis of bacterial  <cit>  and nodavirus  <cit>  infections and in stimulated rts <dig> trout macrophage cell line  <cit> .
since, previous findings also implicated defbl <dig> in both rhabdoviral blocking and activation of trout immune defense genes  <cit> , these  <dig> antimicrobial peptides might deserve further studies.
CONCLUSIONS
vhsv, ihnv and svcv natural infections with maximal mortalities occur in salmonids and/or carp after low or changing temperatures in the spring and/or autumn.
the results described here demonstrate that, at least zebrafish are not fully immunocompromised at low temperatures.
increased fin transcript levels detected by both q-pcr and hybridization arrays corresponded to previously described infection-related genes such as complement components  or class i histocompatibility antigens  and to newly described genes such as secreted immunoglobulin domain , macrophage stimulating factor  and a cluster differentiation antigen .
the genes described would contribute to the knowledge of the earliest molecular events occurring in the fish surface tissues at the beginning of natural rhabdoviral infections and/or might be new candidates to be tested as molecular adjuvants for fish vaccines.

for each experiment,  <dig> zebrafish were infected with  <dig> ×  <dig> ffu of vhsv/ml at 14°c while other  <dig> zebrafish remained non-infected. rna was extracted from the fins or organs 2-days after vhsv or mock infection, converted to cdna and used for the amplitaq reaction in  <dig> well plates containing  <dig> ×  <dig> selected immune-related zebrafish taqman assays . in each plate,  <dig> ×  <dig> assays of the rplp <dig> gene were used for normalization. the mean and their corresponding p  were then calculated from  <dig> experiments. the transcripts from either fins and/or organs with >2-fold and p <  <dig>  changes were first tabulated and then the rest of the table was completed with their corresponding calculated fold values in organs and/or fins, respectively. fold, expression level in vhsv-infected tissue/expression level in non-infected tissue. +, increased. -, decreased. ~, similar. figure  <dig> shows the representation of means and standard errors  of all the genes.

complement component fin transcripts corresponding to c3b, c8g and c <dig> increased after vhsv infection , while the same transcripts did not increased in organs, except c <dig> .

major histocompatibility complex class i  transcripts, one of the induced host molecules identified in most infections-by-injection, increased more than 3-fold in the fins, however, it was not increased in organs . other differentially increased transcripts in fins which were not increased in organs were those corresponding to the secreted immunoglobulin domain  <dig>  of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and macrophage stimulating factor . among all the cluster differentiation  antigen transcripts present in the immune-related probes , only cd <dig> and cd  <dig> were differentially increased in fins but not in organs .

among the transcripts corresponding to the interleukin  genes studied , only il <dig> d and its related il <dig>  were differentially increased in fins. some of the other il <dig> family members such as il17a/f <dig> and il <dig> d were also increased in fins, however, with p >  <dig>  . there were not similar increases in organs for any of the studied il transcripts .

interferon  transcripts, which increased > 2-fold in zebrafish organs after vhsv infection-by-injection in a previous report  <cit> , did not changed at the fins/organs after infection-by-immersion . however, the primers designed to estimate ifn <dig> by the q-pcr gene expression assay , only amplified the virus-independent ifn <dig> isoform which remains unaltered upon viral infection  <cit> .

defensin β  increased in organs and fins  but it was eliminated from table  <dig>  because both of their transcript levels showed p >  <dig> .

no immune-related gene transcripts decreased >  <dig> fold in fins , while of the  <dig> transcripts that decreased > 2-fold in organs, only crfb <dig> have p <  <dig>  .

immune-related transcript changes in fins/organs after vhsv infection by hybridization to oligo microarrays
the signal intensities obtained after hybridization of samples from zebrafish fins and organs to microarrays, ranged from  <dig> to ~ <dig>  fluorescence units. differential expression changes were then calculated by comparing vhsv-infected versus non-infected samples. of the  <dig> oligo sequences present in the zebrafish microarray latest version,  <dig>  or  <dig>  in fins or organs, respectively, showed > 3-fold increases . on the other hand,  <dig> % or  <dig> % in fins or organs, respectively showed a significant departure from the null hypothesis when t-tests were performed at the p <  <dig>  significance level. of the  <dig> immune-related sequences annotated in the zebrafish microarray,  <dig>  in fins and  <dig>  in organs increased > 2-fold with p <  <dig>  after vhsv infection. in contrast,  <dig>  sequences in fins and  <dig>  in organs decreased > 2-fold after vhsv infection .

for each experiment,  <dig> zebrafish were infected with  <dig> ×  <dig> ffu of vhsv/ml at 14°c while other  <dig> zebrafish remained non-infected. rna was extracted from the fins or organs 2-days after vhsv or mock infection, labeled with cy <dig> and hybridized to the microarrays. the  <dig> immune-related selected sequences from the 4x <dig> k microarray  from zebrafish were selected and their data analyzed. in each microarray,  <dig> assays of rplp <dig> gene were used for normalization. the mean and p  were then calculated from  <dig> experiments. the transcripts from either fins and/or organs with >2-fold and p <  <dig>  changes were first tabulated and then the rest of the table was completed with their corresponding calculated fold values in organs and/or fins, respectively. fold, expression level in vhsv-infected tissue/expression level in non-infected tissue. +, increased. -, decreased. ~, similar. figure  <dig> shows the representation of the means of all the immune-related genes.

the genes corresponding to the proteins identified in the proteomic analysis were searched in the microarray data and a column with that data added to table  <dig>  because they were present in several copies per microarray, the averages of their differential transcriptional levels were calculated and represented. although some of the increased  and decreased  proteins showed a similar change in their differential transcript levels, the rest of protein changes did not correlate with those of their corresponding transcripts.

many complement transcripts  including those increased in the q-pcr arrays , increased in fins . only the c <dig> transcripts increased in both fins and organs , as confirmed by  <dig> different oligo sequences of the same gene present in the microarray. sequences for the rest of complement related genes  were neither present in the microarray  nor in the q-pcr array . increased c1q transcripts  were only found increased in organs but with p >  <dig>  .

of the  <dig> major histocompatibility complex  sequences present in the annotated immune-related microarray sequences, only those corresponding to the mhc1uaa and mhc1ze genes in fins  were increased. however, most of their lower folds and p >  <dig>  values resulted from their higher folds in only one of the experiments .

previously described up-regulated typical gene markers of viral infection-by-injection, il1b  or tnfa  were found among the genes increased in fins or organs  but with p >  <dig> .

two different oligo sequences from the hepcidin antimicrobial peptide  <dig>  gene detected similarly increased transcripts in the fins but not in organs .

some of the  <dig> transcripts corresponding to immunoglobulin-related genes , specially those corresponding to the heavy chain gene, increased in the fins   and in the organs . among the transcripts increased, those corresponding to the newly described immunoglobulin z, both at the fins  and at the organs  might be relevant to mucosal immunity as could be expected from a natural route of infection.

discussion
major protein changes at the fins after vhsv infection
the differential expression  of fin proteins, identified their most abundant proteins with high variations among experiments . individual fish variation in the development of vhsv infection and on the different amounts of muscle sampled at the bases of the fins , different yields of the fin protein precipitation techniques and 2d-dige technical irreproducibility, all contributed to the wide quantitative differences. nevertheless, some differential abundances of the major protein components could be detected.

for instance, most of the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway were differentially increased . similar enzymes were also found among the cdna library genes from hrv-infected leukocytes of japanese flounder  <cit> . in contrast, no enzyme transcripts related to the glycolytic pathway increased in organs after hrv  <cit>  or ihnv  <cit>  infection-by-injection, nor in dna vaccination-by-injection with the g gene of hrv  <cit> , vhsv  <cit>  or ihnv  <cit> .

many proteins classified and/or related to the cytoskeleton , vesicle trafficking and/or fin regeneration   <cit>  were differentially expressed . at least some of those might reflect fin regeneration attempts to compensate for their destruction as vhsv infection progresses. similar proteins were also found among the cdna obtained from the hrv-infected leukocytes of the japanese flounder mentioned above  <cit> .

increases of hmgb <dig> protein levels  were detected in vhsv-infected fins. however, their transcript levels were unchanged . similarly, hmgb <dig> transcript profiles after intramuscular injection of the ihnv g gene in trout showed that none of their  <dig> cdnas microarray probes changed  <cit> . nevertheless, transcripts of hmgb <dig> were identified among the hrv-infected leukocytes of japanese flounder  <cit>  and a  <dig> -fold increase of hmgb2-like  <dig> kidney transcripts was found in ihnv-infected trout  . in mammalians, hmgb <dig> is an abundant nuclear protein being secreted upon bacterial infections to enhance tissue repair, attract inflammatory cells, induce chemokines, and activate dendritic cells. all these properties make hmgb <dig> an important intermediate between innate and adaptative responses  <cit>  and a vaccine adjuvant candidate  <cit> . most recently, secreted hmgb <dig> from dendritic cells was demonstrated during dengue viral replication  <cit>  and it has also been tested as a vaccine adjuvant  <cit> . the potential use of hmgb <dig> as an adjuvant for fish vaccines, therefore, might deserve further attention.

the differential expression of some fin proteins  showed a parallel variation in their transcript levels . however, in most of them, the protein differential expression changes did not correlate with their corresponding transcript changes, suggesting that regulation of their expression was not at the transcriptional level, at least in 2-day vhsv-infected fins. although correlation of gene and protein expression levels have been found in some plants  <cit> , most studies found no correlation, including a recent report on individual e. coli cells  <cit> . on the other hand, exclusive post-translational regulation of enzymes of the glycolytic pathway has been reported  <cit> , which could explain some of the data found here. although, similar studies are still scarce, correlation values comparing gene/protein expression levels in several systems were very low  <cit> , and varied with the protein relative abundance and their half-life time. most correlation values showed that mrna might be a poor indicator of protein expression. study of mrna levels, is justified when there is no other way to study gene expression levels, as in the present case where the vhsv immune-related proteins cannot be detected by the proteomic approach.

transcript level changes of immune-related genes at the fins and organs after vhsv infection
the number of the  <dig> immune-related transcripts differentially increased were higher in fins than in organs as estimated by q-pcr. similar results were obtained with the  <dig> immune-related transcripts estimated by microarray hybridization. in contrast, the number of differentially decreased transcripts were higher in organs than in fins . it seems likely that 2-days after infection-by-immersion, vhsv has not yet caused an increased differential response from the internal organs, contrary to what has been described for infection-by-injection in other fish models  <cit> . the lower numbers of increased transcripts seen in organs compared to fins may be due to a delay in virus tissue infiltration. thus, the reason for the major differences seen in transcription may be solely because  <dig> -fold more vhsv was present in fins than in organs. however, if the decreases in transcription are due to the virus, one would expect to see the most significant decreases in fins where the vhsv is more abundant. as an alternative explanation, transcriptions in organs could be inhibited by some soluble viral protein released from the infected fish surfaces. there are not yet any evidences to decide for an explanation of these data.

the differential increased expression obtained in fins indicate that zebrafish responses are not fully immunocompromised at low temperatures. low external and therefore low body temperatures in zebrafish can be immunosuppressive, as it has been supported by numerous studies. however, most of those studies demonstrate a delay or inhibition of adaptative immune responses, while at least some innate defenses were increased until the specific immune system adapted  <cit> . thus, cold acclimatized zebrafish fins increased the expression of proteins and transcripts of some immune-related genes after vhsv infection , confirming some previous results on rhabdoviral vaccinated zebrafish  <cit> . however, under the conditions used, most of the organ early responses previously described in infection-by-injection models could not be detected in fins   <cit> , although some of them  were detected in organs . on the other hand, because vhsv  <cit>  or spring viremia carp virus svcv  <cit>  maximal mortalities only occurred at lower than physiological temperatures, there is no other way to study gene responses to rhabdoviral infections. high mortalities at low temperatures could be explained by a more rapid vhsv replication rate in comparison with slower zebrafish defenses, such as it was suggested in the zebrafish/svcv model  <cit> . comparison of the gene expressions between zebrafish/vhsv and zebrafish/svcv models might help to identify new genes, since while mortalities are maximal at similar temperatures   <cit> , optimal svcv in vitro replication occurs at 20-22°c which is closer to the zebrafish optimal temperature. because zebrafish without cold acclimatation was refractory to infection-by-immersion with ihnv  <cit> , vhsv  <cit>  or even with svcv  <cit> , there must exist some temperature-dependent host response mechanism that inhibits rhabdoviral infection and/or their spreading. this temperature-dependence might be of interest for further studies.

increased il <dig> transcripts with >2-fold but p >  <dig> , were found in the fins by both arrays while they were inhibited in organs . il <dig> is produced in mammalian macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells and b lymphocytes in response to intracellular pathogens. il <dig> stimulates tnfa, but no induction of tnfa was observed in fins despite of the presence of induced expression levels of il <dig>  nevertheless, tnfa was the most increased transcript in organs according to the oligo microarray data  but with p >  <dig> . il <dig> has been abundantly described as a viral vaccine adjuvant to increase protective mucosal immunity  <cit> . it has not been tested in fish.

other transcripts only appeared differentially expressed in one of the arrays, such as il <dig> d and il <dig> . both il <dig> and il <dig> are produced by t helper  <dig>  cells  <cit>  to synergistically induce antimicrobial peptides  <cit>  in human keratinocytes  <cit> . at this respect,  <dig> antimicrobial peptides increased in vhsv-infected zebrafish fins and organs, including the hepcidin antimicrobial peptide  <dig>  and the β defensin  genes, the former one with p >  <dig> . increased hamp <dig> had also been detected in turbot by microarray analysis of bacterial  <cit>  and nodavirus  <cit>  infections and in stimulated rts <dig> trout macrophage cell line  <cit> . since, previous findings also implicated defbl <dig> in both rhabdoviral blocking and activation of trout immune defense genes  <cit> , these  <dig> antimicrobial peptides might deserve further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
vhsv, ihnv and svcv natural infections with maximal mortalities occur in salmonids and/or carp after low or changing temperatures in the spring and/or autumn. the results described here demonstrate that, at least zebrafish are not fully immunocompromised at low temperatures. increased fin transcript levels detected by both q-pcr and hybridization arrays corresponded to previously described infection-related genes such as complement components  or class i histocompatibility antigens  and to newly described genes such as secreted immunoglobulin domain , macrophage stimulating factor  and a cluster differentiation antigen . the genes described would contribute to the knowledge of the earliest molecular events occurring in the fish surface tissues at the beginning of natural rhabdoviral infections and/or might be new candidates to be tested as molecular adjuvants for fish vaccines.

"BACKGROUND
activin a, a pleiotrophic cytokine belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta  superfamily, is synthesized by many cell types throughout the body  <cit> .
the molecular structure is a disulphide-linked, homodimeric glycoprotein composed of two inhibin βa chains.
activin a was first recognized as an endocrine factor, but is now known to be essential to developmental and repair processes, and total ablation is neonatal lethal  <cit> .
contrasting regulatory roles have been cited for activin a in inflammation  <cit> .
human monocytes synthesize activin a upon stimulation with classical m <dig> macrophage activation inducers such as gm-csf, lps, and ifnγ  <cit> .
exposure of gm-csf treated macrophages to anti-activin a reduces m <dig> markers and enhances alternative m <dig> phenotype markers such as il- <dig>  <cit> .
activin a also inhibits monocyte production of il-1β and enhances il- <dig> receptor antagonist production  <cit> .
interestingly, in severe asthma, activin a may be elevated in serum, and data from animal models suggests that activin a may suppress t helper  <dig>  mediated allergic responses  <cit> .
collectively these observations suggest multifunctional roles for activin a in inflammatory processes.
maintenance of lung homeostasis is a complex process dependent upon a network of interacting cells and cytokines.
gm-csf is required for alveolar macrophage  function and pulmonary homeostasis  <cit> .
in genetically altered mice homozygous for a disrupted gm-csf gene , hematopoiesis is normal but there is accumulation of excess lung surfactant  <cit> .
this surfactant pathology mirrors that of human pap, an autoimmune disease characterized by high levels of autoantibody to gm-csf  <cit> .
aerosolized gm-csf resolves the pulmonary pathology of gm-csf knockout mice, thus demonstrating that surfactant homeostasis can be influenced by local administration of gm-csf to the respiratory tract  <cit> .
previously we reported that healthy human ams synthesize activin a in response to gm-csf but ams of patients with pap are deficient in activin a  <cit> .
in addition, pap ams are deficient in the nuclear transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, , a regulator of lipid and glucose metabolism that is restored by gm-csf treatment  <cit> .
pparγ has also been shown to be a negative regulator of inflammation  <cit> .
interestingly, alveolar macrophages of gm-csf knockout mice are also deficient in pparγ  <cit> .
the role of activin a in the lung has not been established.
because of the phenotypic similarities between human pap and the gm-csf knockout mouse, this study was undertaken to investigate activin a regulation in the lung.
initially, it was hypothesized that activin a might be impaired in gm-csf knockout mice based upon previous data from pap studies  <cit> .
RESULTS
activin a and ifnγ are intrinsically elevated in gm-csf knockout mice as compared to wild-type mice
unlike previous findings of activin a deficiency in human pap  <cit> , activin a mrna expression of bal cells was significantly  elevated in gm-csf knockout mice compared to wild-type controls .
quantification of activin a protein in bal fluids confirmed mrna findings with significantly  elevated protein levels in gm-csf knockout compared to wild-type .
gm-csf knockout expression of follistatin, an inhibitor of activin a  <cit> , was similar to wild-type mice  and thus could not account for the striking elevation of activin a.
intrinsic factors that could potentially affect activin a levels were subsequently investigated in gm-csf knockout mice.
macrophage colony-stimulating factor  has been reported to be upregulated in gm-csf knockout mice  <cit> .
examination of m-csf in the current study, however, indicated no effect on activin a in vitro in either wild-type or gm-csf knockout ams .
elevated ifnγ has been reported in lungs of gm-csf knockout mice  <cit>  therefore intrinsic levels of ifnγ were examined.
ifnγ mrna expression was significantly  elevated in gm-csf knockout bal cells compared to wild-type controls .
immunocytochemistry of gm-csf knockout bal cells confirmed mrna results and indicated markedly increased expression of intracellular ifnγ protein compared to wild-type .
ifnγ is not elevated in human pap bal cells
in contrast to results from gm-csf knockout mice, examination of ifnγ expression in human bal cells from pap patients revealed no significant increase compared to healthy controls .
activin a levels are enhanced by ifnγ and reduced by ifnγ blockade
ifnγ has been shown to upregulate activin a expression in human monocytes  <cit>  but ams have not been studied.
results from 24-hour in vitro cultures of wild-type ams indicated that ifnγ  significantly  increased activin a expression .
to determine whether blockade of ifnγ with specific anti-ifnγ antibody would alter intrinsic activin a expression, unstimulated gm-csf knockout ams were cultured in vitro for 24 hours with irrelevant immunoglobulin  or anti-ifnγ.
elisa analysis of conditioned media indicated that anti-ifnγ reduced activin a protein synthesis compared to irrelevant ig  confirming that ifnγ blockade reduced intrinsic activin a production.
because activin a is intrinsically elevated in pparγ deficient gm-csf knockout mice but severely decreased in pparγ deficient human pap patients  <cit> , it appeared unlikely that pparγ would exert a direct effect on activin a. observations made elsewhere  <cit>  also found no evidence of a pparγ effect on activin a. we have shown, however, that ifnγ is elevated in macrophage-specific pparγ knockout mice and significantly reduced after in vivo restoration of pparγ via a lentivirus vector  <cit> .
we utilized this approach to determine whether pparγ restoration in gm-csf knockout mice might reduce ifnγ and thereby reduce activin a. results supported this action.
ten days post intratracheal inoculation of lentivirus reagents into gm-csf knockout mice, bal cell mrna expression of both ifnγ and activin a was significantly reduced in animals receiving lentivirus-pparγ compared to controls receiving lentivirus-egfp  .
human alveolar macrophage activin a is increased by ifnγ
while the above studies clearly defined ifnγ-mediated regulation of activin a in murine alveolar macrophages, it was necessary to confirm this pathway in human alveolar macrophages.
in vitro studies demonstrated that ifnγ significantly enhanced activin a protein production  in healthy human alveolar macrophages.
thus activin a synthesis in both human and murine alveolar macrophages is responsive to ifnγ upregulation even though intrinsic activin a levels differ between human and mouse.
gm-csf bal cells show intrinsic elevation of both m <dig> and m <dig> macrophage phenotypic markers
we and others reported previously that m-csf gene expression and protein, a cytokine associated with the m <dig> macrophage phenotype, was elevated in gm-csf knockout mice  <cit> .
current data indicate that the m1-associated cytokine, ifnγ  is also increased in these mice.
therefore, it was unclear whether gm-csf knockout bal cells would express predominantly m <dig> or m <dig> profiles.
to address this issue, we determined mrna expression of several m <dig> and m <dig> markers in gm-csf knockout bal cells.
with respect to m <dig> markers, we examined the ifnγ-regulated target gene, inos , together with ccl <dig> , and il- <dig> , and found that all were significantly elevated compared to wild-type mice.
the m <dig> marker, il- <dig>  has been reported to be suppressed by elevated activin a  <cit> , and in pap, activin a deficiency is accompanied by elevated il- <dig>  <cit> .
surprisingly, analysis of il- <dig> expression in gm-csf knockout bal cells revealed significantly elevated levels compared to wild-type mice .
analysis of another m2-associated marker, ccl <dig>  also indicated significant elevation compared to wild-type mice .
these results suggested that gm-csf knockout alveolar macrophages might constitute a mixed population of both m <dig> and m <dig> phenotypes.
discussion
the current findings suggest that ifnγ is a major contributory factor to the intrinsic elevation of activin a in ams.
findings also point out a striking difference in activin a expression in human pap and gm-csf knockout mice despite common deficiencies of gm-csf and pparγ .
in parallel with activin a, gm-csf knockout mice displayed over-expression of ifnγ  <cit> , a positive regulator of activin a  <cit> .
in contrast, bal cells of pap patients do not exhibit elevated ifnγ and activin a is deficient  <cit> .
elevated ifnγ has been reported previously in the bal fluids of gm-csf knockout mice  <cit> .
our previous studies also found elevated ifnγ expression in macrophage-specific pparγ knockout mice  <cit> .
restoration of pparγ via lentivirus vector in these mice greatly diminished ifnγ expression  <cit> .
in the current study, similar results were seen after pparγ–lentivirus treatment of gm-csf knockout mice.
such findings suggest that the pparγ deficiency present in gm-csf knockout mice may contribute to elevated ifnγ.
gm-csf has been shown to be a critical upregulator of pparγ  <cit> .
the total lack of gm-csf in knockout mice may maintain an extreme pparγ deficiency which is ineffective at repressing inflammatory mediators such as ifnγ.
in human pap, ifnγ levels are not increased despite pparγ deficiency, furthermore, gm-csf is not totally absent  <cit> .
the primary etiology of pap is considered to be an autoimmune response to gm-csf in the form of high levels of circulating, neutralizing autoantibody to gm-csf  <cit> .
it is also possible that additional regulatory mechanisms are present in human lung to help prevent ifnγ buildup in pap.
the varying characteristics of activated macrophages have led to attempts to categorize activation phenotypes  <cit> .
the m <dig> phenotype is characterized by production of microbial or ifnγ-triggered molecules such as inos and il- <dig>  gm-csf has been cited as an inducer of m <dig> phenotypes while m-csf has been shown to induce the m <dig> alternative activation phenotype in which il- <dig> or tgfβ may be produced  <cit> .
we have shown that m-csf is elevated in gm-csf knockout mice  <cit>  and in human pap  <cit>  which might suggest the presence of an m <dig> macrophage phenotype .
interestingly, pparγ, which is deficient in gm-csf knockout mice, is also a major driver of the m <dig> phenotype  <cit> .
it has been pointed out however, that macrophage phenotypes were defined by carefully controlled in vitro conditions which may be vastly different from the in vivo milieu  <cit> .
thus the juxtaposition of both ifnγ and m-csf in the lungs of gm-csf knockout mice could produce the novel combination of macrophage activation phenotypes illustrated by elevated m <dig>  and m <dig>  markers .
other ifnγ-inducible pro-inflammatory mediators  have been noted in the lungs of gm-csf knockout mice  <cit> .
previously, we found that mmp- <dig>  a matrix metalloproteinase associated with m-csf and alternative m <dig> activation, is also elevated in gm-csf knockout bal cells  <cit> .
CONCLUSIONS
the current findings extend our previous studies examining pulmonary mechanisms operative in human pap and the gm-csf knockout mouse.
it is clear that pathways of activin a regulation may utilize gm-csf or ifnγ as stimulatory factors.
in the gm-csf knockout mouse, lack of gm-csf may restrict production of sufficient pparγ to control inflammation.
the persistent elevation of both m-csf and ifnγ may influence ams to express characteristics of both m <dig> and m <dig> phenotypes.
the current data emphasize the plasticity of alveolar macrophages in assuming a unique activation phenotype when regulatory pathways become dysfunctional.

activin a and ifnγ are intrinsically elevated in gm-csf knockout mice as compared to wild-type mice
unlike previous findings of activin a deficiency in human pap  <cit> , activin a mrna expression of bal cells was significantly  elevated in gm-csf knockout mice compared to wild-type controls . quantification of activin a protein in bal fluids confirmed mrna findings with significantly  elevated protein levels in gm-csf knockout compared to wild-type . gm-csf knockout expression of follistatin, an inhibitor of activin a  <cit> , was similar to wild-type mice  and thus could not account for the striking elevation of activin a.

intrinsic factors that could potentially affect activin a levels were subsequently investigated in gm-csf knockout mice. macrophage colony-stimulating factor  has been reported to be upregulated in gm-csf knockout mice  <cit> . examination of m-csf in the current study, however, indicated no effect on activin a in vitro in either wild-type or gm-csf knockout ams . elevated ifnγ has been reported in lungs of gm-csf knockout mice  <cit>  therefore intrinsic levels of ifnγ were examined. ifnγ mrna expression was significantly  elevated in gm-csf knockout bal cells compared to wild-type controls . immunocytochemistry of gm-csf knockout bal cells confirmed mrna results and indicated markedly increased expression of intracellular ifnγ protein compared to wild-type .

ifnγ is not elevated in human pap bal cells
in contrast to results from gm-csf knockout mice, examination of ifnγ expression in human bal cells from pap patients revealed no significant increase compared to healthy controls .

activin a levels are enhanced by ifnγ and reduced by ifnγ blockade
ifnγ has been shown to upregulate activin a expression in human monocytes  <cit>  but ams have not been studied. results from 24-hour in vitro cultures of wild-type ams indicated that ifnγ  significantly  increased activin a expression . to determine whether blockade of ifnγ with specific anti-ifnγ antibody would alter intrinsic activin a expression, unstimulated gm-csf knockout ams were cultured in vitro for 24 hours with irrelevant immunoglobulin  or anti-ifnγ. elisa analysis of conditioned media indicated that anti-ifnγ reduced activin a protein synthesis compared to irrelevant ig  confirming that ifnγ blockade reduced intrinsic activin a production.

because activin a is intrinsically elevated in pparγ deficient gm-csf knockout mice but severely decreased in pparγ deficient human pap patients  <cit> , it appeared unlikely that pparγ would exert a direct effect on activin a. observations made elsewhere  <cit>  also found no evidence of a pparγ effect on activin a. we have shown, however, that ifnγ is elevated in macrophage-specific pparγ knockout mice and significantly reduced after in vivo restoration of pparγ via a lentivirus vector  <cit> . we utilized this approach to determine whether pparγ restoration in gm-csf knockout mice might reduce ifnγ and thereby reduce activin a. results supported this action. ten days post intratracheal inoculation of lentivirus reagents into gm-csf knockout mice, bal cell mrna expression of both ifnγ and activin a was significantly reduced in animals receiving lentivirus-pparγ compared to controls receiving lentivirus-egfp  .

human alveolar macrophage activin a is increased by ifnγ
while the above studies clearly defined ifnγ-mediated regulation of activin a in murine alveolar macrophages, it was necessary to confirm this pathway in human alveolar macrophages. in vitro studies demonstrated that ifnγ significantly enhanced activin a protein production  in healthy human alveolar macrophages. thus activin a synthesis in both human and murine alveolar macrophages is responsive to ifnγ upregulation even though intrinsic activin a levels differ between human and mouse.

gm-csf bal cells show intrinsic elevation of both m <dig> and m <dig> macrophage phenotypic markers
we and others reported previously that m-csf gene expression and protein, a cytokine associated with the m <dig> macrophage phenotype, was elevated in gm-csf knockout mice  <cit> . current data indicate that the m1-associated cytokine, ifnγ  is also increased in these mice. therefore, it was unclear whether gm-csf knockout bal cells would express predominantly m <dig> or m <dig> profiles. to address this issue, we determined mrna expression of several m <dig> and m <dig> markers in gm-csf knockout bal cells. with respect to m <dig> markers, we examined the ifnγ-regulated target gene, inos , together with ccl <dig> , and il- <dig> , and found that all were significantly elevated compared to wild-type mice. the m <dig> marker, il- <dig>  has been reported to be suppressed by elevated activin a  <cit> , and in pap, activin a deficiency is accompanied by elevated il- <dig>  <cit> . surprisingly, analysis of il- <dig> expression in gm-csf knockout bal cells revealed significantly elevated levels compared to wild-type mice . analysis of another m2-associated marker, ccl <dig>  also indicated significant elevation compared to wild-type mice . these results suggested that gm-csf knockout alveolar macrophages might constitute a mixed population of both m <dig> and m <dig> phenotypes.

discussion
the current findings suggest that ifnγ is a major contributory factor to the intrinsic elevation of activin a in ams. findings also point out a striking difference in activin a expression in human pap and gm-csf knockout mice despite common deficiencies of gm-csf and pparγ . in parallel with activin a, gm-csf knockout mice displayed over-expression of ifnγ  <cit> , a positive regulator of activin a  <cit> . in contrast, bal cells of pap patients do not exhibit elevated ifnγ and activin a is deficient  <cit> .

elevated ifnγ has been reported previously in the bal fluids of gm-csf knockout mice  <cit> . our previous studies also found elevated ifnγ expression in macrophage-specific pparγ knockout mice  <cit> . restoration of pparγ via lentivirus vector in these mice greatly diminished ifnγ expression  <cit> . in the current study, similar results were seen after pparγ–lentivirus treatment of gm-csf knockout mice. such findings suggest that the pparγ deficiency present in gm-csf knockout mice may contribute to elevated ifnγ. gm-csf has been shown to be a critical upregulator of pparγ  <cit> . the total lack of gm-csf in knockout mice may maintain an extreme pparγ deficiency which is ineffective at repressing inflammatory mediators such as ifnγ. in human pap, ifnγ levels are not increased despite pparγ deficiency, furthermore, gm-csf is not totally absent  <cit> . the primary etiology of pap is considered to be an autoimmune response to gm-csf in the form of high levels of circulating, neutralizing autoantibody to gm-csf  <cit> . it is also possible that additional regulatory mechanisms are present in human lung to help prevent ifnγ buildup in pap.

the varying characteristics of activated macrophages have led to attempts to categorize activation phenotypes  <cit> . the m <dig> phenotype is characterized by production of microbial or ifnγ-triggered molecules such as inos and il- <dig>  gm-csf has been cited as an inducer of m <dig> phenotypes while m-csf has been shown to induce the m <dig> alternative activation phenotype in which il- <dig> or tgfβ may be produced  <cit> . we have shown that m-csf is elevated in gm-csf knockout mice  <cit>  and in human pap  <cit>  which might suggest the presence of an m <dig> macrophage phenotype . interestingly, pparγ, which is deficient in gm-csf knockout mice, is also a major driver of the m <dig> phenotype  <cit> . it has been pointed out however, that macrophage phenotypes were defined by carefully controlled in vitro conditions which may be vastly different from the in vivo milieu  <cit> . thus the juxtaposition of both ifnγ and m-csf in the lungs of gm-csf knockout mice could produce the novel combination of macrophage activation phenotypes illustrated by elevated m <dig>  and m <dig>  markers . other ifnγ-inducible pro-inflammatory mediators  have been noted in the lungs of gm-csf knockout mice  <cit> . previously, we found that mmp- <dig>  a matrix metalloproteinase associated with m-csf and alternative m <dig> activation, is also elevated in gm-csf knockout bal cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the current findings extend our previous studies examining pulmonary mechanisms operative in human pap and the gm-csf knockout mouse. it is clear that pathways of activin a regulation may utilize gm-csf or ifnγ as stimulatory factors. in the gm-csf knockout mouse, lack of gm-csf may restrict production of sufficient pparγ to control inflammation. the persistent elevation of both m-csf and ifnγ may influence ams to express characteristics of both m <dig> and m <dig> phenotypes. the current data emphasize the plasticity of alveolar macrophages in assuming a unique activation phenotype when regulatory pathways become dysfunctional.

both ifnγ and activin a were also reduced in gm-csf knockout mice in vivo after intratracheal instillation of lentivirus-pparγ compared to control lentivirus vector.

in vitro studies confirmed that ifnγ stimulated activin a in wild-type ams while antibody to ifnγ reduced activin a in gm-csf knockout ams.

"BACKGROUND
proliferating cellular nuclear antigen , an evolutionarily conserved protein found in eukaryotes and archaebacteria serves as a docking platform for many proteins that function in dna replication, repair, recombination, cell cycle, and chromatin remodeling  <cit> .
it belongs to a family of sliding clamps that increase processivity of replicative dna polymerases  <cit> .
despite little sequence similarity among the sliding clamps in all domains of life, they possess superimposable three-dimensional structures with highly conserved functions  <cit> .
a typical sliding clamp comprises of multimeric, toroidal-shaped structures with pseudo-six fold symmetry that encircles the dna double helix  <cit> .
while β-clamp, the sliding clamp of eubacteria is a homodimer; pcna of eukaryotes and t <dig> bacteriophage is a homotrimer, and a heterotrimer in archaea  <cit> .
each pcna monomer consists of two globular topologically identical domains connected by an inter domain connecting loop .
the three dimensional structure reveals that the inner surface of the pcna ring is comprised of  <dig> α-helices with suitably exposed positively charged amino acids to interact with the sugar-phosphate backbone of dna, whereas the outer surface is composed of  <dig> β-sheets and three idcls appropriate for protein–protein interactions  <cit> .
pcna by itself cannot directly encircle dna; rather it is loaded by a eukaryotic clamp loader, rfc  <cit> .
the loaded pcna ring only recruits polymerases and other factors firmly to dna, making the sliding clamp an essential cofactor for dna transaction processes.
apart from dna polymerases, pcna is found to interact with proteins such as fen <dig>  dna glycosylases, dna ligase i, p <dig>  cck <dig>  cyclin d, dna methyltransferases etc.
.
pcna interacts with its partners mostly through its idcl but occasionally by its c-terminus, the center loop and the backside loop  <cit>  .
mutational analysis of yeast pcna has suggested separate roles for pcna in dna replication and repairs  <cit> .
for example; pcna mutants like pol30- <dig>  and pol30- <dig>  show sensitivity to dna methylating agents and uv light, however they grow normally on medium containing a replication inhibitor hydroxyurea, and do not elicit any temperature sensitivity.
similarly pcna- <dig>  and pcna- <dig>  alleles generate frame-shift and substitution mutations due to reduced mmr efficiency but do not show any defects in replication or other repair processes.
in vitro binding studies revealed a compromised interaction of these mutant proteins with msh <dig> and msh <dig> proteins.
a number of pcna mutants have also been characterized those are defective in both dna replication and repair processes.
alleles like pcna- <dig> that has il <dig>  128aa mutations in the idcl, and pcna- <dig> that carries pk <dig>  253aa mutations in the carboxyl terminal tail exhibit growth defects, elevated sensitivity to dna-damaging agents, and higher rates of spontaneous mutations  <cit> .
biochemical characterization of some of these mutant pcnas e.g.
pcna- <dig> often showed structural alteration and reduced stability of the trimeric ring  <cit> .
pcna has been characterized in human, rat, budding and fission yeasts, protozoan, flies, arabidopsis, and many archaeal species .
however, no such studies of pcna from pathogenic candida albicans or any other candida species have been carried out till date.
c. albicans, an opportunistic pathogen, which asymptomatically colonizes humans, can cause severe infection in immounocompromised people or when the microbiotic balance is disturbed  <cit> .
systemic fungal infections by c. albicans are life threatening and of great concern to human health  <cit> .
study of the fundamental cellular processes such as dna replication, repair and recombination in this pathogenic yeast and their parallel comparison with nonpathogenic s. cerevisiae is crucial to unravel the distinct biochemical processes or factors, which may be targeted to control infections/diseases.
dna repair mechanisms like base excision repair  and nucleotide excision repair  are well studied in c. albicans; and interestingly unlike in s. cerevisiae, dna repair genes such as ntg <dig>  apn <dig>  ogg <dig>  rad <dig> and rad <dig> do not to play any crucial roles in mutagenesis, genomic stability and drug resistance phenotype in c. albicans  <cit> .
similarly, proteins involved in mismatch repair  and non-homologous end joining  also do not contribute significantly to the candida genomic stability; however defects in double-strand break repair enhance genomic instability  <cit> .
role of dna replication components in genomic stability have not yet been explored in this pathogenic fungus.
thus, to initiate understanding of dna replication in this model organism, in this study we report on the biochemical characterization of capcna as well as its role in dna replication and repair in s. cerevisiae.
RESULTS
identification, sequence analysis and structural comparison of capcna with s. cerevisiae pcna
to identify a putative homologue of s. cerevisiae pcna, the amino acid sequence was used for blast analysis.
blast analysis identified a c. albicans sc <dig> homologue that corresponds to orf <dig>   in cgd with a score of 6e− <dig>  identity of 54 % and similarity of 81 %.
henceforth we refer to this orf as capcna.
interestingly, clustal w alignment analysis showed 42 % and 35 % identity of candida and yeast pcna with that of human, respectively .
in addition, the sequence identity among the pcnas was found throughout the orfs in clusters of three to four amino acids.
capcna sequence encodes a predicted 29 kda protein composed of  <dig> amino acids which is two amino acids shorter than hspcna  but one amino acid longer than scpcna  at its carboxyl terminus.
alignment also showed very high degree of amino acid conservation in the central loop , inter domain connecting loop  as well in the c-terminal tail ; and these domains are known to interact with different protein factors during dna synthesis.
regulatory residues like lys <dig> that undergoes ubiquitylation and sumoylation; and gly <dig> which is involved in stability of the pcna ring are found to be conserved  <cit> .fig.
<dig>
in silico analysis of capcna.
the amino acid alignment and secondary structure prediction were carried out using clustal w and psipred v <dig>  programs, respectively.
identical residues are marked by *, whereas the similar residues are marked with : symbols.
conserved motifs and residues like central loop, idcl, c-terminal tail, k <dig> and g <dig> were shaded grey.
all the theoretically predicted α-helices  and β-strands  of capcna are numbered.
since the sliding clamps from all domains of life possess superimposable three-dimensional structures and primary sequence of capcna showed remarkable similarity, we examined the structure of putative capcna by using in silico approach.
by using swiss model and taking scpcna pdb structures as template, model structure of capcna was predicted .
capcna also forms a toroidal shaped homotrimeric ring, and the superimposition of the modeled complex with the template scpcna showed a root mean square deviation  of  <dig>  Å .
the ramachandran plot showed  <dig>  % residues in the most favoured and  <dig>  % residues in the additional allowed region  confirming the acceptability of the model structure.
in the monomeric structure, capcna is composed of two identical globular domains, one with β1-α1-β2-β3-β4-β5-β6-α2-β7-β8-β <dig> and the other with β10-α3-β11-β12-β13-β14-β15-α4-β16-β17-β <dig>  joined by an idcl .
the minor difference in capcna model structure was noticed in the loop that connects β <dig> and β <dig> at the c-terminal tail .fig.

the red regions indicate “most favored”, yellow colored areas “additional allowed” and white portion represent “disallowed”.
capcna forms a stable homotrimeric ring
to characterize capcna further, the orf was pcr amplified and expressed in bacterial cells.
the orf was in frame with n-terminal gst and a prescision protease site was strategically placed to cleave pcna from gst.
using glutathione sepharose beads as described in methods, wild type and mutant pcna were purified to near homogeneity.
as predicted, capcna  and its g178s mutant migrated relatively slower than scpcna  when analyzed by sds-page .
structural modeling of capcna sequence predicted it to form an oligomer of three subunits, to authenticate the prediction the purified proteins were analyzed by native page.
expectedly, capcna migrated at a position similar to scpcna.
as the latter is a homotrimer, this observation suggested that capcna also forms a stable trimer .
a slightly faster mobility of scpcna may be attributed to its lower pi comparison to capcna.
biochemical and structural characterization of scpcna g178s mutant suggested that g <dig> residue resides in the interface of the two monomers and due to mutation to serine, it destabilizes the pcna ring; therefore it remains mostly as monomer  <cit> .
to ascertain co-migration of wild type capcna with scpcna in native page is because of oligomerisation of monomers and not due to any abnormality in capcna, a g178s mutant protein was further analyzed.
as reported earlier, capcna g178s mutant  migrated faster than the wild type candida and yeast pcna, probably as monomer and suggesting an evolutionary conservation of its role in stabilization of pcna ring.
size exclusion chromatography  confirmed the trimeric nature of the protein as wild type capcna and scpcna eluted around ~90 kda .
however candida g178s mutant pcna eluted much later as ~30 kda  when referred to the molecular weight standards .
further we verified the stability of the pcna trimers by resolving them on a urea containing page .
both candida and budding yeast pcna showed maximum stability in 2 m urea and complete urea dependent denaturation to monomer at 6 m urea.
here the capcna g178s mutant protein served as a marker of monomeric form of pcna .fig.

although all eukaryotic pcnas characterized so far form a stable trimer in vitro, the exact composition of pcna ring in the cell is still not clear as formaldehyde cross-linked cho cells extract or purified human pcna resulted in formation of a double trimeric pcna  <cit> .
mutational analysis suggested the role of r <dig> and k <dig> amino acids of human pcna in doublet-trimer formation.
reagents like formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde cross-links neighboring lysine or arginine residues of monomers by amine bonds to form oligomers.
as these residues  are also conserved in capcna, purified recombinant proteins were cross-linked and analyzed on 12 % sds-page .
like hspcna, capcna showed a smear ranging from ~90-180 kda  whereas g178s pcna mutant migrated in multiple forms by glutaraldehyde cross-linking and predominantly as monomers .
mutant pcna also formed dimeric pcna .
similar results are also obtained with scpcna and its g178s mutant .
in consistent with earlier findings, our study also suggests that pcna from c. albicans and s. cerevisiae may also exist as a double-trimer in the cell.
capcna physically interacts with yeast dna polymerase eta
pcna functions as a docking site for dna polymerases and other proteins during various processes of dna transaction.
in order to function, capcna needs to interact with dna polymerases and other associated proteins.
yeast dna polymerase eta  that takes part in translesion dna synthesis  <cit>  was used as a candidate polymerase for physical interaction study by surface plasmon resonance.
we immobilized capcna or scpcna on a glc- chip to determine the binding affinity for scpolη.
as a control, required amount of bsa was also immobilized.
when scpolη was passed over bsa, we did not see any significant increase in response unit where as it showed ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> ru for scpcna and capcna, as ligands respectively  suggesting the tight binding between pcnas and dna polymerase.
the rate of dissociation of scpolη from scpcna surface  was comparable to that from capcna immobilized surface .
the kd values of capcna and scpcna for scpolη were determined as  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  nm, respectively.fig.
<dig> physical interaction of capcna with scpolη: about 25-500nm of scpolη was injected on capcna or scpcna or bsa immobilized glc chip as indicated with running buffer at a flow rate of 50 μl/min for 180 s with a 600 s dissociation phase.
the dissociation constants were determined.
capcna complements essential function of pol <dig> in s. cerevisiae
pol <dig> gene in any organism is indispensable for cell survival.
because our biochemical and structural modelling studies suggested capcna to be alike of scpcna, it compelled us to examine whether capcna can perform the essential functions of yeast pol <dig> and support cell viability of the genomic null strain.
to achieve our goal capcna was expressed either under its own promoter or under a yeast constitutive promoter adh <dig> in genomic deletion strains of s. cerevisiae but survives due to presence of a plasmid bearing scpcna.
the segregation of plasmids was carried out to replace the scpcna with capcna by two different approaches.
in one approach, yts <dig> strain which is null for genomic pol <dig> but carrying ycp-scpol <dig> de <dig>  42aa-trp <dig> plasmid for survival was used to obtain transformants harbouring various capcna plasmids  on sd media lacking tryptophan and uracil.
attempt to cure the retained plasmid was carried out by repeated sub-culturing of the transformants on sd-uracil liquid media as described in methods.
about  <dig> isolated colonies from each set were streaked on sd-uracil and sd-tryptophan plates.
the percentage of curing of resident plasmid was scored and a representative figure has been shown .
the lack of growth on sd-tryptophan plate but growth on sd-uracil will suggest complete curing of the resident pcna and complementation due to incoming plasmid.
strains containing capcna or its gene in both cen/2 μ vectors were able to replace the resident plasmid , and about 100 % efficient curing was achievable.
similar result was also obtained for incoming scpcna but not for the vector controls as both the nutritional marker phenotypes  were retained .fig.
<dig> complementation analysis of pcnas: a. yts <dig> strains  containing various plasmids were selected on synthetic media without tryptophan and uracil.
these transformants were grown only on liquid media omitting uracil at 30 °c to cure the resident plasmid as described in methods.
after seven such consecutive sub-culturing, presence of the nutritional markers were tested by plating on sd agar plates lacing uracil alone, or tryptophan alone.
plates were incubated for 2 days at 30 °c and photographed.

in the other approach various capcna constructs were transformed into a yeast strain yna <dig> in which the chromosomal pol <dig> gene was deleted and the cell viability was maintained by adh1p-scpcna-ura <dig> based plasmid to allow positive as well as counter selection of this plasmid by 5-foa.
as shown in fig.
6b, cells harboring capcna or scpcna but not the vector control could grow on 5-foa containing sd medium, in which the resident plasmid  was negatively selected .
taken together, we conclude that capcna is able to functionally complement the essential functions of yeast pol <dig> and supports cell viability.
capcna g178s mutant functions differently in yeast
the pol30- <dig>  also known as rev6-1 s. cerevisiae allele that carries a genomic mutation of g <dig> to serine in pcna is well characterized  <cit> .
biochemical characterizations from our study as well as from those of other’s suggested the crucial role of this residue in stabilizing the pcna ring as both candida and yeast g178s mutant proteins remained mostly as monomers in vitro.
although pol30- <dig> allele strain grows normally, surprisingly, candida g178s did not complement the essential function of scpol <dig> when plasmid segregation was carried out in both yts <dig> and yna <dig> strains .
however, the incoming scpcna g178s was able to complement  the cell growth on foa plate.
our observations suggest that presumably scpcna g178s is able to form a dna clamp in vivo, whereas candida mutant is unable to form a functional clamp in yeast.
capcna exhibits slow growth phenotype in yeast and partially complements replication defects caused by hydroxyurea
to analyze the role of capcna in dna replication, growth rates of pol <dig> knock out yeast strains expressing capcna in single to multi-copy plasmids were monitored.
interestingly, strains harbouring capcna formed smaller sized colonies and grew relatively slower than that with wild type scpcna, and accordingly, strain having capcna in a cen plasmid  grew even slower .
as previously reported, we also observed a slow growth phenotype for yts <dig> strain; and the slow growth phenotype was attributed to the weak binding of mutant pcna  with dna and dna polymerases  <cit> .
similarly, yeast strain expressing capcna or scpcna de <dig>  42aa showed temperature sensitivity at 14 °c and 35 °c .
to ascertain the slow growth defects of various yeast strains is not due to the difference in the expression levels of pcnas rather due to the intrinsic properties of capcna, rt-pcr was carried out to check the mrna level of both the pcna.
our result showed that there is no noticeable difference in the expression between the two pcnas under adh <dig> or under its own promoter .
the native expression level of yeast dna polymerase eta was checked and used as a loading control.
the relative fold change of band intensities of pcna vs scpolη varies from ~  <dig>  to  <dig>  .fig.
<dig> growth curves of various yeast strains expressing capcna: a. genomic pol <dig> deletion yeast strains containing yep-adh1p-scpcna , ycp-adh1p-capcna  , yep-adh1p-capcna , and ycp-scpcna gene with de <dig> aa  were grown in 100 ml ypd liquid medium at 30 °c and absorbance at 600 nm were measured at regular intervals.
the plot was an average three sets of experiment.
b. total rna from the above strains were isolated and semi-quantitive reverse trascriptase pcr was carried out.
the pcr products were analyzed in a 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis.
lane  <dig>  1 kb dna ladder; lane  <dig> c-dnas of scpcna de <dig> aa and scpolη; lane  <dig> c-dnas of capcna and scpolη; lane  <dig> c-dnas of scpcna and scpolη; lane  <dig> c-dnas of capcna and scpolη; lane  <dig> no c-dna control reaction.
hydroxyurea depletes cellular dntps level and has been widely used as a replication inhibitor.
when we examined susceptibility of these strains to hu , yeast strain ectopically expressing scpcna  did not show any significant sensitivity up to 50 mm hu, rather surprisingly strain expressing capcna  showed hypersensitivity to similar concentration of hu, as growth was quite adversely affected on ypd plates containing 50 mm hu.
however growth at  <dig>  mm hu for both the strains remained unaffected.
in this assay also both the strains displayed differential growth rates and yeast strain expressing homologous pcna was considerably over-growing the other.
although capcna complemented essential nature of scpol <dig> and was able to support dna replication, it was evident from the growth curve, temperature and hu sensitivity analyses that capcna is not as efficient as scpcna as far as dna replication is concerned in s. cerevisiae.fig.
<dig> sensitivities of s. cerevisiae strains to hu and dna damaging agents.
cells of genomic pol <dig> deletion yeast strains containing yep-adh1p-scpcna or yep-adh1p-capcna from an overnight ypd culture were serially diluted and spotted onto ypd plates without or with indicated concentrations of hu, mms, h2o <dig> and tbhp.
the plates were incubated at 30 °c for 3 days and then photographed.
ectopic expression of capcna caused sensitivity to dna damaging agents in yeast
eukaryotic pcna functions in dna repair in addition to its role in dna replication.
in order to study the function of capcna in dna repair, strains were subjected to various damaging agents like mms, h2o <dig> and tbhp .
like treatment with hu, strains expressing capcna displayed significant sensitivity to these agents than that containing scpcna in yeast.
mms an alkylating agent methylates dna mainly to generate adducts like n7-methylguanine and n3-methyl adenine; and is highly mutagenic.
about  <dig>  % mms is highly toxic to yeast bearing capcna but strain having scpcna showed negligible sensitivity .
h2o <dig> and tbhp increases oxidative stress in a cell and generate oxidized dna lesions.
at 8 mm of these reagents, growth of yeast bearing capcna but not of strain having scpcna was impaired .
taken together, we conclude that capcna is relatively less efficient in coordinating dna repair processes in yeast.
c. albicans is genetically resistant to dna damaging agents in comparison to nonpathogenic s. cerevisiae
heterologous expression of capcna in non-pathogenic s. cerevisiae resulted in sensitivity to dna damaging agents, however during infection c. albicans evades various attacks of ros/rni species generated by innate immune cells  <cit> .
whether in a homologous system capcna provides any protective role, a comparative study of susceptibility by wild type strains of c. albicans and yeast to dna damaging agents was carried out .
when equal number cells were diluted and spotted; interestingly, c. albicans strain sc <dig> which is a commonly used laboratory wild type strain overgrew s. cerevisiae strain emy <dig> , a derivative of widely used dby <dig>  so the retardation of growth rate in fig.
7a where we checked growth rates of yeast containing capcna is not due to the characteristic capcna rather because of lack of species specific interaction with replication components.
despite the differences in the growth rate, candida sc <dig> exhibited moderate sensitivity to hu than yeast emy <dig>  at 50 mm hu, the reason for such a phenotype requires further extensive analysis .
the c. albicans sc <dig> showed tolerance to dna damaging agents like mms, h2o <dig>  and tbhp unlike yeast strain expressing capcna; and at same or lower concentration of reagents, a significant impairment of growth of emy <dig>  was observed.
in a different study, similar results have been reported earlier by using diploid strains of s. cerevisiae by <dig> and c. albicans dkca <dig>  <cit> .
while one copy of pcna gene can be easily deleted from diploid s. cerevisiae, because of haplo-insufficiency similar deletion was not achievable in c. albicans  <cit> .
taken all together we suggest that the fungal pathogen c. albicans is genetically evolved to be resistant to dna damages in comparison to nonpathogenic budding yeast; and capcna dependent dna damage tolerance pathways could play a crucial role in addition to other cellular mechanisms like efficient drug efflux pumps, thicker cell wall and any other components present in c. albicans to maintain genomic stability.fig.
<dig> sensitivities of wild type c. albicans sc <dig> and s. cerevisiae emy <dig>  to hu and dna damaging agents.
cells from an overnight ypd + uridine culture were serially diluted and spotted onto ypd + uridine plates without or with indicated concentrations of hu, mms, h2o <dig> and tbhp.
the plates were incubated at 30 °c for 3 days and then photographed.
discussion
systemic infections caused by candida albicans are life threatening in immune-compromised individuals  <cit> .
in order to kill the microbes, the innate immune cells like macrophages phagocytize candida cells, generate ros/rni that damage dna  <cit> .
therefore c. albicans becomes an interesting model system to understand mechanisms of dna transaction processes and their parallel comparison with well-studied nonpathogenic s. cerevisiae is crucial to unravel the distinct biochemical processes or factors, which may be targeted to control infections/diseases.
for maintenance of genomic stability and cell survival, pcna plays an essential role and regulate recruiting of factors such as dna polymerases during replication, dna repair enzymes, and proteins involved in recombination and cell cycle  <cit> .
the candida genome database annotates c. albicans orf <dig>  as yeast pcna homologue  <cit>  and mrna expression profiling study during cell cycle suggested overexpression of this orf during g1/s transition along with other proteins involved in dna synthesis  <cit> .
separation of proteins from candida cells by 2-d gel electrophoresis revealed an increased amount of capol <dig> when cells were growing exponentially than the stationary phase cells  <cit> .
similarly, genome wide expression profiling in response to fungal drugs like 5-fc suggested increased expression of pol <dig>  <cit> .
tyrosol, a quorum-sensing molecule in c. albicans has also been found to regulate the expression pcna  <cit> .
despite these facts, pcna from c. albicans had not been characterized until this study.
in this report for the first time we have presented an extensive study on cloning and characterization of capcna; and reported functional similarities and differences between capcna and scpcna.
our study suggests that orf <dig>  encodes for a classical eukaryotic dna clamp.
primary sequence and molecular modeling analyses suggest a great degree of conservation in various motifs and the three dimensional structures among pcnas.
like other eukaryotic pcnas, capcna also forms a ring of three monomers; each consisting of two topologically similar globular domains connected by a hydrophobic loop.
the folding of inter domain connecting loop of capcna is also undistinguishable from that of scpcna, as idcl is known to bind to dna polymerases, accordingly a conserved interaction with yeast dna polymerase eta was also established.
for the first time, we designed a urea-page based study to check the stability of pcna ring and found that both candida and yeast pcna were equally resistant to urea dependent denaturation.
glutaraldehyde cross linking experiment also revealed formation of double trimers as has been shown in the case of human pcna  <cit> .
although the exact role of double trimeric pcna ring has not been established, its physiological advantage of interacting with multiple partners at a given time and process can be speculated.
remarkable structural conservation and homology in primary sequences of capcna resulted in complementation of essential function of yeast pcna deletion mutant.
similar observation has been reported for human pcna supporting viability of a schizosaccharomyces pombe deletion mutant  <cit> .
the pcna of drosophila melanogaster but of s. cerevisiae facilitates in vitro dna replication of sv <dig>  <cit> .
this suggests existence of similar interactions between pcna and replicative dna polymerases; and probably the binding sites are also conserved in eukaryotes.
simultaneously, it also implies that scrfc, the clamp loader cannot differentiate capcna against scpcna while loading.
this finding is well supported by an observation that the pcna-partner interaction networks are coevolved in s. cerevisiae and c. albicans due to their highly conserved interaction regions in both pcna and interacting proteins.
therefore pcnas of these two fugal species are in the same compatibility group distinguished from that of y. lipolytica, a. nidulans, n. crassa, and s. pombe  <cit> .
the comparatively slow growth phenotype, susceptibility to non-permissive temperatures and sensitivity to hu of capcna containing yeast strain could be due to absence of some of the critical contacts between capcna and yeast replicative polymerases like polδ or polε  <cit> ; and thereby although supporting dna replication, but with reduced efficiency.
in fact, dmpcna also supports in vitro sv <dig> dna replication with compromised efficiency  <cit> .
however, optimal growth was observed in the wild type candida strains sc <dig> and dkca39; and even better growth rate in comparison to wild type yeast strains suggesting a species-specific interaction between pcna and its partner is beneficial during dna replication.
biochemical studies suggested g178s mutants of candida and yeast pcna behave similarly.
however, capcna g178s mutant did not complement yeast for its deficiency of scpcna whereas the corresponding yeast pcna mutant did.
also the pol30- <dig> of s. cerevisiae allelic strain that carries a genomic mutation of g <dig> to serine mutation in pcna survives and did not show any replication defects  <cit> .
another pcna- <dig> allele which carries s115p mutation and the corresponding purified proteins remaining as monomers during gel filtration and even multimers by crosslinking experiments with glutaraldehyde have also been reported  <cit> .
although these mutant proteins abundantly form monomers and some population of multimers in vitro, apparently in the cell the pcna trimeric rings get stabilized by some yet to be identified mechanism.
an array of site directed and random mutants of scpcna have been extensively studied to understand its differential role in dna replication and repair processes  <cit> .
most of the mutations were on the outer surface of the ring required for protein-protein interactions and exhibited wide range of sensitivity to mms, uv and hu.
one class of mutants like pcna- <dig> , pol30- <dig> , pol30- <dig> , pcna- <dig>  and pcna- <dig>  were susceptible to hydroxyurea, exhibited compromised growth and dna repair defects.
a number of other pcna mutants have also been characterized those are defective in replication also show defects in dna repair.
whereas second class of mutants like pol30- <dig> , pol30- <dig> , pcna- <dig>  and pcna- <dig>  alleles did not show any phenotypes linked to dna replication defects but showed dna repair defects.
particularly, pcna- <dig>  and pcna- <dig>  alleles are defective in mismatch repair.
limitation of these analyses is that most of the pcna that showed defects in replication and repair carry multiple mutations that may alter the structure and property of pcna.
as biochemical characterization of some of these mutant pcnas like pcna- <dig>  pcna- <dig> showed formation of monomeric pcna and compromised interaction with dna repair related proteins  <cit> ; thus it may be argued against the suggestion of separate role of pcna in replication and repair.
therefore similar studies with a naturally occurring eukaryotic pcna will be a novel approach to delineate the precise roles of pcna in dna replication or in repair.
in this study not only we have first time reported characterization of capcna, but also we have presented a naturally occurring pcna form c. albicans whose mere presence in yeast showed characteristics of replication defects like slow growth, smaller colony size, temperature susceptibility and sensitivity to hu; and dna repair defects like sensitivity to dna damages with agents like mms, h2o <dig> and tbhp.
it was unexpected as interestingly, pcna <dig> from a. thaliana plant not only supported viability of pol30Δ s. cerevisiae strain, it also conferred resistance to dna damaging agents  <cit> .
nevertheless, capcna belongs to a class of scpcna mutants like pcna- <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig> and others that show both dna replication and repair defects but support cell viability.
CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that orf <dig>  encodes for a classical eukaryotic dna clamp and shares high degree of similarities in its biochemical and structural features with scpcna.
although both s. cerevisiae and c. albicans belong to same fungal family of saccharomycetaceae and despite both the pcnas possessing common features, capcna is not fully compatible in replacing scpcna in processes like dna replication and repair in yeast.
remarkable tolerance to dna damaging agents phenotype exhibited by c. albicans strains compared to yeast strains suggest that c. albicans being an opportunistic pathogen genetically evolved to tolerate extreme conditions and probably to escape from attack by macrophages to maintain its genomic blue prints.
unlike s. cerevisiae, as ber, ner, mmr and nhej pathways have been ruled out to play a major role in genomic stability in c. albicans  <cit> , pcna coordinating other dna damage tolerance pathways such as replication, translesion dna synthesis and recombination could be playing an important role that requires further investigation.
considering all the evidences, we conclude that despite structural and physiochemical similarities; there are distinct functional differences between scpcna and capcna, and the ways both the strains maintain their genome stability.
hence pcna may play a critical role in the development of systemic candidiasis and targeting pcna could develop a new means to combat c. albicans infection.

generation of pcna constructs
a 50 μl pcr reaction was carried out containing 100 ng of sc <dig> genomic dna, 250 μm dntps, 1 × pfx enzyme buffer,  <dig>  mm mg2so <dig> and 2u of pfx dna polymerase  and 20pmol each of the primers nap <dig>  and nap <dig>  for the orf  <dig> ; and nap <dig>  and nap <dig>  for the gene, respectively.
pcr conditions included initial heating at 95 °c for 3’ followed by 34 cycles at 95 °c for 30s, 48 °c for 45 s, 68 °c for 50s  or 1’ 30s .
amplified pcr products  were purified, digested with hindiii-ecori, and cloned into the same sites of puc <dig>  further the clones were authenticated by sequencing.
the pathogenic yeast c. albicans decodes cug codon as serine instead of leucine, however capcna does not harbour any such codons in its orf; and therefore no further modification was required for expression  <cit> .
the bamhi fragment containing wild type or g178s pcna orf was further subcloned into bglii site of a bacterial expressed amino terminal gst-tag construct.
similar fragments were also subcloned into bamhi site of an adh <dig> promoter based yeast expression system.
the pcna gene was also subcloned to yeast vectors  for complementation analysis.
site directed mutagenesis
g178s mutation was generated on respective puc <dig> constructs by an inverse pcr approach using pfx dna polymerase with primer pairs nap <dig>  and nap <dig>  for capcna; and nap <dig>  and nap <dig>  for scpcna, respectively.
pcr conditions included 1 cycle of 95 °c for 3 min, 20 cycles of 95 °c for 1 min, 50 °c for 30 s, and 68 °c for  <dig>  min, and finally 1 cycle of 68 °c for 10 min.
the pcr product was treated with dpni  overnight and transformed into e.coli tg <dig> competent cells.
the colonies were screened by sequencing.
purification of recombinant proteins
the expression of pcna proteins were carried out in e. coli bl21-de <dig> strain.
the proteins were expressed as glutathione s-transferase fusion proteins under t <dig> promoter by using a protocol described previously  <cit> .
briefly, 10 ml preculture was inoculated into 1lt lb + 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °c to an od <dig> of  <dig> .
further the culture was induced by adding 1 mm iptg, and incubated for an additional  <dig> to 8 h. about 5gm of cell pellet was resuspended in 20 ml cell breaking buffer  containing a 1: <dig> dilution of the protease inhibitor mixture, suspension was pressure lysed using a french press at  <dig>  psi at 4 °c.
the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm for 10 min, and further at  <dig>  rpm for 1 h. the clear supernatant was passed twice through gst beads  packed in 10 ml plastic column.
protein bound beads were first thoroughly washed using the above mentioned buffer with 1 m nacl, and then with equilibration buffer .
the protein was eluted from the beads after overnight incubation with prescission protease  that cleaves pcna from gst.
purified proteins were estimated by both bradford’s and gel based assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard.
proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis on 12 % polyacrylamide gels without or containing either  <dig>  % sds or 2–6 m urea  <cit> , and visualized by coomassie brilliant blue r- <dig> staining .
scpolη was also purified by above mentioned protocol except that gal-pgk-gst-scrad <dig> construct was expressed in yrp <dig> protease deficient yeast strain  <cit> .
glutaraldehyde cross-linking
about 20 μg of native or mutant pcna in 20 mm hepes buffer  was mixed with 1 μl of 8 % freshly prepared glutaraldehyde solution for 5 min at 37 °c.
the reaction was terminated by adding equal volume of 1 m tris–hcl .
cross-linked protein was solubilized with sample buffer and electrophoresis was conducted on 12 % sds-page.
size exclusion chromatography
for size exclusion chromatography, about 10 μg of purified proteins were loaded onto a superdex  <dig> pc <dig> / <dig> column pre-equilibrated with buffer containing 50 mm hepes ph <dig> , 150 mm nacl and 10 % glycerol.
chromatography was performed on an aktapure m system  at a flow rate of  <dig>  ml/min at 4 °c, and the absorbance was monitored at 280 nm.
complementation analysis by plasmid curing
plasmids ycplac <dig>  or yeplac <dig>  harbouring capol <dig> or capol <dig> g178s genes, and yeplac195-scadh1p  expressing capol <dig> or capol <dig> g178s or scpol <dig> orfs were transformed into yts <dig> strain and the transformants were selected on synthetic media without tryptophan and uracil.
for control experiments empty vectors were also transformed.
in order to cure the resident plasmid containing mutant scpol <dig> , a transformant from each plate was grown on liquid media omitting uracil at 30 °c in shaking condition.
after every 24 hrs, 100 μl of the culture was diluted with fresh 5 ml of sd w/o uracil media and allowed to grow.
after seven such consecutive sub-culturing, the cultures were streaked on sd w/o uracil plates to obtain isolated colonies.
about  <dig> isolated colonies were patched on both sd agar plates lacing uracil alone or tryptophan alone.
further the plates were incubated at 30 °c for 2 days and number of colonies appeared on each plates were counted.
the lack of growth on sd-tryptophan plate but growth on sd-uracil suggested complete curing of the resident pcna and complementation due to the incoming plasmid.
on the other hand, preservation of both the nutritional markers  indicated that the tester plasmid is unable to complement for scpol <dig>  after curing, the strains were confirmed by pcr for the presence of respective plasmids.
plasmid segregation by 5-foa counter selection
yeast strain yna <dig> is a genomic null for pol <dig> but harbors yeplac195-scadh1p-scpol <dig> .
an empty yeplac181-scadh1p  or containing capol <dig> or capol <dig> g178s or scpol <dig> g178s orfs were transformed into above strain.
candida pcna with its own promoter in yeplac <dig> vector was also transformed.
the transformants were streaked on sd media w/o leucine and uracil.
isolated colonies were picked and re-streaked on sd-leucine agar plate but with or without 5′-fluoroorotic acid .
after counter selection with 5′-foa, the absence of original pcna in strains surviving on foa containing plate was confirmed by pcr.
growth rates
growth rates for yeast strains were examined by inoculating the required volume of pre-culture to 100 ml fresh ypd liquid medium to get  <dig>  o.d <dig> at 0 h. about 1 ml culture was taken out in every 1 h for 18 hrs and the growth rate at 30 °c was monitored by measuring absorbance at 600 nm.
growth of the strains was also monitored at 14 °c and 35 °c.
rt-pcr analysis
total rnas were isolated from various yeast stains those were used in estimating growth rates by using mp fastrna pro isolation kit  as per the manufacturer’s protocol and then samples were treated with dnaase i enzyme.
equal amount of rnas were subjected to cdna synthesis using a reverse transcription core kit from eurogentec .
a 50 μl pcr reaction was carried out containing 3 μl of synthesized c-dna, 200 μm dntps, 1 × taq dna polymerase buffer,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig> and 2u of taq dna polymerase  and 20pmol each of the primers nap <dig>  and nap <dig>  for the capcna; and nap <dig>  and nap <dig>  for the scpcna, respectively.
primers pair nap <dig>  and nap <dig>  were used for amplification of scpolη.
pcr conditions included initial heating at 95 °c for 3’ followed by 25 cycles at 95 °c for 30s, 52 °c for 45 s, 68 °c for 1’  or 1’ 45 s .
pcr products were separated on 1 % agarose gel and image captured on chemi xrs gel documentation system .
pcr reaction was also repeated with rna alone as template to rule out any genomic dna contamination in our preparation.
intensity of each band was calculated by imagej software and relative fold change of pcna vs polη was estimated.
sensitivity to different dna damaging agents
all the pre-cultures of various strains were diluted to achieve equal number of cells in autoclaved water.
further these strains were  <dig> folds serially diluted and spotted on ypd plates containing with or without different concentrations of drugs like hydroxyurea , methyl methane sulfonate , h2o <dig> and tert-butyl hydroperoxide .
the plates were incubated at 30 °c for 3 days and then photographed.
uridine  was added when required.
physical interaction by surface plasmon resonance
interaction of pcna with dna polymerase eta  was monitored using bio-rad xpr  <dig> surface plasmon resonance biosensor instrument.
about 5 μg of capcna or scpcna or bsa  was immobilized on glc chip by amine coupling method as suggested by manufacturer’s instructions.
scpolη was injected at concentration ranging from 25-500nm with running buffer composed of 25 mm hepes ph  <dig> , 10 % glycerol, 200 mm sodium acetate ph  <dig> , 8 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dtt,  <dig>  % tween- <dig> and  <dig>  mg/ml bsa, at a flow rate of 50 μl/min for 180 s with a 600 s dissociation phase.
molecular interaction was carried out at 20 °c.
further the dissociation constants were determined, after fitting the association and dissociation curves to a 1: <dig> -binding model.
bioinformatics analysis of candida pcna
the blast server from the ncbi was used to search for similarities between candida pcna protein and sequences deposited in the protein databank .
based on the structures of homologues proteins, capcna was modelled using swiss model   <cit> , an automated protein modelling server.
saccharomyces cerevisiae pcna pdb structures with id 2od <dig> and 1plr were used as template for monomeric and trimeric pcna, respectively.
stereochemical quality of the model structured of capcna was further analysed by the metaserver saves.
the ramachandran plot was derived by procheck and secondary structure prediction of capcna was performed with psipred v <dig>  softwares  <cit> .

",980,"BACKGROUND
proliferating cellular nuclear antigen , an evolutionarily conserved protein found in eukaryotes and archaebacteria serves as a docking platform for many proteins that function in dna replication, repair, recombination, cell cycle, and chromatin remodeling  <cit> . it belongs to a family of sliding clamps that increase processivity of replicative dna polymerases  <cit> . despite little sequence similarity among the sliding clamps in all domains of life, they possess superimposable three-dimensional structures with highly conserved functions  <cit> . a typical sliding clamp comprises of multimeric, toroidal-shaped structures with pseudo-six fold symmetry that encircles the dna double helix  <cit> . while β-clamp, the sliding clamp of eubacteria is a homodimer; pcna of eukaryotes and t <dig> bacteriophage is a homotrimer, and a heterotrimer in archaea  <cit> . each pcna monomer consists of two globular topologically identical domains connected by an inter domain connecting loop . the three dimensional structure reveals that the inner surface of the pcna ring is comprised of  <dig> α-helices with suitably exposed positively charged amino acids to interact with the sugar-phosphate backbone of dna, whereas the outer surface is composed of  <dig> β-sheets and three idcls appropriate for protein–protein interactions  <cit> . pcna by itself cannot directly encircle dna; rather it is loaded by a eukaryotic clamp loader, rfc  <cit> . the loaded pcna ring only recruits polymerases and other factors firmly to dna, making the sliding clamp an essential cofactor for dna transaction processes. apart from dna polymerases, pcna is found to interact with proteins such as fen <dig>  dna glycosylases, dna ligase i, p <dig>  cck <dig>  cyclin d, dna methyltransferases etc. . pcna interacts with its partners mostly through its idcl but occasionally by its c-terminus, the center loop and the backside loop  <cit>  .

mutational analysis of yeast pcna has suggested separate roles for pcna in dna replication and repairs  <cit> . for example; pcna mutants like pol30- <dig>  and pol30- <dig>  show sensitivity to dna methylating agents and uv light, however they grow normally on medium containing a replication inhibitor hydroxyurea, and do not elicit any temperature sensitivity. similarly pcna- <dig>  and pcna- <dig>  alleles generate frame-shift and substitution mutations due to reduced mmr efficiency but do not show any defects in replication or other repair processes. in vitro binding studies revealed a compromised interaction of these mutant proteins with msh <dig> and msh <dig> proteins. a number of pcna mutants have also been characterized those are defective in both dna replication and repair processes. alleles like pcna- <dig> that has il <dig>  128aa mutations in the idcl, and pcna- <dig> that carries pk <dig>  253aa mutations in the carboxyl terminal tail exhibit growth defects, elevated sensitivity to dna-damaging agents, and higher rates of spontaneous mutations  <cit> . biochemical characterization of some of these mutant pcnas e.g. pcna- <dig> often showed structural alteration and reduced stability of the trimeric ring  <cit> .

pcna has been characterized in human, rat, budding and fission yeasts, protozoan, flies, arabidopsis, and many archaeal species . however, no such studies of pcna from pathogenic candida albicans or any other candida species have been carried out till date. c. albicans, an opportunistic pathogen, which asymptomatically colonizes humans, can cause severe infection in immounocompromised people or when the microbiotic balance is disturbed  <cit> . systemic fungal infections by c. albicans are life threatening and of great concern to human health  <cit> . study of the fundamental cellular processes such as dna replication, repair and recombination in this pathogenic yeast and their parallel comparison with nonpathogenic s. cerevisiae is crucial to unravel the distinct biochemical processes or factors, which may be targeted to control infections/diseases. dna repair mechanisms like base excision repair  and nucleotide excision repair  are well studied in c. albicans; and interestingly unlike in s. cerevisiae, dna repair genes such as ntg <dig>  apn <dig>  ogg <dig>  rad <dig> and rad <dig> do not to play any crucial roles in mutagenesis, genomic stability and drug resistance phenotype in c. albicans  <cit> . similarly, proteins involved in mismatch repair  and non-homologous end joining  also do not contribute significantly to the candida genomic stability; however defects in double-strand break repair enhance genomic instability  <cit> . role of dna replication components in genomic stability have not yet been explored in this pathogenic fungus. thus, to initiate understanding of dna replication in this model organism, in this study we report on the biochemical characterization of capcna as well as its role in dna replication and repair in s. cerevisiae.

RESULTS
identification, sequence analysis and structural comparison of capcna with s. cerevisiae pcna
to identify a putative homologue of s. cerevisiae pcna, the amino acid sequence was used for blast analysis. blast analysis identified a c. albicans sc <dig> homologue that corresponds to orf <dig>   in cgd with a score of 6e− <dig>  identity of 54 % and similarity of 81 %. henceforth we refer to this orf as capcna. interestingly, clustal w alignment analysis showed 42 % and 35 % identity of candida and yeast pcna with that of human, respectively . in addition, the sequence identity among the pcnas was found throughout the orfs in clusters of three to four amino acids. capcna sequence encodes a predicted 29 kda protein composed of  <dig> amino acids which is two amino acids shorter than hspcna  but one amino acid longer than scpcna  at its carboxyl terminus. alignment also showed very high degree of amino acid conservation in the central loop , inter domain connecting loop  as well in the c-terminal tail ; and these domains are known to interact with different protein factors during dna synthesis. regulatory residues like lys <dig> that undergoes ubiquitylation and sumoylation; and gly <dig> which is involved in stability of the pcna ring are found to be conserved  <cit> .fig.  <dig> 
in silico analysis of capcna. the amino acid alignment and secondary structure prediction were carried out using clustal w and psipred v <dig>  programs, respectively. identical residues are marked by *, whereas the similar residues are marked with : symbols. conserved motifs and residues like central loop, idcl, c-terminal tail, k <dig> and g <dig> were shaded grey. all the theoretically predicted α-helices  and β-strands  of capcna are numbered.



since the sliding clamps from all domains of life possess superimposable three-dimensional structures and primary sequence of capcna showed remarkable similarity, we examined the structure of putative capcna by using in silico approach. by using swiss model and taking scpcna pdb structures as template, model structure of capcna was predicted . capcna also forms a toroidal shaped homotrimeric ring, and the superimposition of the modeled complex with the template scpcna showed a root mean square deviation  of  <dig>  Å . the ramachandran plot showed  <dig>  % residues in the most favoured and  <dig>  % residues in the additional allowed region  confirming the acceptability of the model structure. in the monomeric structure, capcna is composed of two identical globular domains, one with β1-α1-β2-β3-β4-β5-β6-α2-β7-β8-β <dig> and the other with β10-α3-β11-β12-β13-β14-β15-α4-β16-β17-β <dig>  joined by an idcl . the minor difference in capcna model structure was noticed in the loop that connects β <dig> and β <dig> at the c-terminal tail .fig.  <dig> model structure of capcna.

capcna forms a stable homotrimeric ring
to characterize capcna further, the orf was pcr amplified and expressed in bacterial cells. the orf was in frame with n-terminal gst and a prescision protease site was strategically placed to cleave pcna from gst. using glutathione sepharose beads as described in methods, wild type and mutant pcna were purified to near homogeneity. as predicted, capcna  and its g178s mutant migrated relatively slower than scpcna  when analyzed by sds-page . structural modeling of capcna sequence predicted it to form an oligomer of three subunits, to authenticate the prediction the purified proteins were analyzed by native page. expectedly, capcna migrated at a position similar to scpcna. as the latter is a homotrimer, this observation suggested that capcna also forms a stable trimer . a slightly faster mobility of scpcna may be attributed to its lower pi comparison to capcna. biochemical and structural characterization of scpcna g178s mutant suggested that g <dig> residue resides in the interface of the two monomers and due to mutation to serine, it destabilizes the pcna ring; therefore it remains mostly as monomer  <cit> . to ascertain co-migration of wild type capcna with scpcna in native page is because of oligomerisation of monomers and not due to any abnormality in capcna, a g178s mutant protein was further analyzed. as reported earlier, capcna g178s mutant  migrated faster than the wild type candida and yeast pcna, probably as monomer and suggesting an evolutionary conservation of its role in stabilization of pcna ring. size exclusion chromatography  confirmed the trimeric nature of the protein as wild type capcna and scpcna eluted around ~90 kda . however candida g178s mutant pcna eluted much later as ~30 kda  when referred to the molecular weight standards . further we verified the stability of the pcna trimers by resolving them on a urea containing page . both candida and budding yeast pcna showed maximum stability in 2 m urea and complete urea dependent denaturation to monomer at 6 m urea. here the capcna g178s mutant protein served as a marker of monomeric form of pcna .fig.  <dig> purification and biochemical analysis of pcnas. the wild type and mutant pcnas were purified and ~1 μg of each protein was analyzed. a

although all eukaryotic pcnas characterized so far form a stable trimer in vitro, the exact composition of pcna ring in the cell is still not clear as formaldehyde cross-linked cho cells extract or purified human pcna resulted in formation of a double trimeric pcna  <cit> . mutational analysis suggested the role of r <dig> and k <dig> amino acids of human pcna in doublet-trimer formation. reagents like formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde cross-links neighboring lysine or arginine residues of monomers by amine bonds to form oligomers. as these residues  are also conserved in capcna, purified recombinant proteins were cross-linked and analyzed on 12 % sds-page . like hspcna, capcna showed a smear ranging from ~90-180 kda  whereas g178s pcna mutant migrated in multiple forms by glutaraldehyde cross-linking and predominantly as monomers . mutant pcna also formed dimeric pcna . similar results are also obtained with scpcna and its g178s mutant . in consistent with earlier findings, our study also suggests that pcna from c. albicans and s. cerevisiae may also exist as a double-trimer in the cell.

capcna physically interacts with yeast dna polymerase eta 
pcna functions as a docking site for dna polymerases and other proteins during various processes of dna transaction. in order to function, capcna needs to interact with dna polymerases and other associated proteins. yeast dna polymerase eta  that takes part in translesion dna synthesis  <cit>  was used as a candidate polymerase for physical interaction study by surface plasmon resonance. we immobilized capcna or scpcna on a glc- chip to determine the binding affinity for scpolη. as a control, required amount of bsa was also immobilized. when scpolη was passed over bsa, we did not see any significant increase in response unit where as it showed ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> ru for scpcna and capcna, as ligands respectively  suggesting the tight binding between pcnas and dna polymerase. the rate of dissociation of scpolη from scpcna surface  was comparable to that from capcna immobilized surface . the kd values of capcna and scpcna for scpolη were determined as  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  nm, respectively.fig.  <dig> physical interaction of capcna with scpolη: about 25-500nm of scpolη was injected on capcna or scpcna or bsa immobilized glc chip as indicated with running buffer at a flow rate of 50 μl/min for 180 s with a 600 s dissociation phase. the dissociation constants were determined.



capcna complements essential function of pol <dig> in s. cerevisiae
pol <dig> gene in any organism is indispensable for cell survival. because our biochemical and structural modelling studies suggested capcna to be alike of scpcna, it compelled us to examine whether capcna can perform the essential functions of yeast pol <dig> and support cell viability of the genomic null strain. to achieve our goal capcna was expressed either under its own promoter or under a yeast constitutive promoter adh <dig> in genomic deletion strains of s. cerevisiae but survives due to presence of a plasmid bearing scpcna. the segregation of plasmids was carried out to replace the scpcna with capcna by two different approaches. in one approach, yts <dig> strain which is null for genomic pol <dig> but carrying ycp-scpol <dig> de <dig>  42aa-trp <dig> plasmid for survival was used to obtain transformants harbouring various capcna plasmids  on sd media lacking tryptophan and uracil. attempt to cure the retained plasmid was carried out by repeated sub-culturing of the transformants on sd-uracil liquid media as described in methods. about  <dig> isolated colonies from each set were streaked on sd-uracil and sd-tryptophan plates. the percentage of curing of resident plasmid was scored and a representative figure has been shown . the lack of growth on sd-tryptophan plate but growth on sd-uracil will suggest complete curing of the resident pcna and complementation due to incoming plasmid. strains containing capcna or its gene in both cen/2 μ vectors were able to replace the resident plasmid , and about 100 % efficient curing was achievable. similar result was also obtained for incoming scpcna but not for the vector controls as both the nutritional marker phenotypes  were retained .fig.  <dig> complementation analysis of pcnas: a. yts <dig> strains  containing various plasmids were selected on synthetic media without tryptophan and uracil. these transformants were grown only on liquid media omitting uracil at 30 °c to cure the resident plasmid as described in methods. after seven such consecutive sub-culturing, presence of the nutritional markers were tested by plating on sd agar plates lacing uracil alone, or tryptophan alone. plates were incubated for 2 days at 30 °c and photographed. sectors  <dig> &  <dig>  empty vectors;  <dig>  2 μ, adh1p-capcna, ura3;  <dig>  2 μ, adh1p-capcna g178s, ura3;  <dig>  2 μ, adh1p-scpcna, ura3;  <dig>  2 μ, capcna gene, ura3;  <dig>  2 μ, capcna gene g178s, ura3;  <dig>  cen, capcnagene, ura3; and  <dig>  cen, capcnagene g178s, ura <dig>  b. the transformants of yeast strain yna <dig>  containing various plasmids were selected on sd media w/o leucine and uracil. isolated colonies were picked and re-streaked on sd-leucine plate but with or without 5-foa. sectors  <dig>  empty vector;  <dig>  2 μ, adh1p-scpcna g178s, leu2;  <dig>  2 μ, adh1p-scpcna, leu2;  <dig>  2 μ, adh1p-capcna, leu2;  <dig>  2 μ, capcna g178s, leu2;  <dig>  2 μ,capcna gene, leu <dig> 



in the other approach various capcna constructs were transformed into a yeast strain yna <dig> in which the chromosomal pol <dig> gene was deleted and the cell viability was maintained by adh1p-scpcna-ura <dig> based plasmid to allow positive as well as counter selection of this plasmid by 5-foa. as shown in fig. 6b, cells harboring capcna or scpcna but not the vector control could grow on 5-foa containing sd medium, in which the resident plasmid  was negatively selected . taken together, we conclude that capcna is able to functionally complement the essential functions of yeast pol <dig> and supports cell viability.

capcna g178s mutant functions differently in yeast
the pol30- <dig>  also known as rev6-1 s. cerevisiae allele that carries a genomic mutation of g <dig> to serine in pcna is well characterized  <cit> . biochemical characterizations from our study as well as from those of other’s suggested the crucial role of this residue in stabilizing the pcna ring as both candida and yeast g178s mutant proteins remained mostly as monomers in vitro. although pol30- <dig> allele strain grows normally, surprisingly, candida g178s did not complement the essential function of scpol <dig> when plasmid segregation was carried out in both yts <dig> and yna <dig> strains . however, the incoming scpcna g178s was able to complement  the cell growth on foa plate. our observations suggest that presumably scpcna g178s is able to form a dna clamp in vivo, whereas candida mutant is unable to form a functional clamp in yeast.

capcna exhibits slow growth phenotype in yeast and partially complements replication defects caused by hydroxyurea
to analyze the role of capcna in dna replication, growth rates of pol <dig> knock out yeast strains expressing capcna in single to multi-copy plasmids were monitored. interestingly, strains harbouring capcna formed smaller sized colonies and grew relatively slower than that with wild type scpcna, and accordingly, strain having capcna in a cen plasmid  grew even slower . as previously reported, we also observed a slow growth phenotype for yts <dig> strain; and the slow growth phenotype was attributed to the weak binding of mutant pcna  with dna and dna polymerases  <cit> . similarly, yeast strain expressing capcna or scpcna de <dig>  42aa showed temperature sensitivity at 14 °c and 35 °c . to ascertain the slow growth defects of various yeast strains is not due to the difference in the expression levels of pcnas rather due to the intrinsic properties of capcna, rt-pcr was carried out to check the mrna level of both the pcna. our result showed that there is no noticeable difference in the expression between the two pcnas under adh <dig> or under its own promoter . the native expression level of yeast dna polymerase eta was checked and used as a loading control. the relative fold change of band intensities of pcna vs scpolη varies from ~  <dig>  to  <dig>  .fig.  <dig> growth curves of various yeast strains expressing capcna: a. genomic pol <dig> deletion yeast strains containing yep-adh1p-scpcna , ycp-adh1p-capcna  , yep-adh1p-capcna , and ycp-scpcna gene with de <dig> aa  were grown in 100 ml ypd liquid medium at 30 °c and absorbance at 600 nm were measured at regular intervals. the plot was an average three sets of experiment. b. total rna from the above strains were isolated and semi-quantitive reverse trascriptase pcr was carried out. the pcr products were analyzed in a 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis. lane  <dig>  1 kb dna ladder; lane  <dig> c-dnas of scpcna de <dig> aa and scpolη; lane  <dig> c-dnas of capcna and scpolη; lane  <dig> c-dnas of scpcna and scpolη; lane  <dig> c-dnas of capcna and scpolη; lane  <dig> no c-dna control reaction.



hydroxyurea depletes cellular dntps level and has been widely used as a replication inhibitor. when we examined susceptibility of these strains to hu , yeast strain ectopically expressing scpcna  did not show any significant sensitivity up to 50 mm hu, rather surprisingly strain expressing capcna  showed hypersensitivity to similar concentration of hu, as growth was quite adversely affected on ypd plates containing 50 mm hu. however growth at  <dig>  mm hu for both the strains remained unaffected. in this assay also both the strains displayed differential growth rates and yeast strain expressing homologous pcna was considerably over-growing the other. although capcna complemented essential nature of scpol <dig> and was able to support dna replication, it was evident from the growth curve, temperature and hu sensitivity analyses that capcna is not as efficient as scpcna as far as dna replication is concerned in s. cerevisiae.fig.  <dig> sensitivities of s. cerevisiae strains to hu and dna damaging agents. cells of genomic pol <dig> deletion yeast strains containing yep-adh1p-scpcna or yep-adh1p-capcna from an overnight ypd culture were serially diluted and spotted onto ypd plates without or with indicated concentrations of hu, mms, h2o <dig> and tbhp. the plates were incubated at 30 °c for 3 days and then photographed.



ectopic expression of capcna caused sensitivity to dna damaging agents in yeast
eukaryotic pcna functions in dna repair in addition to its role in dna replication. in order to study the function of capcna in dna repair, strains were subjected to various damaging agents like mms, h2o <dig> and tbhp . like treatment with hu, strains expressing capcna displayed significant sensitivity to these agents than that containing scpcna in yeast. mms an alkylating agent methylates dna mainly to generate adducts like n7-methylguanine and n3-methyl adenine; and is highly mutagenic. about  <dig>  % mms is highly toxic to yeast bearing capcna but strain having scpcna showed negligible sensitivity . h2o <dig> and tbhp increases oxidative stress in a cell and generate oxidized dna lesions. at 8 mm of these reagents, growth of yeast bearing capcna but not of strain having scpcna was impaired . taken together, we conclude that capcna is relatively less efficient in coordinating dna repair processes in yeast.

c. albicans is genetically resistant to dna damaging agents in comparison to nonpathogenic s. cerevisiae
heterologous expression of capcna in non-pathogenic s. cerevisiae resulted in sensitivity to dna damaging agents, however during infection c. albicans evades various attacks of ros/rni species generated by innate immune cells  <cit> . whether in a homologous system capcna provides any protective role, a comparative study of susceptibility by wild type strains of c. albicans and yeast to dna damaging agents was carried out . when equal number cells were diluted and spotted; interestingly, c. albicans strain sc <dig> which is a commonly used laboratory wild type strain overgrew s. cerevisiae strain emy <dig> , a derivative of widely used dby <dig>  so the retardation of growth rate in fig. 7a where we checked growth rates of yeast containing capcna is not due to the characteristic capcna rather because of lack of species specific interaction with replication components. despite the differences in the growth rate, candida sc <dig> exhibited moderate sensitivity to hu than yeast emy <dig>  at 50 mm hu, the reason for such a phenotype requires further extensive analysis . the c. albicans sc <dig> showed tolerance to dna damaging agents like mms, h2o <dig>  and tbhp unlike yeast strain expressing capcna; and at same or lower concentration of reagents, a significant impairment of growth of emy <dig>  was observed. in a different study, similar results have been reported earlier by using diploid strains of s. cerevisiae by <dig> and c. albicans dkca <dig>  <cit> . while one copy of pcna gene can be easily deleted from diploid s. cerevisiae, because of haplo-insufficiency similar deletion was not achievable in c. albicans  <cit> . taken all together we suggest that the fungal pathogen c. albicans is genetically evolved to be resistant to dna damages in comparison to nonpathogenic budding yeast; and capcna dependent dna damage tolerance pathways could play a crucial role in addition to other cellular mechanisms like efficient drug efflux pumps, thicker cell wall and any other components present in c. albicans to maintain genomic stability.fig.  <dig> sensitivities of wild type c. albicans sc <dig> and s. cerevisiae emy <dig>  to hu and dna damaging agents. cells from an overnight ypd + uridine culture were serially diluted and spotted onto ypd + uridine plates without or with indicated concentrations of hu, mms, h2o <dig> and tbhp. the plates were incubated at 30 °c for 3 days and then photographed.



discussion
systemic infections caused by candida albicans are life threatening in immune-compromised individuals  <cit> . in order to kill the microbes, the innate immune cells like macrophages phagocytize candida cells, generate ros/rni that damage dna  <cit> . therefore c. albicans becomes an interesting model system to understand mechanisms of dna transaction processes and their parallel comparison with well-studied nonpathogenic s. cerevisiae is crucial to unravel the distinct biochemical processes or factors, which may be targeted to control infections/diseases. for maintenance of genomic stability and cell survival, pcna plays an essential role and regulate recruiting of factors such as dna polymerases during replication, dna repair enzymes, and proteins involved in recombination and cell cycle  <cit> . the candida genome database annotates c. albicans orf <dig>  as yeast pcna homologue  <cit>  and mrna expression profiling study during cell cycle suggested overexpression of this orf during g1/s transition along with other proteins involved in dna synthesis  <cit> . separation of proteins from candida cells by 2-d gel electrophoresis revealed an increased amount of capol <dig> when cells were growing exponentially than the stationary phase cells  <cit> . similarly, genome wide expression profiling in response to fungal drugs like 5-fc suggested increased expression of pol <dig>  <cit> . tyrosol, a quorum-sensing molecule in c. albicans has also been found to regulate the expression pcna  <cit> . despite these facts, pcna from c. albicans had not been characterized until this study. in this report for the first time we have presented an extensive study on cloning and characterization of capcna; and reported functional similarities and differences between capcna and scpcna.

our study suggests that orf <dig>  encodes for a classical eukaryotic dna clamp. primary sequence and molecular modeling analyses suggest a great degree of conservation in various motifs and the three dimensional structures among pcnas. like other eukaryotic pcnas, capcna also forms a ring of three monomers; each consisting of two topologically similar globular domains connected by a hydrophobic loop. the folding of inter domain connecting loop of capcna is also undistinguishable from that of scpcna, as idcl is known to bind to dna polymerases, accordingly a conserved interaction with yeast dna polymerase eta was also established. for the first time, we designed a urea-page based study to check the stability of pcna ring and found that both candida and yeast pcna were equally resistant to urea dependent denaturation. glutaraldehyde cross linking experiment also revealed formation of double trimers as has been shown in the case of human pcna  <cit> . although the exact role of double trimeric pcna ring has not been established, its physiological advantage of interacting with multiple partners at a given time and process can be speculated.

remarkable structural conservation and homology in primary sequences of capcna resulted in complementation of essential function of yeast pcna deletion mutant. similar observation has been reported for human pcna supporting viability of a schizosaccharomyces pombe deletion mutant  <cit> . the pcna of drosophila melanogaster but of s. cerevisiae facilitates in vitro dna replication of sv <dig>  <cit> . this suggests existence of similar interactions between pcna and replicative dna polymerases; and probably the binding sites are also conserved in eukaryotes. simultaneously, it also implies that scrfc, the clamp loader cannot differentiate capcna against scpcna while loading. this finding is well supported by an observation that the pcna-partner interaction networks are coevolved in s. cerevisiae and c. albicans due to their highly conserved interaction regions in both pcna and interacting proteins. therefore pcnas of these two fugal species are in the same compatibility group distinguished from that of y. lipolytica, a. nidulans, n. crassa, and s. pombe  <cit> . the comparatively slow growth phenotype, susceptibility to non-permissive temperatures and sensitivity to hu of capcna containing yeast strain could be due to absence of some of the critical contacts between capcna and yeast replicative polymerases like polδ or polε  <cit> ; and thereby although supporting dna replication, but with reduced efficiency. in fact, dmpcna also supports in vitro sv <dig> dna replication with compromised efficiency  <cit> . however, optimal growth was observed in the wild type candida strains sc <dig> and dkca39; and even better growth rate in comparison to wild type yeast strains suggesting a species-specific interaction between pcna and its partner is beneficial during dna replication. biochemical studies suggested g178s mutants of candida and yeast pcna behave similarly. however, capcna g178s mutant did not complement yeast for its deficiency of scpcna whereas the corresponding yeast pcna mutant did. also the pol30- <dig> of s. cerevisiae allelic strain that carries a genomic mutation of g <dig> to serine mutation in pcna survives and did not show any replication defects  <cit> . another pcna- <dig> allele which carries s115p mutation and the corresponding purified proteins remaining as monomers during gel filtration and even multimers by crosslinking experiments with glutaraldehyde have also been reported  <cit> . although these mutant proteins abundantly form monomers and some population of multimers in vitro, apparently in the cell the pcna trimeric rings get stabilized by some yet to be identified mechanism.

an array of site directed and random mutants of scpcna have been extensively studied to understand its differential role in dna replication and repair processes  <cit> . most of the mutations were on the outer surface of the ring required for protein-protein interactions and exhibited wide range of sensitivity to mms, uv and hu. one class of mutants like pcna- <dig> , pol30- <dig> , pol30- <dig> , pcna- <dig>  and pcna- <dig>  were susceptible to hydroxyurea, exhibited compromised growth and dna repair defects. a number of other pcna mutants have also been characterized those are defective in replication also show defects in dna repair. whereas second class of mutants like pol30- <dig> , pol30- <dig> , pcna- <dig>  and pcna- <dig>  alleles did not show any phenotypes linked to dna replication defects but showed dna repair defects. particularly, pcna- <dig>  and pcna- <dig>  alleles are defective in mismatch repair. limitation of these analyses is that most of the pcna that showed defects in replication and repair carry multiple mutations that may alter the structure and property of pcna. as biochemical characterization of some of these mutant pcnas like pcna- <dig>  pcna- <dig> showed formation of monomeric pcna and compromised interaction with dna repair related proteins  <cit> ; thus it may be argued against the suggestion of separate role of pcna in replication and repair. therefore similar studies with a naturally occurring eukaryotic pcna will be a novel approach to delineate the precise roles of pcna in dna replication or in repair. in this study not only we have first time reported characterization of capcna, but also we have presented a naturally occurring pcna form c. albicans whose mere presence in yeast showed characteristics of replication defects like slow growth, smaller colony size, temperature susceptibility and sensitivity to hu; and dna repair defects like sensitivity to dna damages with agents like mms, h2o <dig> and tbhp. it was unexpected as interestingly, pcna <dig> from a. thaliana plant not only supported viability of pol30Δ s. cerevisiae strain, it also conferred resistance to dna damaging agents  <cit> . nevertheless, capcna belongs to a class of scpcna mutants like pcna- <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig> and others that show both dna replication and repair defects but support cell viability.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that orf <dig>  encodes for a classical eukaryotic dna clamp and shares high degree of similarities in its biochemical and structural features with scpcna. although both s. cerevisiae and c. albicans belong to same fungal family of saccharomycetaceae and despite both the pcnas possessing common features, capcna is not fully compatible in replacing scpcna in processes like dna replication and repair in yeast. remarkable tolerance to dna damaging agents phenotype exhibited by c. albicans strains compared to yeast strains suggest that c. albicans being an opportunistic pathogen genetically evolved to tolerate extreme conditions and probably to escape from attack by macrophages to maintain its genomic blue prints. unlike s. cerevisiae, as ber, ner, mmr and nhej pathways have been ruled out to play a major role in genomic stability in c. albicans  <cit> , pcna coordinating other dna damage tolerance pathways such as replication, translesion dna synthesis and recombination could be playing an important role that requires further investigation. considering all the evidences, we conclude that despite structural and physiochemical similarities; there are distinct functional differences between scpcna and capcna, and the ways both the strains maintain their genome stability. hence pcna may play a critical role in the development of systemic candidiasis and targeting pcna could develop a new means to combat c. albicans infection.

generation of pcna constructs
a 50 μl pcr reaction was carried out containing 100 ng of sc <dig> genomic dna, 250 μm dntps, 1 × pfx enzyme buffer,  <dig>  mm mg2so <dig> and 2u of pfx dna polymerase  and 20pmol each of the primers nap <dig>  and nap <dig>  for the orf  <dig> ; and nap <dig>  and nap <dig>  for the gene, respectively. pcr conditions included initial heating at 95 °c for 3’ followed by 34 cycles at 95 °c for 30s, 48 °c for 45 s, 68 °c for 50s  or 1’ 30s . amplified pcr products  were purified, digested with hindiii-ecori, and cloned into the same sites of puc <dig>  further the clones were authenticated by sequencing. the pathogenic yeast c. albicans decodes cug codon as serine instead of leucine, however capcna does not harbour any such codons in its orf; and therefore no further modification was required for expression  <cit> . the bamhi fragment containing wild type or g178s pcna orf was further subcloned into bglii site of a bacterial expressed amino terminal gst-tag construct. similar fragments were also subcloned into bamhi site of an adh <dig> promoter based yeast expression system. the pcna gene was also subcloned to yeast vectors  for complementation analysis.

site directed mutagenesis
g178s mutation was generated on respective puc <dig> constructs by an inverse pcr approach using pfx dna polymerase with primer pairs nap <dig>  and nap <dig>  for capcna; and nap <dig>  and nap <dig>  for scpcna, respectively. pcr conditions included 1 cycle of 95 °c for 3 min, 20 cycles of 95 °c for 1 min, 50 °c for 30 s, and 68 °c for  <dig>  min, and finally 1 cycle of 68 °c for 10 min. the pcr product was treated with dpni  overnight and transformed into e.coli tg <dig> competent cells. the colonies were screened by sequencing.

purification of recombinant proteins
the expression of pcna proteins were carried out in e. coli bl21-de <dig> strain. the proteins were expressed as glutathione s-transferase fusion proteins under t <dig> promoter by using a protocol described previously  <cit> . briefly, 10 ml preculture was inoculated into 1lt lb + 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °c to an od <dig> of  <dig> . further the culture was induced by adding 1 mm iptg, and incubated for an additional  <dig> to 8 h. about 5gm of cell pellet was resuspended in 20 ml cell breaking buffer  containing a 1: <dig> dilution of the protease inhibitor mixture, suspension was pressure lysed using a french press at  <dig>  psi at 4 °c. the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm for 10 min, and further at  <dig>  rpm for 1 h. the clear supernatant was passed twice through gst beads  packed in 10 ml plastic column. protein bound beads were first thoroughly washed using the above mentioned buffer with 1 m nacl, and then with equilibration buffer . the protein was eluted from the beads after overnight incubation with prescission protease  that cleaves pcna from gst. purified proteins were estimated by both bradford’s and gel based assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis on 12 % polyacrylamide gels without or containing either  <dig>  % sds or 2–6 m urea  <cit> , and visualized by coomassie brilliant blue r- <dig> staining .

scpolη was also purified by above mentioned protocol except that gal-pgk-gst-scrad <dig> construct was expressed in yrp <dig> protease deficient yeast strain  <cit> .

glutaraldehyde cross-linking
about 20 μg of native or mutant pcna in 20 mm hepes buffer  was mixed with 1 μl of 8 % freshly prepared glutaraldehyde solution for 5 min at 37 °c. the reaction was terminated by adding equal volume of 1 m tris–hcl . cross-linked protein was solubilized with sample buffer and electrophoresis was conducted on 12 % sds-page.

size exclusion chromatography
for size exclusion chromatography, about 10 μg of purified proteins were loaded onto a superdex  <dig> pc <dig> / <dig> column pre-equilibrated with buffer containing 50 mm hepes ph <dig> , 150 mm nacl and 10 % glycerol. chromatography was performed on an aktapure m system  at a flow rate of  <dig>  ml/min at 4 °c, and the absorbance was monitored at 280 nm.

complementation analysis by plasmid curing
plasmids ycplac <dig>  or yeplac <dig>  harbouring capol <dig> or capol <dig> g178s genes, and yeplac195-scadh1p  expressing capol <dig> or capol <dig> g178s or scpol <dig> orfs were transformed into yts <dig> strain and the transformants were selected on synthetic media without tryptophan and uracil. for control experiments empty vectors were also transformed. in order to cure the resident plasmid containing mutant scpol <dig> , a transformant from each plate was grown on liquid media omitting uracil at 30 °c in shaking condition. after every 24 hrs, 100 μl of the culture was diluted with fresh 5 ml of sd w/o uracil media and allowed to grow. after seven such consecutive sub-culturing, the cultures were streaked on sd w/o uracil plates to obtain isolated colonies. about  <dig> isolated colonies were patched on both sd agar plates lacing uracil alone or tryptophan alone. further the plates were incubated at 30 °c for 2 days and number of colonies appeared on each plates were counted. the lack of growth on sd-tryptophan plate but growth on sd-uracil suggested complete curing of the resident pcna and complementation due to the incoming plasmid. on the other hand, preservation of both the nutritional markers  indicated that the tester plasmid is unable to complement for scpol <dig>  after curing, the strains were confirmed by pcr for the presence of respective plasmids.

plasmid segregation by 5-foa counter selection
yeast strain yna <dig> is a genomic null for pol <dig> but harbors yeplac195-scadh1p-scpol <dig> . an empty yeplac181-scadh1p  or containing capol <dig> or capol <dig> g178s or scpol <dig> g178s orfs were transformed into above strain. candida pcna with its own promoter in yeplac <dig> vector was also transformed. the transformants were streaked on sd media w/o leucine and uracil. isolated colonies were picked and re-streaked on sd-leucine agar plate but with or without 5′-fluoroorotic acid . after counter selection with 5′-foa, the absence of original pcna in strains surviving on foa containing plate was confirmed by pcr.

growth rates
growth rates for yeast strains were examined by inoculating the required volume of pre-culture to 100 ml fresh ypd liquid medium to get  <dig>  o.d <dig> at 0 h. about 1 ml culture was taken out in every 1 h for 18 hrs and the growth rate at 30 °c was monitored by measuring absorbance at 600 nm. growth of the strains was also monitored at 14 °c and 35 °c.

rt-pcr analysis
total rnas were isolated from various yeast stains those were used in estimating growth rates by using mp fastrna pro isolation kit  as per the manufacturer’s protocol and then samples were treated with dnaase i enzyme. equal amount of rnas were subjected to cdna synthesis using a reverse transcription core kit from eurogentec . a 50 μl pcr reaction was carried out containing 3 μl of synthesized c-dna, 200 μm dntps, 1 × taq dna polymerase buffer,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig> and 2u of taq dna polymerase  and 20pmol each of the primers nap <dig>  and nap <dig>  for the capcna; and nap <dig>  and nap <dig>  for the scpcna, respectively. primers pair nap <dig>  and nap <dig>  were used for amplification of scpolη. pcr conditions included initial heating at 95 °c for 3’ followed by 25 cycles at 95 °c for 30s, 52 °c for 45 s, 68 °c for 1’  or 1’ 45 s . pcr products were separated on 1 % agarose gel and image captured on chemi xrs gel documentation system . pcr reaction was also repeated with rna alone as template to rule out any genomic dna contamination in our preparation. intensity of each band was calculated by imagej software and relative fold change of pcna vs polη was estimated.

sensitivity to different dna damaging agents
all the pre-cultures of various strains were diluted to achieve equal number of cells in autoclaved water. further these strains were  <dig> folds serially diluted and spotted on ypd plates containing with or without different concentrations of drugs like hydroxyurea , methyl methane sulfonate , h2o <dig> and tert-butyl hydroperoxide . the plates were incubated at 30 °c for 3 days and then photographed. uridine  was added when required.

physical interaction by surface plasmon resonance
interaction of pcna with dna polymerase eta  was monitored using bio-rad xpr  <dig> surface plasmon resonance biosensor instrument. about 5 μg of capcna or scpcna or bsa  was immobilized on glc chip by amine coupling method as suggested by manufacturer’s instructions. scpolη was injected at concentration ranging from 25-500nm with running buffer composed of 25 mm hepes ph  <dig> , 10 % glycerol, 200 mm sodium acetate ph  <dig> , 8 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dtt,  <dig>  % tween- <dig> and  <dig>  mg/ml bsa, at a flow rate of 50 μl/min for 180 s with a 600 s dissociation phase. molecular interaction was carried out at 20 °c. further the dissociation constants were determined, after fitting the association and dissociation curves to a 1: <dig> -binding model.

bioinformatics analysis of candida pcna
the blast server from the ncbi was used to search for similarities between candida pcna protein and sequences deposited in the protein databank . based on the structures of homologues proteins, capcna was modelled using swiss model   <cit> , an automated protein modelling server. saccharomyces cerevisiae pcna pdb structures with id 2od <dig> and 1plr were used as template for monomeric and trimeric pcna, respectively. stereochemical quality of the model structured of capcna was further analysed by the metaserver saves. the ramachandran plot was derived by procheck and secondary structure prediction of capcna was performed with psipred v <dig>  softwares  <cit> .

"BACKGROUND
diagnosing and appropriately treating canine epilepsy requires accurate epileptic seizure detection and description of seizure semiology, the detailed observations of physical signs during a seizure episode indicative of an alteration in neurological state.
seizure semiology is a simple and cost-effective tool in the understanding of a seizure disorder and attempting to localise the epileptic focus.
as such, veterinary neurology specialists and first opinion practitioners require a detailed semiologic description of paroxysmal events to confidently diagnose canine epilepsy and categorise the type of seizures experienced.
semiologic descriptions are often obtained from the family or caregivers of human epilepsy patients, relying on common terms for ictal symptoms  <cit> ; however, video-eeg  monitoring is the preferred method for the diagnosis and classification of seizures due to its increased reliability  <cit> .
in veterinary medicine such methods are not widely available, and have doubtful reliability, and thus it is of high importance to establish the accuracy and consistency of observational reports.
these reports may come from the owners of affected dogs; however, due to the acute-onset, unpredictable and highly stressful nature of a seizure event, the reliability of these reports may be significantly reduced.
many owners now have access to mobile technology such as smart phones and tablet computers with video-recording capabilities, facilitating the recording of these events, which can later be presented to their veterinary surgeon.
this was demonstrated in a recent study of the video-sharing website youtube, where many owners uploaded videos of their dog’s seizure activity either seeking advice from viewers  or to show to their veterinarian   <cit> .
the consistency of the interpretation of these videos by different vets is therefore an area of importance.
if agreement between vets in the classification of videos of paroxysmal events is low, then vets should ensure that videos are not used in isolation of other clinical data such as signalment, history and other diagnostics to diagnose epileptic seizures.
aims
this study aimed to investigate the level of agreement between vets  on the description of videos depicting paroxysmal events without knowing the results of diagnostic workup.
as the aim was limited to evaluating the phenotype of the event only, the observers were blinded to any additional history, diagnostics or treatment outcome for all animals.
finding good agreement between observers allows judgements to be made by different observers with some confidence in their consistency, whereas finding poor agreement between observers can highlight deficiencies in classification systems, which may indicate a need for refinement of definitions, or improved training of observers.
the level of agreement between veterinary observers has important practical implications, for example, high agreement between observers is essential in multicentre clinical trials.
thus, this study aimed to highlight areas where further discussion is required, to improve consistency between neurologists diagnosing seizure disorders.
the focus of this study was on the initial perception of whether a paroxysmal event was a seizure or not, and if so, what type of seizure was present.
as seizure type is likely predicted by the semiology of the event, the level of agreement between observers over  the quality of consciousness in the patient, in addition to  the presence of  <dig> motor signs,  three autonomic signs and  three neurobehavioural signs was investigated.
as this was a novel study, the aspects of seizure semiology investigated were intentionally broad as not to exclude potentially useful characteristics, that if demonstrated to show high concordance between observers could be useful predictors of seizure type.
in addition this study sought to detect differences in the reporting of seizure semiology and classification of seizure type between specialists and non-specialists, to investigate whether there is an effect of additional training upon semiologic description.
finally, this study sought to identify which observer-perceived seizure characteristics predict reported seizure type.
if the characteristics used by observers to predict certain seizure types are not highly agreed upon then this could lead to unreliable classification of seizure type.
hypotheses
there are high levels of agreement between veterinary observers for the prediction of seizure presence and seizure type.
there are high levels of agreement between veterinary observers for the classification of  consciousness status, and the presence of  motor signs,  autonomic signs and  neurobehavioural signs.
there are differences in the classification of seizure presence and type, and reporting of seizure semiology between veterinary neurology specialists and non-specialists.
observer-reported seizure semiology will differentiate between primary generalised seizures, focal seizures, and focal seizures with secondary generalisation.
methods
a questionnaire was hosted on surveymonkey© in april  <dig>  with  <dig> senior neurology specialists  and  <dig> associate ecvn member), and  <dig> royal college of veterinary surgeon  registered non-specialist veterinary surgeons invited to participate.
one hundred videos of dogs and cats  exhibiting paroxysmal events were provided.
videos that were initially sourced from youtube© were identified using the search term “dog seizure” or “cat seizure”.
all videos on youtube are constantly shuffled by the website’s confidential search algorithms.
to randomise video selection, every 5th video was selected for analysis; however, the following exclusion criteria were applied: only one video per uploader, very poor quality videos, professional videos, advertisements, photographic collages, videos not showing domestic dogs or cats, and videos with text overlying the footage.
the resultant  <dig> youtube©-sourced videos and  <dig> author-sourced videos were provided to participants at the start of the study.
participants were requested to watch all  <dig> videos and initially answer the following questions:is what you see in the video an epileptic seizure?
if you think it is not an epileptic seizure, what term would you use to describe the episode?
participants were allowed to view the videos as often as they wished and were allowed to review the video as they were answering the survey.
if the participant responded that they believed it was not an epileptic seizure they were instructed to move on to the next video.
if participants responded that the video did indeed show an epileptic seizure, they were requested to categorise what the seizure type was best classified as .
participants were then requested to further characterise the epileptic seizure based on the presence and type of motor signs, autonomic signs and neurobehavioural signs and quality/status of consciousness, which were listed as tick boxes with the option to select as many as believed to apply .
this study was approved by the royal veterinary college ethics and welfare committee.
statistical analysis
hypothesis  <dig> and 2: are there high levels of agreement between veterinary observers for the prediction of seizure presence and type, the classification of consciousness status, and the presence of motor, autonomic and neurobehavioural signs?
agreement statistics were calculated using minitab version  <dig>  raw percentage  agreement, the percentage of the total number of observations for each variable where there is agreement was calculated for each variable across all videos, with the mean and 95% ci reported for each variable.
percentage agreement should not be solely relied upon however, as it does not take into account chance agreement, and thus to be more stringent, fleiss’ kappa  for more than  <dig> observers was calculated for each variable in the questionnaire to determine which aspects of a seizure were agreed upon between observers  <cit> .
this study compared observers equally against one another, rather than against an objective method or a trained individual and thus no ‘gold standard’ was used to compare ratings with.
good agreement was indicated by % agreements close to  <dig> and by κ values close to  <dig>  in line with benbir et al.
, concordance was rated as ‘poor’ for κ values ≤  <dig> ; ‘fair’ if κ were in the range  <dig> – <dig> ; ‘moderate’ for  <dig> – <dig> ; ‘good’ for  <dig> – <dig> ; and ‘excellent’ if κ exceeded  <dig> .
this was an exploratory study to see which aspects of a seizure were most or least agreed upon, and thus a minimum threshold of κ was not set.
as a guide, the minimum threshold for κ is often arbitrarily set at κ ≤  <dig>   <cit> .table  <dig>

a limitation of the kappa statistics is that the magnitude of κ is a function of the prevalence of the trait measured by a question as well as the number of discordant responses  <cit>  and thus a skewed distribution of data lowers the κ coefficient.
in near-homogenous populations, evidence for agreement above chance levels is difficult to identify, resulting in low κ values.
to aid the interpretation of κ values and % agreement for each variable, the prevalence index  for multiple observers  <cit>  was calculated using the following formula: pi=r1‐r2nn
pi = the absolute difference between the number of ratings in categories  <dig> and  <dig> , divided by the number of subjects  multiplied by the number of ratings per subject .
where high κ and % agreement values are achieved , pi may not need to be consulted; however, if κ is low, or if the κ and % agreement values disagree, the pi can aid in the interpretation of this result.
for example, if the % agreement is high but κ is low, this result is inconclusive due to the pi being too high, rather than due to clear inconsistency between observers.
where κ is low, but % agreement is correspondingly low, this is due to inconsistency between observers, and the variable should be considered unreliable.
such occurrences are highlighted in the results.
hypothesis 3: are there differences in the classification of seizure presence and type, and reporting of seizure semiology between veterinary neurology specialists and non-specialists?
the influence of experience and training was investigated by analysing associations between observer type  and seizure type/characteristics, using ibm spss v <dig>  the binomial dependent variable was neurology specialist or non-specialist, and the independent variables were seizure presence, type, consciousness status and the presence of motor , autonomic  and behavioural  signs.
associations were screened at the univariate level using chi-squared analysis for categorical variables.
if significant variables were identified they were taken forwards to a binary mixed model, where video number and observer were included as random effects to control for these sources of non-independence.
hypothesis 4: does observer-reported seizure semiology differentiate between primary generalised seizures, focal seizures, and focal seizures with secondary generalisation?
multinomial mixed model analyses were carried out in ibm spss v <dig> to determine which factors influenced the choice of seizure type.
three dependent variables were used in the multinomial models: primary generalised seizures, focal seizures, and focal seizures with secondary generalisation.
independent variables in the model were the observer-perceived consciousness status, and presence of thirteen motor, three autonomic and three neurobehavioural signs.
all independent factors were first tested at the univariable level using chi-squared analysis to identify significant factors for inclusion in the multinomial model, with p <  <dig>  considered for inclusion.
a backward stepwise model building strategy was used, selecting models based on fit, as determined by the akaike information criterion  statistic, significance of terms included , and maximisation of the correct percentage classification of cases.
multicollinearity was initially avoided via examining the associations between all nominal independent variables to detect any high levels of association.
if found, the variable that resulted in better model fit was selected for the final model.
all models were also checked for collinearity via inspection of the standard errors of the regression coefficients to see if they were inflated which would signify multicollinearity was a problem in that model.

to allow for statistical analysis, all videos must have been rated by an equal number of observers, and thus  <dig> of the  <dig> videos were excluded from the analysis due to missing data, and all ratings from  <dig> observer were excluded due to their low response rate to the questions.
in total  <dig> ratings were made of  <dig> videos by the remaining  <dig> independent observers.
hypothesis  <dig> and 2: are there high levels of agreement between veterinary observers for the prediction of seizure presence and type, the classification of consciousness status, and the presence of motor, autonomic and neurobehavioural signs?
epileptic seizure presence and type
when questioned on whether the paroxysmal events in the videos represented epileptic seizures, 72% of responses to all videos reported they thought the event was a seizure; however, there was a fair level of agreement  with on average only 29%  agreement between observers as to whether it was a seizure or not for each video .
overall agreement of seizure type was moderate , with on average only 18% agreement between observers across videos.
the most common seizure type reported from the videos was primary generalised , with the highest level of agreement  of all types.
the lowest level of agreement was for focal seizures .
consciousness status
very low% agreement was achieved regarding the consciousness status of the dog, with on average 9% agreement between observers as to whether the dog was conscious during the paroxysmal events .
the poorest agreement was achieved for impairment in consciousness , versus moderate levels of agreement for unconscious .
motor signs
when questioned on whether the paroxysmal events in the videos showed motor signs, 96% of responses to all videos reported they thought motor signs were present, with on average 73% agreement between observers as to whether motor signs were present .
as the pi was exceptionally high for this variable, with a homogenous sample dominated by ‘yes’ responses, the κ is artificially lowered to a level of poor agreement .
the highest levels of agreement for individual signs, as determined by κ values, were whether there were running movements, whether there were rhythmic pelvic limbs movements and whether there were rhythmic thoracic limb movements .
the lowest levels of agreement as determined by κ values were for whether the eyes were open, whether the head was turned to the side and whether movements were more present on the right side.
the latter two variables had high pis and thus the sample population may be too homogenous to interpret these results.
autonomic signs
when questioned on whether the paroxysmal events in the videos showed autonomic signs, 55% of responses to all videos reported they thought autonomic signs were present; however, % agreement was low with on average just 10% agreement between observers and a ‘fair’ κ value  .
there was good agreement as to whether the dog salivated in the video , but poor κ values for urination or defecation.
there were high pis for both urination and defecation owing to their rarity of reporting , and thus despite high % agreement , their κ values were low and thus the reliability of these signs is inconclusive.
neurobehavioural signs
when questioned on whether the paroxysmal events in the videos showed neurobehavioral signs, over half of responses reported that they were present ; however,% agreement was again very low with average agreement of just 4% across all videos and a poor κ value.
κ values for all three neurobehavioural signs were poor; however% agreement was high for aggression and hallucination and thus their κ was artificially lowered due to the homogeneity of the sample and the rarity of their reporting .
fear and anxiety was reported in nearly a fifth of ratings ; however had both a poor κ and % agreement, thus indicating low levels of agreement of its presence.
hypothesis 3: are there differences in the classification of seizure presence and type, and reporting of seizure semiology between veterinary neurology specialists and non-specialists?
chi-squared analyses revealed significant differences in seizure semiology and classification between specialists and non-specialists.
specialists were less likely to report what they saw in the videos as a seizure than non-specialists .
when questioned on what this was if not a seizure, specialists were more likely to report a movement disorder  and pain associated behaviour  than non-specialists.
specialists were less likely to report a seizure as focal , more likely to report impaired consciousness  and less likely to report unconsciousness  than non-specialists.
with regard to motor signs, specialists were less likely to report the eyes as open , oral movement , rhythmic jerks around the mouth , stiffening of the thoracic limbs , rhythmic pelvic limb movements  or that movements were equal on each side  than non-specialists.
there was no difference in the reporting of autonomic signs between specialists and non-specialists.
the only difference in the reporting of neurobehavioural signs was that specialists were more likely to report aggression than non-specialists .
there were differences in the perception of duration, with non-specialists less likely to report short episodes of only seconds  or less than 1 minute  than specialists.
when a binary mixed model analysis was attempted to determine which factors were associated with the observer being a specialist or a non-specialist, no factors were found to be significantly associated when video number and observer were included as random effects.
hypothesis 4: does observer-reported seizure semiology differentiate between primary generalised seizures, focal seizures, and focal seizures with secondary generalisation?
at the univariate level, chi-squared analysis identified several factors associated with the classification of seizure type including the presence of motor , autonomic  and neurobehavioural  signs.
multinomial mixed models identified seven factors significantly associated with reported seizure types: oral movement, stiffening of thoracic limbs, rhythmic thoracic limb movements, running movements, equal movements on each side, salivation, hallucination .table  <dig>

reports of oral movements were associated with classification as a focal seizure, with reports of their absence decreasing the likelihood of a report of a focal seizure  <dig>  fold vs. a primary generalised seizure .
reports of thoracic limb stiffening were associated with classification of primary generalised seizures, with their absence increasing the likelihood of classification as a focal seizure  <dig>  fold vs. a primary generalised seizure , and decreasing the likelihood of classification as a focal seizure with secondary generalisation  <dig>  fold vs. a focal seizure .
reports of rhythmic thoracic limb movements were also associated with classification of primary generalised seizures, with their absence increasing the likelihood of classification as a focal seizure  <dig>  fold vs. a primary generalised seizure .
reports of running movements were associated with classification as a primary generalised seizures and focal seizures with secondary generalisation, with their absence increasing the likelihood of classification as a focal seizure  <dig>  fold vs. a primary generalised seizure .
in addition, the absence of running movements decreased the likelihood of classification as a focal seizure with secondary generalisation  <dig>  fold vs. a focal seizure .
reports of equal movements on each side of the body were associated with classification as primary generalised seizures, with reports of unequal movements increasing the likelihood of classification as a focal seizure  <dig>  fold vs. a primary generalised seizure  and increasing the likelihood of classification as a focal seizure with secondary generalisation  <dig>  fold vs. primary generalised seizures .
reports of salivation were associated with the classification of primary generalised seizures, with reports of absence of salivation increasing the likelihood of classification as a focal seizure  <dig>  fold vs. a primary generalised seizure .
finally, reports of hallucination were associated with the classification of focal seizures, with reports of absence of hallucination decreasing the likelihood of classification as a focal seizure  <dig>  fold vs. a primary generalised seizure .
there was overlap in the prediction of seizure type for three aspects of seizure semiology, where their presence increased the likelihood of two seizure types.
stiffening of the thoracic limbs was associated with reports of a primary generalised seizure , but also reports of a focal seizure with secondary generalisation  .
running movements were associated with reports of a primary generalised seizure , but also reports of a focal seizure .
finally, equal movements on each side of the body were associated with reports of a primary generalised seizure .
discussion
hypothesis  <dig> and 2: are there high levels of agreement between veterinary observers for the prediction of seizure presence and type, the classification of consciousness status, and the presence of motor, autonomic and neurobehavioural signs?
prior to this study, no data were available in the literature regarding inter-observer agreement for paroxysmal event semiology between vets.
contrary to our initial hypotheses of high levels of agreement between veterinary observers for the prediction of seizure presence, type and description of seizure semiology, this study has demonstrated that there was only fair-moderate inter-observer agreement in the description of seizure semiology between a cohort of veterinary neurology specialists and non-specialists as ascertained by κ analysis and percentage agreement, with prevalence indices to aid interpretation.
no variables achieved excellent agreement, and the only variable to achieve good agreement was whether the dog salivated or not, followed by whether the seizure type was primary generalised, which nearly missed good agreement.
few of the variables showed poor agreement; however, neurobehavioural signs were the least agreed upon domain with consistently poor agreement ratings.
there was on average only 29% agreement between observers as to whether a video represented a seizure event or not, achieving a κ value of just  <dig> , a value that is commonly stated as the minimum threshold for reliability  <cit> .
this suggests that in isolation, observing videos of paroxysmal events may be an unreliable way to diagnose a seizure, thus highlighting the importance of detailed history taking, physical examination and diagnostic testing in determining whether an epileptic seizure has occurred.
similar studies have been carried out in human medicine, and parallels can be made with the results of this study  <cit> .
impairment of consciousness was the least agreed upon consciousness status category in this study, as has been demonstrated previously in a human epilepsy study  <cit> .
that study also demonstrated that head turning was less well agreed upon than other variables in humans, which in this study only showed poor agreement.
in comparison to that study, agreement between veterinarians is much lower than between human neurologists, for example concordance between two human neurologists was classed as good to excellent  for all  <dig> questions posed; however, it must be noted that in the human epilepsy study, raters were aware that the paroxysm was an epileptic seizure which may have improved agreement on aspects of semiology.
despite this, the relatively low agreement between veterinarians described by this study may justify further discussions between experts regarding semiologic descriptions, and further training to non-specialists, to improve levels of agreement.
one of the poorest areas of agreement was regarding the consciousness status of the dog, with particularly poor agreement for option ‘impairment in consciousness’.
in the authors’ collective experiences, impairment in consciousness is often interpreted and reported by the observer when dogs are standing with a blank stare and apparently being incapable of recognizing owner/surroundings, for example they do not respond to commands, but it have been argued that impairment of consciousness cannot be objectively assessed in dogs  <cit> .
assessment of consciousness during epileptic seizures is generally not a simple topic; it is individually different, not always global, and “pieces” of consciousness  can be altered  <cit> .
the oversimplification with categorization into conscious and unconscious was eliminated in the last human classification; however recognition of impairment remained an important point  <cit> .
in animals, the responsiveness by motor function is the main  of consciousness which can be evaluated.
classification of seizure type has implications for future multicentre treatment studies, as some medications used may have better effects on certain seizure types, so agreement here is of high importance.
focal seizures were the least agreed upon seizure type, which may be due to the complex array of signs that may be reported during them, including a variety of motor, postural, autonomic and behavioural signs  <cit> .
one study has shown that neurobehavioral and autonomic signs are not uncommon in dogs and indicated that motor signs are not necessarily the most dominant clinical expression of a focal seizure  <cit> .
hallucination was thought to be associated with focal seizures in this study, a sign that may be potentially difficult to confidently and reliably recognise.
hypothesis 3: are there differences in the classification of seizure presence and type, and reporting of seizure semiology between veterinary neurology specialists and non-specialists?
as hypothesised, differences were seen in the classification of seizure presence and type, and reporting of seizure semiology between veterinary neurology specialists and non-specialists.
these differences were limited to the univariate level, which may be due to the low sample size, particularly for non-specialists .
this has never been studied before and thus further study with a larger, balanced sample size of specialists and non-specialists may be warranted to confirm these results.
at the univariate level, specialists were less likely to report what they saw in the videos as an epileptic seizure than non-specialists, which may be due to their experience of other, less common paroxysmal events  that non-specialists may not recognise , or may be more experienced in recognising more subtle signs  and thus categorising the episodes as non-seizure events.
reporting of motor, autonomic and neurobehavioral signs were similar between specialists and non-specialists, with the exception of several motor variables that non-specialists were more likely to report.
it would be expected that the specialists would be more accurate than non-specialists owing to their training and experience, so it is possible that these were ‘false positives’ by the non-specialists rather than under recognition by the specialists.
specialists were more likely to report the presence of aggression than non-specialists, which may be due to the recognition of more subtle signs of aggression e.g.
changes in body posture or facial expression rather than overt signs such as snarling or growling; however, as individual signs indicating aggression were not requested it is not possible to infer the cause of this difference.
in a previous study of experienced and inexperienced people describing dog behaviour, observers showed little agreement when classifying aggression  <cit> , so it is possible that additional training in this area from behavioural experts may be useful.
hypothesis 4: does observer-reported seizure semiology differentiate between primary generalised seizures, focal seizures, and focal seizures with secondary generalisation?
only seven of the nineteen studied aspects of seizure semiology significantly differentiated between seizure type: oral movement, stiffening and rhythmic movement of the thoracic limbs, running movements, movements equally on both sides, salivation and hallucination.
with regard to the five motor signs: oral movement, stiffening of the forelimbs and equal movements on each side only achieved fair kappa values, while rhythmic thoracic limb movements achieved moderate agreement and running movements almost reached good agreement, salivation achieved a good level of agreement; however, hallucination had poor agreement.
as observers use these aspects of semiology most prominently to differentiate between seizure type, emphasis should be made to train observers to recognise these characteristics to improve agreement for those with poorer levels of achievement.
factors that did not differentiate between any of the three seizure types may be considered less useful in the categorisation of seizure type in the future; however, due to this being a novel study, further data should be gathered before these criteria are discarded.
when classifying seizure type, of the seven significant variables, those that are associated with only one seizure type may be considered most valuable, for example hallucination was only associated with focal seizures, in contrast to running movements which were associated with both primary generalised seizures and focal seizures with secondary generalisation, thus requiring further inquiry to differentiate.
statistical limitations
there were limitations to the statistics performed in this study, as in near-homogenous populations, evidence for agreement above chance levels is difficult to identify, resulting in low κ values  <cit> .
some variables in this study suffered from this problem, as reflected in very high prevalence indices , meaning that the interpretation of their corresponding κ value was limited, with low κ values but high% agreement values reflecting inconclusive statistics rather than genuinely poor agreement.
in future studies, to avoid this problem, a more balanced population should be initially selected; with approximately equal numbers of subjects in each category e.g.
50% of videos show seizures and 50% of videos show non-seizure paroxysmal episodes.
to facilitate this, a gold standard observer would be required to determine the designation of each video; for example, a specialist not participating in the study, using videos of patients that had been diagnosed with epilepsy following full work up that had evidence of response to anticonvulsive treatment.
establishing an accepted gold standard may still be challenging due to the varying beliefs of neurology specialists.
for example, some neurologists believe that spike’s disease  is a focal seizure, while others believe it is a movement disorder.
balancing the subjects in each category e.g.
for the presence of each motor, neurobehavioral and autonomic sign may not be feasible for such a large sample.
due to the presence of missing data, a direct comparison of agreement between the two sub-groups, specialists and non-specialists could not be carried out.
this was due to agreement statistics requiring an equal amount of observers to rate an equal amount of videos, resulting in videos being removed from the analyses when missing data was present for that video.
as different missing data was present, and thus different videos removed for specialists and non-specialists, this would not be a direct comparison.
the alternative approach of analysing how these groups compared in their ratings was instead carried out.
video limitations
the variable quality of the videos used in this study due to their unstandardized online source may have influenced observers’ abilities to report on the features of the episodes.
recent studies have successfully used youtube© videos to study neurological and behavioural problems in dogs  <cit> , and its capacity to facilitate large-scale studies may counterbalance this limitation.
this also reflects a real-life clinical situation where video quality is likely to vary between owners and between seizures e.g.
those that happen in poor light conditions.
a further limitation of using owner-recorded videos is that owners may not have video recording equipment to-hand when the seizure episode begins.
this is particularly problematic when observers are differentiating between primary generalised and secondary generalised seizures, as missing the beginning of a secondary generalised seizure may lead observers to erroneously classify it as a primary generalised seizure.
limitations of experience categorisation
a further limitation of this study was the designation of ‘specialist’ vs. ‘non-specialist’, which may not capture the differences in experience between the veterinarians involved.
all of the specialists had undergone extensive years of training in neurology; however, years as a specialist since this initial training was not considered, with additional years of experience potentially improving diagnostic accuracy.
some specialists may also have a clinical and/or research focus in epilepsy further increasing their experience.
in addition, although classed as ‘non-specialists’, those veterinarians involved in this study had an interest in veterinary neurology and may have seen more relevant cases, making them different from other first opinion practitioners.
as such, experience is more of a spectrum than a binomial trait.
whether the non-specialists were representative of all first opinion veterinarians or referral veterinarians of another specialism is also debatable as individual details were not requested here, and as such further study with a larger sample size may be needed to improve how representative these results are.
a further limitation related to the observers was the amount of time participating veterinarians had available to view and rate the videos may have impacted upon their responses.
information required to supplement videos of paroxysmal events
an important limitation of our study  is the lack of reliable method for the differentiation between epileptic and non-epileptic paroxysms.
the current definition of epileptic seizure is “a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain”  <cit> .
for a definitive diagnosis, the epileptic activity should be recorded, which is especially important in cases with unclear episodes.
advance in the veterinary eeg diagnostic is required.
video-eeg studies, more commonly used as a diagnostic tool in human neurology, could be used more widely in veterinary medicine to aid characterisation of episodes beyond what can be observed on a video alone.
this additional information could potentially improve inter-observer agreement.
a recent veterinary video-eeg study diagnosed a juvenile chihuahua with subtle myoclonic absences with perioral myoclonia and head twitching  <cit> .
the patient had been admitted for evaluation of what was suspected to be focal seizures, with a four-month history of recurrent episodes of head and nose twitching, associated with intermittent hind limb jerking and suspected staring for a duration of a few seconds.
the author confirmed bilateral generalized synchronous  <dig> hz spike-and-wave complexes on ictal eeg time locked with the episodes.
the case represents the first confirmed absence seizure in dog.
without video-eeg the epileptic origin could only have been speculated  <cit> .
in daily veterinary practice, some additional information is usually available that may be helpful for the assessment whether the paroxysmal event is of epileptic origin or not.
this includes breed, age of onset, pre and postictal signs, precipitating event, duration of the event, occurrence of the event during daytime, laboratory results, neuroimaging findings and response to antiepileptic therapy.
these data were not investigated  in the present study; however, it should be borne in mind that these results and the level of agreement could have been influenced by their inclusion.
further study
further exploration of this area could include an inter-observer agreement study of seizure-episode videos between owners and neurologists to investigate the accuracy of reports they are provided with.
in a study of human epilepsy  <cit> , high concordance between physicians and caregivers was observed.
this was not anticipated by the authors; with differences in training and experience expected to lead to reduced concordance.
the authors speculated that because of long disease duration and high seizure frequency in the majority of patients, most caregivers are likely to have experienced several seizure episodes first-hand, and thus their increased familiarity with the condition would increase the similarity of their ratings with physicians.
this could be investigated in veterinary patients, with owners with differing levels of experience of canine epilepsy  and between owners of dogs experiencing different seizure phenotypes .
if good concordance is seen between vets and owners, then greater confidence may be given to owner descriptions for those cases where videos are not provided.
CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study has demonstrated that there were relatively low levels of agreement of seizure presence, type and semiologies reported by veterinary neurology specialists and non-specialists, highlighting the need for ongoing debate regarding the descriptive terminology used for seizure semiology in veterinary medicine, and the need for further training in focussed areas.
although the use of videos to diagnose seizure activity may be increasingly common, the results presented here demonstrate that it should not be solely relied upon, with existing diagnostics always supplementing videos, and new diagnostics such as eeg more widely used for more objective, definitive diagnoses.

",772,"BACKGROUND
diagnosing and appropriately treating canine epilepsy requires accurate epileptic seizure detection and description of seizure semiology, the detailed observations of physical signs during a seizure episode indicative of an alteration in neurological state. seizure semiology is a simple and cost-effective tool in the understanding of a seizure disorder and attempting to localise the epileptic focus. as such, veterinary neurology specialists and first opinion practitioners require a detailed semiologic description of paroxysmal events to confidently diagnose canine epilepsy and categorise the type of seizures experienced. semiologic descriptions are often obtained from the family or caregivers of human epilepsy patients, relying on common terms for ictal symptoms  <cit> ; however, video-eeg  monitoring is the preferred method for the diagnosis and classification of seizures due to its increased reliability  <cit> . in veterinary medicine such methods are not widely available, and have doubtful reliability, and thus it is of high importance to establish the accuracy and consistency of observational reports. these reports may come from the owners of affected dogs; however, due to the acute-onset, unpredictable and highly stressful nature of a seizure event, the reliability of these reports may be significantly reduced. many owners now have access to mobile technology such as smart phones and tablet computers with video-recording capabilities, facilitating the recording of these events, which can later be presented to their veterinary surgeon. this was demonstrated in a recent study of the video-sharing website youtube, where many owners uploaded videos of their dog’s seizure activity either seeking advice from viewers  or to show to their veterinarian   <cit> . the consistency of the interpretation of these videos by different vets is therefore an area of importance. if agreement between vets in the classification of videos of paroxysmal events is low, then vets should ensure that videos are not used in isolation of other clinical data such as signalment, history and other diagnostics to diagnose epileptic seizures.

aims
this study aimed to investigate the level of agreement between vets  on the description of videos depicting paroxysmal events without knowing the results of diagnostic workup. as the aim was limited to evaluating the phenotype of the event only, the observers were blinded to any additional history, diagnostics or treatment outcome for all animals. finding good agreement between observers allows judgements to be made by different observers with some confidence in their consistency, whereas finding poor agreement between observers can highlight deficiencies in classification systems, which may indicate a need for refinement of definitions, or improved training of observers. the level of agreement between veterinary observers has important practical implications, for example, high agreement between observers is essential in multicentre clinical trials. thus, this study aimed to highlight areas where further discussion is required, to improve consistency between neurologists diagnosing seizure disorders.

the focus of this study was on the initial perception of whether a paroxysmal event was a seizure or not, and if so, what type of seizure was present. as seizure type is likely predicted by the semiology of the event, the level of agreement between observers over  the quality of consciousness in the patient, in addition to  the presence of  <dig> motor signs,  three autonomic signs and  three neurobehavioural signs was investigated. as this was a novel study, the aspects of seizure semiology investigated were intentionally broad as not to exclude potentially useful characteristics, that if demonstrated to show high concordance between observers could be useful predictors of seizure type.

in addition this study sought to detect differences in the reporting of seizure semiology and classification of seizure type between specialists and non-specialists, to investigate whether there is an effect of additional training upon semiologic description. finally, this study sought to identify which observer-perceived seizure characteristics predict reported seizure type. if the characteristics used by observers to predict certain seizure types are not highly agreed upon then this could lead to unreliable classification of seizure type.

hypotheses
there are high levels of agreement between veterinary observers for the prediction of seizure presence and seizure type.

there are high levels of agreement between veterinary observers for the classification of  consciousness status, and the presence of  motor signs,  autonomic signs and  neurobehavioural signs.

there are differences in the classification of seizure presence and type, and reporting of seizure semiology between veterinary neurology specialists and non-specialists.

observer-reported seizure semiology will differentiate between primary generalised seizures, focal seizures, and focal seizures with secondary generalisation.



methods
a questionnaire was hosted on surveymonkey© in april  <dig>  with  <dig> senior neurology specialists  and  <dig> associate ecvn member), and  <dig> royal college of veterinary surgeon  registered non-specialist veterinary surgeons invited to participate. one hundred videos of dogs and cats  exhibiting paroxysmal events were provided. videos that were initially sourced from youtube© were identified using the search term “dog seizure” or “cat seizure”. all videos on youtube are constantly shuffled by the website’s confidential search algorithms. to randomise video selection, every 5th video was selected for analysis; however, the following exclusion criteria were applied: only one video per uploader, very poor quality videos, professional videos, advertisements, photographic collages, videos not showing domestic dogs or cats, and videos with text overlying the footage. the resultant  <dig> youtube©-sourced videos and  <dig> author-sourced videos were provided to participants at the start of the study.

participants were requested to watch all  <dig> videos and initially answer the following questions:is what you see in the video an epileptic seizure?

if you think it is not an epileptic seizure, what term would you use to describe the episode?



participants were allowed to view the videos as often as they wished and were allowed to review the video as they were answering the survey. if the participant responded that they believed it was not an epileptic seizure they were instructed to move on to the next video. if participants responded that the video did indeed show an epileptic seizure, they were requested to categorise what the seizure type was best classified as . participants were then requested to further characterise the epileptic seizure based on the presence and type of motor signs, autonomic signs and neurobehavioural signs and quality/status of consciousness, which were listed as tick boxes with the option to select as many as believed to apply . this study was approved by the royal veterinary college ethics and welfare committee.

statistical analysis
hypothesis  <dig> and 2: are there high levels of agreement between veterinary observers for the prediction of seizure presence and type, the classification of consciousness status, and the presence of motor, autonomic and neurobehavioural signs?
agreement statistics were calculated using minitab version  <dig>  raw percentage  agreement, the percentage of the total number of observations for each variable where there is agreement was calculated for each variable across all videos, with the mean and 95% ci reported for each variable. percentage agreement should not be solely relied upon however, as it does not take into account chance agreement, and thus to be more stringent, fleiss’ kappa  for more than  <dig> observers was calculated for each variable in the questionnaire to determine which aspects of a seizure were agreed upon between observers  <cit> .

this study compared observers equally against one another, rather than against an objective method or a trained individual and thus no ‘gold standard’ was used to compare ratings with. good agreement was indicated by % agreements close to  <dig> and by κ values close to  <dig>  in line with benbir et al. , concordance was rated as ‘poor’ for κ values ≤  <dig> ; ‘fair’ if κ were in the range  <dig> – <dig> ; ‘moderate’ for  <dig> – <dig> ; ‘good’ for  <dig> – <dig> ; and ‘excellent’ if κ exceeded  <dig> . this was an exploratory study to see which aspects of a seizure were most or least agreed upon, and thus a minimum threshold of κ was not set. as a guide, the minimum threshold for κ is often arbitrarily set at κ ≤  <dig>   <cit> .table  <dig>

a limitation of the kappa statistics is that the magnitude of κ is a function of the prevalence of the trait measured by a question as well as the number of discordant responses  <cit>  and thus a skewed distribution of data lowers the κ coefficient. in near-homogenous populations, evidence for agreement above chance levels is difficult to identify, resulting in low κ values. to aid the interpretation of κ values and % agreement for each variable, the prevalence index  for multiple observers  <cit>  was calculated using the following formula: pi=r1‐r2nn 

pi = the absolute difference between the number of ratings in categories  <dig> and  <dig> , divided by the number of subjects  multiplied by the number of ratings per subject .

where high κ and % agreement values are achieved , pi may not need to be consulted; however, if κ is low, or if the κ and % agreement values disagree, the pi can aid in the interpretation of this result. for example, if the % agreement is high but κ is low, this result is inconclusive due to the pi being too high, rather than due to clear inconsistency between observers. where κ is low, but % agreement is correspondingly low, this is due to inconsistency between observers, and the variable should be considered unreliable. such occurrences are highlighted in the results.

hypothesis 3: are there differences in the classification of seizure presence and type, and reporting of seizure semiology between veterinary neurology specialists and non-specialists?
the influence of experience and training was investigated by analysing associations between observer type  and seizure type/characteristics, using ibm spss v <dig>  the binomial dependent variable was neurology specialist or non-specialist, and the independent variables were seizure presence, type, consciousness status and the presence of motor , autonomic  and behavioural  signs. associations were screened at the univariate level using chi-squared analysis for categorical variables. if significant variables were identified they were taken forwards to a binary mixed model, where video number and observer were included as random effects to control for these sources of non-independence.

hypothesis 4: does observer-reported seizure semiology differentiate between primary generalised seizures, focal seizures, and focal seizures with secondary generalisation?
multinomial mixed model analyses were carried out in ibm spss v <dig> to determine which factors influenced the choice of seizure type. three dependent variables were used in the multinomial models: primary generalised seizures, focal seizures, and focal seizures with secondary generalisation. independent variables in the model were the observer-perceived consciousness status, and presence of thirteen motor, three autonomic and three neurobehavioural signs. all independent factors were first tested at the univariable level using chi-squared analysis to identify significant factors for inclusion in the multinomial model, with p <  <dig>  considered for inclusion. a backward stepwise model building strategy was used, selecting models based on fit, as determined by the akaike information criterion  statistic, significance of terms included , and maximisation of the correct percentage classification of cases. multicollinearity was initially avoided via examining the associations between all nominal independent variables to detect any high levels of association. if found, the variable that resulted in better model fit was selected for the final model. all models were also checked for collinearity via inspection of the standard errors of the regression coefficients to see if they were inflated which would signify multicollinearity was a problem in that model.

RESULTS
to allow for statistical analysis, all videos must have been rated by an equal number of observers, and thus  <dig> of the  <dig> videos were excluded from the analysis due to missing data, and all ratings from  <dig> observer were excluded due to their low response rate to the questions. in total  <dig> ratings were made of  <dig> videos by the remaining  <dig> independent observers.

when questioned on whether the paroxysmal events in the videos represented epileptic seizures, 72% of responses to all videos reported they thought the event was a seizure; however, there was a fair level of agreement  with on average only 29%  agreement between observers as to whether it was a seizure or not for each video . overall agreement of seizure type was moderate , with on average only 18% agreement between observers across videos. the most common seizure type reported from the videos was primary generalised , with the highest level of agreement  of all types. the lowest level of agreement was for focal seizures .

consciousness status
very low% agreement was achieved regarding the consciousness status of the dog, with on average 9% agreement between observers as to whether the dog was conscious during the paroxysmal events . the poorest agreement was achieved for impairment in consciousness , versus moderate levels of agreement for unconscious .

motor signs
when questioned on whether the paroxysmal events in the videos showed motor signs, 96% of responses to all videos reported they thought motor signs were present, with on average 73% agreement between observers as to whether motor signs were present . as the pi was exceptionally high for this variable, with a homogenous sample dominated by ‘yes’ responses, the κ is artificially lowered to a level of poor agreement . the highest levels of agreement for individual signs, as determined by κ values, were whether there were running movements, whether there were rhythmic pelvic limbs movements and whether there were rhythmic thoracic limb movements . the lowest levels of agreement as determined by κ values were for whether the eyes were open, whether the head was turned to the side and whether movements were more present on the right side. the latter two variables had high pis and thus the sample population may be too homogenous to interpret these results.

autonomic signs
when questioned on whether the paroxysmal events in the videos showed autonomic signs, 55% of responses to all videos reported they thought autonomic signs were present; however, % agreement was low with on average just 10% agreement between observers and a ‘fair’ κ value  . there was good agreement as to whether the dog salivated in the video , but poor κ values for urination or defecation. there were high pis for both urination and defecation owing to their rarity of reporting , and thus despite high % agreement , their κ values were low and thus the reliability of these signs is inconclusive.

neurobehavioural signs
when questioned on whether the paroxysmal events in the videos showed neurobehavioral signs, over half of responses reported that they were present ; however,% agreement was again very low with average agreement of just 4% across all videos and a poor κ value. κ values for all three neurobehavioural signs were poor; however% agreement was high for aggression and hallucination and thus their κ was artificially lowered due to the homogeneity of the sample and the rarity of their reporting . fear and anxiety was reported in nearly a fifth of ratings ; however had both a poor κ and % agreement, thus indicating low levels of agreement of its presence.

hypothesis 3: are there differences in the classification of seizure presence and type, and reporting of seizure semiology between veterinary neurology specialists and non-specialists?
chi-squared analyses revealed significant differences in seizure semiology and classification between specialists and non-specialists. specialists were less likely to report what they saw in the videos as a seizure than non-specialists . when questioned on what this was if not a seizure, specialists were more likely to report a movement disorder  and pain associated behaviour  than non-specialists. specialists were less likely to report a seizure as focal , more likely to report impaired consciousness  and less likely to report unconsciousness  than non-specialists. with regard to motor signs, specialists were less likely to report the eyes as open , oral movement , rhythmic jerks around the mouth , stiffening of the thoracic limbs , rhythmic pelvic limb movements  or that movements were equal on each side  than non-specialists. there was no difference in the reporting of autonomic signs between specialists and non-specialists. the only difference in the reporting of neurobehavioural signs was that specialists were more likely to report aggression than non-specialists . there were differences in the perception of duration, with non-specialists less likely to report short episodes of only seconds  or less than 1 minute  than specialists. when a binary mixed model analysis was attempted to determine which factors were associated with the observer being a specialist or a non-specialist, no factors were found to be significantly associated when video number and observer were included as random effects.

hypothesis 4: does observer-reported seizure semiology differentiate between primary generalised seizures, focal seizures, and focal seizures with secondary generalisation?
at the univariate level, chi-squared analysis identified several factors associated with the classification of seizure type including the presence of motor , autonomic  and neurobehavioural  signs. multinomial mixed models identified seven factors significantly associated with reported seizure types: oral movement, stiffening of thoracic limbs, rhythmic thoracic limb movements, running movements, equal movements on each side, salivation, hallucination .table  <dig>

reports of oral movements were associated with classification as a focal seizure, with reports of their absence decreasing the likelihood of a report of a focal seizure  <dig>  fold vs. a primary generalised seizure . reports of thoracic limb stiffening were associated with classification of primary generalised seizures, with their absence increasing the likelihood of classification as a focal seizure  <dig>  fold vs. a primary generalised seizure , and decreasing the likelihood of classification as a focal seizure with secondary generalisation  <dig>  fold vs. a focal seizure . reports of rhythmic thoracic limb movements were also associated with classification of primary generalised seizures, with their absence increasing the likelihood of classification as a focal seizure  <dig>  fold vs. a primary generalised seizure . reports of running movements were associated with classification as a primary generalised seizures and focal seizures with secondary generalisation, with their absence increasing the likelihood of classification as a focal seizure  <dig>  fold vs. a primary generalised seizure . in addition, the absence of running movements decreased the likelihood of classification as a focal seizure with secondary generalisation  <dig>  fold vs. a focal seizure . reports of equal movements on each side of the body were associated with classification as primary generalised seizures, with reports of unequal movements increasing the likelihood of classification as a focal seizure  <dig>  fold vs. a primary generalised seizure  and increasing the likelihood of classification as a focal seizure with secondary generalisation  <dig>  fold vs. primary generalised seizures .

reports of salivation were associated with the classification of primary generalised seizures, with reports of absence of salivation increasing the likelihood of classification as a focal seizure  <dig>  fold vs. a primary generalised seizure . finally, reports of hallucination were associated with the classification of focal seizures, with reports of absence of hallucination decreasing the likelihood of classification as a focal seizure  <dig>  fold vs. a primary generalised seizure .

there was overlap in the prediction of seizure type for three aspects of seizure semiology, where their presence increased the likelihood of two seizure types. stiffening of the thoracic limbs was associated with reports of a primary generalised seizure , but also reports of a focal seizure with secondary generalisation  . running movements were associated with reports of a primary generalised seizure , but also reports of a focal seizure . finally, equal movements on each side of the body were associated with reports of a primary generalised seizure .

discussion
hypothesis  <dig> and 2: are there high levels of agreement between veterinary observers for the prediction of seizure presence and type, the classification of consciousness status, and the presence of motor, autonomic and neurobehavioural signs?
prior to this study, no data were available in the literature regarding inter-observer agreement for paroxysmal event semiology between vets. contrary to our initial hypotheses of high levels of agreement between veterinary observers for the prediction of seizure presence, type and description of seizure semiology, this study has demonstrated that there was only fair-moderate inter-observer agreement in the description of seizure semiology between a cohort of veterinary neurology specialists and non-specialists as ascertained by κ analysis and percentage agreement, with prevalence indices to aid interpretation. no variables achieved excellent agreement, and the only variable to achieve good agreement was whether the dog salivated or not, followed by whether the seizure type was primary generalised, which nearly missed good agreement. few of the variables showed poor agreement; however, neurobehavioural signs were the least agreed upon domain with consistently poor agreement ratings. there was on average only 29% agreement between observers as to whether a video represented a seizure event or not, achieving a κ value of just  <dig> , a value that is commonly stated as the minimum threshold for reliability  <cit> . this suggests that in isolation, observing videos of paroxysmal events may be an unreliable way to diagnose a seizure, thus highlighting the importance of detailed history taking, physical examination and diagnostic testing in determining whether an epileptic seizure has occurred.

similar studies have been carried out in human medicine, and parallels can be made with the results of this study  <cit> . impairment of consciousness was the least agreed upon consciousness status category in this study, as has been demonstrated previously in a human epilepsy study  <cit> . that study also demonstrated that head turning was less well agreed upon than other variables in humans, which in this study only showed poor agreement. in comparison to that study, agreement between veterinarians is much lower than between human neurologists, for example concordance between two human neurologists was classed as good to excellent  for all  <dig> questions posed; however, it must be noted that in the human epilepsy study, raters were aware that the paroxysm was an epileptic seizure which may have improved agreement on aspects of semiology. despite this, the relatively low agreement between veterinarians described by this study may justify further discussions between experts regarding semiologic descriptions, and further training to non-specialists, to improve levels of agreement.

one of the poorest areas of agreement was regarding the consciousness status of the dog, with particularly poor agreement for option ‘impairment in consciousness’. in the authors’ collective experiences, impairment in consciousness is often interpreted and reported by the observer when dogs are standing with a blank stare and apparently being incapable of recognizing owner/surroundings, for example they do not respond to commands, but it have been argued that impairment of consciousness cannot be objectively assessed in dogs  <cit> . assessment of consciousness during epileptic seizures is generally not a simple topic; it is individually different, not always global, and “pieces” of consciousness  can be altered  <cit> . the oversimplification with categorization into conscious and unconscious was eliminated in the last human classification; however recognition of impairment remained an important point  <cit> . in animals, the responsiveness by motor function is the main  of consciousness which can be evaluated.

classification of seizure type has implications for future multicentre treatment studies, as some medications used may have better effects on certain seizure types, so agreement here is of high importance. focal seizures were the least agreed upon seizure type, which may be due to the complex array of signs that may be reported during them, including a variety of motor, postural, autonomic and behavioural signs  <cit> . one study has shown that neurobehavioral and autonomic signs are not uncommon in dogs and indicated that motor signs are not necessarily the most dominant clinical expression of a focal seizure  <cit> . hallucination was thought to be associated with focal seizures in this study, a sign that may be potentially difficult to confidently and reliably recognise.

hypothesis 3: are there differences in the classification of seizure presence and type, and reporting of seizure semiology between veterinary neurology specialists and non-specialists?
as hypothesised, differences were seen in the classification of seizure presence and type, and reporting of seizure semiology between veterinary neurology specialists and non-specialists. these differences were limited to the univariate level, which may be due to the low sample size, particularly for non-specialists . this has never been studied before and thus further study with a larger, balanced sample size of specialists and non-specialists may be warranted to confirm these results. at the univariate level, specialists were less likely to report what they saw in the videos as an epileptic seizure than non-specialists, which may be due to their experience of other, less common paroxysmal events  that non-specialists may not recognise , or may be more experienced in recognising more subtle signs  and thus categorising the episodes as non-seizure events. reporting of motor, autonomic and neurobehavioral signs were similar between specialists and non-specialists, with the exception of several motor variables that non-specialists were more likely to report. it would be expected that the specialists would be more accurate than non-specialists owing to their training and experience, so it is possible that these were ‘false positives’ by the non-specialists rather than under recognition by the specialists. specialists were more likely to report the presence of aggression than non-specialists, which may be due to the recognition of more subtle signs of aggression e.g. changes in body posture or facial expression rather than overt signs such as snarling or growling; however, as individual signs indicating aggression were not requested it is not possible to infer the cause of this difference. in a previous study of experienced and inexperienced people describing dog behaviour, observers showed little agreement when classifying aggression  <cit> , so it is possible that additional training in this area from behavioural experts may be useful.

hypothesis 4: does observer-reported seizure semiology differentiate between primary generalised seizures, focal seizures, and focal seizures with secondary generalisation?
only seven of the nineteen studied aspects of seizure semiology significantly differentiated between seizure type: oral movement, stiffening and rhythmic movement of the thoracic limbs, running movements, movements equally on both sides, salivation and hallucination. with regard to the five motor signs: oral movement, stiffening of the forelimbs and equal movements on each side only achieved fair kappa values, while rhythmic thoracic limb movements achieved moderate agreement and running movements almost reached good agreement, salivation achieved a good level of agreement; however, hallucination had poor agreement. as observers use these aspects of semiology most prominently to differentiate between seizure type, emphasis should be made to train observers to recognise these characteristics to improve agreement for those with poorer levels of achievement. factors that did not differentiate between any of the three seizure types may be considered less useful in the categorisation of seizure type in the future; however, due to this being a novel study, further data should be gathered before these criteria are discarded. when classifying seizure type, of the seven significant variables, those that are associated with only one seizure type may be considered most valuable, for example hallucination was only associated with focal seizures, in contrast to running movements which were associated with both primary generalised seizures and focal seizures with secondary generalisation, thus requiring further inquiry to differentiate.

statistical limitations
there were limitations to the statistics performed in this study, as in near-homogenous populations, evidence for agreement above chance levels is difficult to identify, resulting in low κ values  <cit> . some variables in this study suffered from this problem, as reflected in very high prevalence indices , meaning that the interpretation of their corresponding κ value was limited, with low κ values but high% agreement values reflecting inconclusive statistics rather than genuinely poor agreement. in future studies, to avoid this problem, a more balanced population should be initially selected; with approximately equal numbers of subjects in each category e.g. 50% of videos show seizures and 50% of videos show non-seizure paroxysmal episodes. to facilitate this, a gold standard observer would be required to determine the designation of each video; for example, a specialist not participating in the study, using videos of patients that had been diagnosed with epilepsy following full work up that had evidence of response to anticonvulsive treatment. establishing an accepted gold standard may still be challenging due to the varying beliefs of neurology specialists. for example, some neurologists believe that spike’s disease  is a focal seizure, while others believe it is a movement disorder. balancing the subjects in each category e.g. for the presence of each motor, neurobehavioral and autonomic sign may not be feasible for such a large sample.

due to the presence of missing data, a direct comparison of agreement between the two sub-groups, specialists and non-specialists could not be carried out. this was due to agreement statistics requiring an equal amount of observers to rate an equal amount of videos, resulting in videos being removed from the analyses when missing data was present for that video. as different missing data was present, and thus different videos removed for specialists and non-specialists, this would not be a direct comparison. the alternative approach of analysing how these groups compared in their ratings was instead carried out.

video limitations
the variable quality of the videos used in this study due to their unstandardized online source may have influenced observers’ abilities to report on the features of the episodes. recent studies have successfully used youtube© videos to study neurological and behavioural problems in dogs  <cit> , and its capacity to facilitate large-scale studies may counterbalance this limitation. this also reflects a real-life clinical situation where video quality is likely to vary between owners and between seizures e.g. those that happen in poor light conditions. a further limitation of using owner-recorded videos is that owners may not have video recording equipment to-hand when the seizure episode begins. this is particularly problematic when observers are differentiating between primary generalised and secondary generalised seizures, as missing the beginning of a secondary generalised seizure may lead observers to erroneously classify it as a primary generalised seizure.

limitations of experience categorisation
a further limitation of this study was the designation of ‘specialist’ vs. ‘non-specialist’, which may not capture the differences in experience between the veterinarians involved. all of the specialists had undergone extensive years of training in neurology; however, years as a specialist since this initial training was not considered, with additional years of experience potentially improving diagnostic accuracy. some specialists may also have a clinical and/or research focus in epilepsy further increasing their experience. in addition, although classed as ‘non-specialists’, those veterinarians involved in this study had an interest in veterinary neurology and may have seen more relevant cases, making them different from other first opinion practitioners. as such, experience is more of a spectrum than a binomial trait. whether the non-specialists were representative of all first opinion veterinarians or referral veterinarians of another specialism is also debatable as individual details were not requested here, and as such further study with a larger sample size may be needed to improve how representative these results are. a further limitation related to the observers was the amount of time participating veterinarians had available to view and rate the videos may have impacted upon their responses.

information required to supplement videos of paroxysmal events
an important limitation of our study  is the lack of reliable method for the differentiation between epileptic and non-epileptic paroxysms. the current definition of epileptic seizure is “a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain”  <cit> . for a definitive diagnosis, the epileptic activity should be recorded, which is especially important in cases with unclear episodes. advance in the veterinary eeg diagnostic is required. video-eeg studies, more commonly used as a diagnostic tool in human neurology, could be used more widely in veterinary medicine to aid characterisation of episodes beyond what can be observed on a video alone. this additional information could potentially improve inter-observer agreement. a recent veterinary video-eeg study diagnosed a juvenile chihuahua with subtle myoclonic absences with perioral myoclonia and head twitching  <cit> . the patient had been admitted for evaluation of what was suspected to be focal seizures, with a four-month history of recurrent episodes of head and nose twitching, associated with intermittent hind limb jerking and suspected staring for a duration of a few seconds. the author confirmed bilateral generalized synchronous  <dig> hz spike-and-wave complexes on ictal eeg time locked with the episodes. the case represents the first confirmed absence seizure in dog. without video-eeg the epileptic origin could only have been speculated  <cit> .

in daily veterinary practice, some additional information is usually available that may be helpful for the assessment whether the paroxysmal event is of epileptic origin or not. this includes breed, age of onset, pre and postictal signs, precipitating event, duration of the event, occurrence of the event during daytime, laboratory results, neuroimaging findings and response to antiepileptic therapy. these data were not investigated  in the present study; however, it should be borne in mind that these results and the level of agreement could have been influenced by their inclusion.

further study
further exploration of this area could include an inter-observer agreement study of seizure-episode videos between owners and neurologists to investigate the accuracy of reports they are provided with. in a study of human epilepsy  <cit> , high concordance between physicians and caregivers was observed. this was not anticipated by the authors; with differences in training and experience expected to lead to reduced concordance. the authors speculated that because of long disease duration and high seizure frequency in the majority of patients, most caregivers are likely to have experienced several seizure episodes first-hand, and thus their increased familiarity with the condition would increase the similarity of their ratings with physicians. this could be investigated in veterinary patients, with owners with differing levels of experience of canine epilepsy  and between owners of dogs experiencing different seizure phenotypes . if good concordance is seen between vets and owners, then greater confidence may be given to owner descriptions for those cases where videos are not provided.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study has demonstrated that there were relatively low levels of agreement of seizure presence, type and semiologies reported by veterinary neurology specialists and non-specialists, highlighting the need for ongoing debate regarding the descriptive terminology used for seizure semiology in veterinary medicine, and the need for further training in focussed areas. although the use of videos to diagnose seizure activity may be increasingly common, the results presented here demonstrate that it should not be solely relied upon, with existing diagnostics always supplementing videos, and new diagnostics such as eeg more widely used for more objective, definitive diagnoses.

"BACKGROUND
type  <dig> diabetes and cushing's syndrome have similar phenotypes, including visceral obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance  <cit> .
in the case of cushing's syndrome, the patients have elevated circulating glucocorticoids whereas patients with type  <dig> diabetes have normal circulating levels but higher intracellular levels  <cit> .
the concentration of active glucocorticoids  formed at the cellular level is regulated by the degree of reductase activity of the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  type  <dig> enzyme  <cit> .
glucocorticoids have been shown to decrease the levels of adiponectin in animal models  <cit>  and in humans  <cit> .
adiponectin is a hormone secreted exclusively from adipose tissue  <cit> , the concentrations of which are positively correlated with a favorable metabolic phenotype in humans  <cit> .
it circulates in serum as a basic trimer, a hexamer, and larger multimeric structures  <cit> .
the full-length protein influences hepatic gluconeogenesis whilst the globular domain of adiponectin stimulates β-oxidation in muscle.
these effects are mediated by the adipor <dig>  and adipor <dig>  receptors respectively  <cit> .
recently it was shown that the appl <dig> adaptor protein binds to the intracellular domain of adiponectin receptors and confers some of adiponectin's actions  <cit> , and thus may be an important mediator of adiponectin-dependent insulin sensitization in skeletal muscle.
the mrna expression of adiponectin is reduced in adipose tissue in obese mice and humans  <cit>  although the picture differs somewhat depending on fat depot.
adiponectin is not only decreased in obese individuals but also in type  <dig> diabetic patients  <cit>  and a low level is a risk factor for developing this disease  <cit> .
physiological doses of adiponectin improve insulin sensitivity in db/db and kkay mice, two mouse models of type  <dig> diabetes, partly by decreasing triglycerides  in liver and muscle tissue  <cit> .
treatment with thiazolidinediones increases the expression and secretion of adiponectin in both rodents and humans  <cit> , indicating that changes in this adipokine may be integral to the therapeutic effects of thiazolidinediones  <cit> .
transgenic mice overexpressing 11β hsd1-selectively in adipose tissue develop type  <dig> diabetes and visceral obesity  <cit> , in contrast to the 11β hsd <dig> knockout mouse, which displays a favorable phenotype with normoglycemia and normal weight  <cit> .
this animal resists diet-induced obesity, has improved glucose and insulin tolerance and demonstrates favorable changes in cytokine expression, including a doubling in adiponectin.
another transgenic mouse overexpressing hsd type  <dig> in adipose tissue, and thereby inhibiting corticosterone exposure intracellularly, also had higher expression of adiponectin than its wild type counterparts when fed a high fat diet  <cit> .
various inhibitors of 11β hsd <dig> have been disclosed, with multiple favourable effects on the metabolic phenotype.
in addition to increased insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance  <cit> , anti-obesity effects such as reduced food intake, body weight gain and reduced percentage body fat have been reported  <cit> .
furthermore, atherosclerotic plaque lesions in apoe knockout mice were improved after treatment with 11β hsd <dig> inhibitors  <cit> .
however, despite favourable effects on the insulin-sensitising adipokine adiponectin in genetic models of 11β hsd <dig> inhibition and corticosterone reduction, no such analysis has been reported in pharmacological models.
substance bvt <dig> inhibited11β hsd <dig> in adipose tissue.
it has good bioavailability  and low clearance, resulting in high cmax values  <cit> .
when tested in c57bl <dig> mice, the compound displayed excellent pharmacodynamics in adipose tissue, inhibiting 11β hsd <dig> activity by 90%,  <dig> and  <dig> hours after dosing   <cit> .
the aim of this study was to investigate if inhibition of 11β hsd <dig> in adipocytes with the specific inhibitor bvt <dig> affects the concentrations of adiponectin with concomitant impact on glucose homeostasis in diabetic mice.
we compared the effects with bvt <dig>  <cit> , another 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor shown to exert its effects through alteration of glucose handling in the liver.
RESULTS
potency and pharmacodynamic activity of 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor bvt116429
bvt <dig> -2--1-ethylamino)-5-methyl-5-thiazol-4-one  is a potent reversible competitive inhibitor of human and mouse 11β hsd <dig> with >  <dig> fold selectivity over human 11β hsd <dig>  inhibitory constants derived from in vitro inhibition assays using purified recombinant mouse and human 11β hsd <dig> were  <dig> and  <dig> nm, respectively .
representative data for human the enzyme is shown in figure  <dig>  bvt <dig> had no significant effect on a panel of  <dig> unrelated proteins and ion channels .
to determine the effect of bvt <dig> in cells, human primary adipose cells were treated with increasing concentrations of compound and the ability of the cells to convert cortisone to cortisol was assessed using a cortisol elisa assay.
repeated assays showed that bvt <dig> inhibited intracellular 11β hsd <dig> with an ic <dig> of  <dig> nm .
to understand the degree of 11β hsd <dig> inhibition in liver from mice dosed with bvt <dig> at  <dig> mg/kg, the liver was excised  <dig> h post last dose, minced and exposed to cortisone ex vivo for  <dig> minutes.
data showed that the compound inhibits conversion of cortisone to cortisol by 11β hsd <dig> in liver such that two hours post-dosing, liver 11β hsd <dig> activity was reduced by 35% .
this contrast with the compounds greater effects in adipose tissue   <cit> .
thus, bvt <dig> displays significant inhibitory activity against the enzyme in key target organs after oral dosing in c57/bl6j mice with especially high activity in adipose tissue.
effect of bvt <dig> treatment on plasma glucose
to test the effects of bvt <dig> on the diabetic phenotype of kkay mice, male mice were treated with compound for  <dig> days as described in the methods section.
fasting glucose was reduced in animals treated with  <dig> mg/kg bvt <dig>  an effect that was comparable to that of rosiglitazone .
effect of bvt <dig> treatment on adiponectin in vivo and in vitro
different transgenic mouse models with altered 11β hsd <dig> activity or glucocorticoid concentrations demonstrate elevated adiponectin concentrations.
for this reason, and considering the apparently greater effects of bvt <dig> on 11β hsd <dig> activity in adipose tissue, we measured adiponectin in kkay mice treated with bvt <dig>  total adiponectin levels were elevated in kkay mice after treatment with both bvt <dig>  and rosiglitazone compared with control .
in view of recent findings that the distribution of different adiponectin complexes is critical in determining insulin sensitivity  <cit> , we decided to investigate the complex composition of adiponectin in serum from the kkay mice.
the most prominent adiponectin complex in kkay mice was the hexamer .
both the hexameric and the high molecular weight  multimeric forms were increased after treatment with bvt <dig>  and rosiglitazone .
in order to understand the mechanistic interplay between 11β hsd <dig> inhibition and a concomitant increase of adiponectin levels better, we studied human primary adipocytes in culture.
terminally differentiated human adipocytes were treated with bvt <dig> for  <dig> hours in the presence of cortisone.
adiponectin concentrations released into the culture medium increased by  <dig> -fold, from  <dig>  ng/ml in the absence of compound to  <dig>  ng/ml in its presence .
thus, inhibition of 11β hsd <dig> activity in adipocytes is able to increase adiponectin production, suggesting that the effect seen in intact mice is a direct one on the adipose mass.
effect of bvt <dig> on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity
glucose excursions after a glucose challenge in ogtt were not altered by either rosiglitazone or bvt <dig>  indicating no effect on glucose tolerance in these animals .
the insulin curve is shown in figure 7b.
basal plasma insulin level was decreased for both rosiglitazone  and bvt <dig>  compared with vehicle  indicating increased insulin sensitivity already after seven days of treatment.
to examine more specifically the effects of bvt <dig> on insulin sensitivity, an insulin tolerance test was performed in male kkay mice.
animals were treated with bvt <dig> for seven days prior to the test.
after an overnight fast, animals were given an intraperitoneal bolus of insulin  and blood glucose was followed for two hours.
when fitted to a single exponential equation, the glucose elimination rate constant  were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  .
the apparent increased elimination rate constant did not however show statistical significance .
euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp
to examine the effects of bvt <dig> at the level of the liver more specifically, a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp was performed in male kkay mice.
animals were treated once daily with  <dig> mg/kg bvt <dig> or vehicle for eight days, starting three days after surgery to implant a catheter in the right jugular vein.
after a  <dig> hour fast, the clamp was performed as described in the methods section.
bvt <dig> had no effect on hepatic glucose production.
basal endogenous glucose production was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , and after insulin infusion  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , for vehicle and bvt <dig> respectively.
effect on food intake, body weight and leptin
there were no differences in food intake between different treatment groups over the  <dig> day treatment period .
the group of rosiglitazone treated animals was the only group that gained weight during the study .
to determine the proportion of fat in the animals, fat pads were dissected and weighed and normalized to the whole body weight .
the data showed no significant changes in fat mass after treatment with bvt <dig> or rosiglitazone.
in a separate experiment, body composition was determined by dual energy x-ray absorptimetry to take total body fat into account instead of epididymal fat alone.
these results showed that there were no significant change in total body adiposity after treatment with bvt <dig> compared to vehicle .
by contrast, animals treated with rosiglitazone showed increased adiposity to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % .
as expected, the leptin level was elevated for the rosiglitazone group compared with the vehicle group .
the highest dose group of bvt <dig>  had higher leptin levels than the control group despite no significant changes in total body adiposity.
data are mean ± sem, n =  <dig> per group.
*p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  and ***p <  <dig>  significantly different from vehicle
effect on plasma and liver lipids
total plasma cholesterol was elevated in animals treated with rosiglitazone compared with the control group, and this was accompanied by elevated plasma hdl-cholesterol and lowered cholesterol in the liver , but no effects were seen with bvt <dig>
effects of the 11βhsd <dig> inhibitor bvt <dig> on adiponectin concentrations
to assess the effects of a second 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor, bvt <dig>  on plasma adiponectin concentrations, male kkay mice were treated with three different doses of the compound twice daily for  <dig> days, as described in the methods section.
analysis of the plasma samples showed that bvt <dig> had no significant effect on adiponectin concentrations .
by contrast, rosiglitazone again caused significant increases in plasma adiponectin.
analysis of plasma hba1c concentrations showed that the treatment with bvt <dig> reduced hba1c significantly at  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg, confirming its expected anti-hyperglycemic effects .
discussion
patients with type  <dig> diabetes have high intracellular levels of glucocorticoids  <cit> .
the level is regulated by 11β hsd <dig> and inhibition of this enzyme in the adipose tissue is one possible novel way of treating type  <dig> diabetes.
in contrast to their wild type siblings, 11β hsd <dig> -/- mice lack mrna for 11β hsd <dig> and cannot convert 11-dehydrocorticosterone to active corticosterone  <cit> .
when these mice were fed a high fat diet, blood glucose concentrations were lower compared with wild type animals.
indeed, 11β hsd <dig> -/- mice fed a high fat diet do not become hyperglycemic.
morton et al studied 11β hsd <dig> -/- mice with a focus on lipid metabolism and reported lower plasma triglyceride levels compared with wild type animals  <cit> .
the same group studied mrna expression of leptin and adiponectin in epididymal fat of 11β hsd <dig> -/- mice and saw decreased leptin and increased adiponectin  <cit> .
kershaw et al created a transgenic model in which human 11β hsd <dig> was expressed under the control of the murine adipocyte fatty acid binding protein promoter and thereby increased 11β hsd <dig> expression and activity exclusively in adipose tissue, resulting in a phenotype with less glucocorticoid in adipose tissue due to enhanced inactivation of corticosterone.
this model displayed increased expression of adiponectin in subcutaneous adipose tissue, when fed a high fat diet compared with wild type  <cit> .
this is in accordance with the report of masuzaki et al which describes transgenic mice overexpressing 11β hsd <dig> in adipose tissue with decreased adiponectin expression in mesenteric fat  <cit> .
mesenteric fat was increased nearly four times in this animal and expression of mrna of adiponectin was decreased to 42% compared to non-transgenic mice.
transgenic mice also had reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, measured by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests and insulin tolerance tests, compared to non-transgenic mice.
thus these three animal models implicate an association between glucocorticoid dynamics in adipose tissue and adiponectin expression.
in the present study, we show that treatment with the specific 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor bvt <dig>  increases adiponectin concentrations, both in adipocytes and, quantitatively and qualitatively, in serum.
this is in accordance with other studies where glucocorticoid is reported to inhibit both expression and secretion of adiponectin  <cit> .
adiponectin is an activator of amp activated protein kinase  which is proposed to be a metabolic master switch  <cit> .
activation of ampk is supposed to lead to improved glucose and fat metabolism including increased glucose uptake in muscle, increased insulin sensitivity, increased ffa uptake and oxidation and repressed lipogenesis  <cit> .
interestingly some of these ameliorations are achieved by treatment with bvt <dig>  in this study we show that treatment with the specific 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor bvt <dig>  improves the glucose homeostasis in diabetic kkay mice.
fasting blood glucose was lowered by approximately 25%  after ten days and plasma insulin was reduced already after seven days of treatment.
unfortunately the itt did not show any significant differences in insulin sensitivity between the groups, probably due to a combination of groups of too few animals in which insulin resistance varies substantially, and a varied response to the experimental dose of insulin.
11β hsd <dig> -/- mice have higher expression of uncoupling protein  <dig>  when fed high fat diet and this might be due to the elevated expression in adiponectin  <cit> .
similar metabolic modifications were shown with another 11β hsd inhibitor, compound  <dig>  fasting serum glucose was lowered by 15% and insulin levels were normalised in diet induced obese mice after  <dig> days treatment  <cit> .
the same group also reported decreased food intake and decreased body weight gain.
adiponectin is an important link between type  <dig> diabetes and vascular disease <cit> .
kumada et al showed in their study in men that hypoadiponectinemia was associated with coronary artery disease prevalence even after adjustment for risk factors such as type  <dig> diabetes and body mass index  <cit> .
adiponectin suppresses atherogenesis by inhibiting adherence of monocytes, reducing their phagocytic activity and suppressing accumulation of lipoproteins in the vascular wall  <cit> .
hermanowski-vosatka et al  <cit>  showed that inhibition with compound  <dig>  another 11β hsd inhibitor, slowed plaque progression in a mouse model of atherosclerosis.
we suggest that the beneficial results regarding atherosclerosis may be due, at least in part, to increased adiponectin.
this study did not report on concentrations of adiponectin in 544-treated animals but we hypothesize that prolonged treatment with bvt <dig> will demonstrate similar effects due to elevations in circulating adiponectin.
our earlier 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor, bvt <dig>  has been shown to exert significant effects on feeding behavior and energy balance as well as glucose homeostasis in various animal models of glucose intolerance and type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> .
thus, the compound has shown strong effects in the liver and possibly in the brain.
our analysis here shows that bvt <dig> has no effect on plasma adiponectin concentrations, whilst bvt <dig> has no effects on the hepatic glucose production.
these data indicate therefore that whilst inhibition of 11β hsd <dig> can be expected to be beneficial for treating the pathology of type  <dig> diabetes mellitus, all inhibitors are not the same, and different mechanistic effects can be expected with different compounds.
the differences likely lie in the subtly different pharmacodynamics exerted by the compounds in different tissues in the body.
thus bvt <dig>  which has strong effects in the liver, likely regulates glucose homeostasis in this organ, whilst bvt <dig> has less effect in the liver but upregulates the major insulin sensitizing adipokine adiponectin, due to its greater effects in the adipose tissue.
CONCLUSIONS
in our study we have treated an animal model of type  <dig> diabetes with an 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor bvt <dig> for up to ten days and obtained several ameliorations of the diabetic phenotype, specifically lowered plasma glucose, which is the most important clinical chemistry parameter to improve.
ten days is a relatively short treatment time and a longer treatment could possibly lead to further improvements such as improved dyslipidemia.
increases in adiponectin concentrations may be an integral component in the mechanism of action of 11β hsd <dig> inhibitors which are active in the adipose tissue and may be a useful marker of efficacy during the clinical development of inhibitory compounds.
this approach to the treatment of type  <dig> diabetes might also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
",88,"BACKGROUND
type  <dig> diabetes and cushing's syndrome have similar phenotypes, including visceral obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance  <cit> . in the case of cushing's syndrome, the patients have elevated circulating glucocorticoids whereas patients with type  <dig> diabetes have normal circulating levels but higher intracellular levels  <cit> . the concentration of active glucocorticoids  formed at the cellular level is regulated by the degree of reductase activity of the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  type  <dig> enzyme  <cit> .

glucocorticoids have been shown to decrease the levels of adiponectin in animal models  <cit>  and in humans  <cit> . adiponectin is a hormone secreted exclusively from adipose tissue  <cit> , the concentrations of which are positively correlated with a favorable metabolic phenotype in humans  <cit> . it circulates in serum as a basic trimer, a hexamer, and larger multimeric structures  <cit> . the full-length protein influences hepatic gluconeogenesis whilst the globular domain of adiponectin stimulates β-oxidation in muscle. these effects are mediated by the adipor <dig>  and adipor <dig>  receptors respectively  <cit> . recently it was shown that the appl <dig> adaptor protein binds to the intracellular domain of adiponectin receptors and confers some of adiponectin's actions  <cit> , and thus may be an important mediator of adiponectin-dependent insulin sensitization in skeletal muscle. the mrna expression of adiponectin is reduced in adipose tissue in obese mice and humans  <cit>  although the picture differs somewhat depending on fat depot. adiponectin is not only decreased in obese individuals but also in type  <dig> diabetic patients  <cit>  and a low level is a risk factor for developing this disease  <cit> . physiological doses of adiponectin improve insulin sensitivity in db/db and kkay mice, two mouse models of type  <dig> diabetes, partly by decreasing triglycerides  in liver and muscle tissue  <cit> . treatment with thiazolidinediones increases the expression and secretion of adiponectin in both rodents and humans  <cit> , indicating that changes in this adipokine may be integral to the therapeutic effects of thiazolidinediones  <cit> .

transgenic mice overexpressing 11β hsd1-selectively in adipose tissue develop type  <dig> diabetes and visceral obesity  <cit> , in contrast to the 11β hsd <dig> knockout mouse, which displays a favorable phenotype with normoglycemia and normal weight  <cit> . this animal resists diet-induced obesity, has improved glucose and insulin tolerance and demonstrates favorable changes in cytokine expression, including a doubling in adiponectin. another transgenic mouse overexpressing hsd type  <dig> in adipose tissue, and thereby inhibiting corticosterone exposure intracellularly, also had higher expression of adiponectin than its wild type counterparts when fed a high fat diet  <cit> . various inhibitors of 11β hsd <dig> have been disclosed, with multiple favourable effects on the metabolic phenotype. in addition to increased insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance  <cit> , anti-obesity effects such as reduced food intake, body weight gain and reduced percentage body fat have been reported  <cit> . furthermore, atherosclerotic plaque lesions in apoe knockout mice were improved after treatment with 11β hsd <dig> inhibitors  <cit> . however, despite favourable effects on the insulin-sensitising adipokine adiponectin in genetic models of 11β hsd <dig> inhibition and corticosterone reduction, no such analysis has been reported in pharmacological models. substance bvt <dig> inhibited11β hsd <dig> in adipose tissue. it has good bioavailability  and low clearance, resulting in high cmax values  <cit> . when tested in c57bl <dig> mice, the compound displayed excellent pharmacodynamics in adipose tissue, inhibiting 11β hsd <dig> activity by 90%,  <dig> and  <dig> hours after dosing   <cit> . the aim of this study was to investigate if inhibition of 11β hsd <dig> in adipocytes with the specific inhibitor bvt <dig> affects the concentrations of adiponectin with concomitant impact on glucose homeostasis in diabetic mice. we compared the effects with bvt <dig>  <cit> , another 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor shown to exert its effects through alteration of glucose handling in the liver.

RESULTS
potency and pharmacodynamic activity of 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor bvt116429
bvt <dig> -2--1-ethylamino)-5-methyl-5-thiazol-4-one  is a potent reversible competitive inhibitor of human and mouse 11β hsd <dig> with >  <dig> fold selectivity over human 11β hsd <dig>  inhibitory constants derived from in vitro inhibition assays using purified recombinant mouse and human 11β hsd <dig> were  <dig> and  <dig> nm, respectively . representative data for human the enzyme is shown in figure  <dig>  bvt <dig> had no significant effect on a panel of  <dig> unrelated proteins and ion channels . to determine the effect of bvt <dig> in cells, human primary adipose cells were treated with increasing concentrations of compound and the ability of the cells to convert cortisone to cortisol was assessed using a cortisol elisa assay. repeated assays showed that bvt <dig> inhibited intracellular 11β hsd <dig> with an ic <dig> of  <dig> nm . to understand the degree of 11β hsd <dig> inhibition in liver from mice dosed with bvt <dig> at  <dig> mg/kg, the liver was excised  <dig> h post last dose, minced and exposed to cortisone ex vivo for  <dig> minutes. data showed that the compound inhibits conversion of cortisone to cortisol by 11β hsd <dig> in liver such that two hours post-dosing, liver 11β hsd <dig> activity was reduced by 35% . this contrast with the compounds greater effects in adipose tissue   <cit> . thus, bvt <dig> displays significant inhibitory activity against the enzyme in key target organs after oral dosing in c57/bl6j mice with especially high activity in adipose tissue.

effect of bvt <dig> treatment on plasma glucose
to test the effects of bvt <dig> on the diabetic phenotype of kkay mice, male mice were treated with compound for  <dig> days as described in the methods section. fasting glucose was reduced in animals treated with  <dig> mg/kg bvt <dig>  an effect that was comparable to that of rosiglitazone .

effect of bvt <dig> treatment on adiponectin in vivo and in vitro
different transgenic mouse models with altered 11β hsd <dig> activity or glucocorticoid concentrations demonstrate elevated adiponectin concentrations. for this reason, and considering the apparently greater effects of bvt <dig> on 11β hsd <dig> activity in adipose tissue, we measured adiponectin in kkay mice treated with bvt <dig>  total adiponectin levels were elevated in kkay mice after treatment with both bvt <dig>  and rosiglitazone compared with control . in view of recent findings that the distribution of different adiponectin complexes is critical in determining insulin sensitivity  <cit> , we decided to investigate the complex composition of adiponectin in serum from the kkay mice. the most prominent adiponectin complex in kkay mice was the hexamer . both the hexameric and the high molecular weight  multimeric forms were increased after treatment with bvt <dig>  and rosiglitazone . in order to understand the mechanistic interplay between 11β hsd <dig> inhibition and a concomitant increase of adiponectin levels better, we studied human primary adipocytes in culture. terminally differentiated human adipocytes were treated with bvt <dig> for  <dig> hours in the presence of cortisone. adiponectin concentrations released into the culture medium increased by  <dig> -fold, from  <dig>  ng/ml in the absence of compound to  <dig>  ng/ml in its presence . thus, inhibition of 11β hsd <dig> activity in adipocytes is able to increase adiponectin production, suggesting that the effect seen in intact mice is a direct one on the adipose mass.

effect of bvt <dig> on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity
glucose excursions after a glucose challenge in ogtt were not altered by either rosiglitazone or bvt <dig>  indicating no effect on glucose tolerance in these animals . the insulin curve is shown in figure 7b. basal plasma insulin level was decreased for both rosiglitazone  and bvt <dig>  compared with vehicle  indicating increased insulin sensitivity already after seven days of treatment.

to examine more specifically the effects of bvt <dig> on insulin sensitivity, an insulin tolerance test was performed in male kkay mice. animals were treated with bvt <dig> for seven days prior to the test. after an overnight fast, animals were given an intraperitoneal bolus of insulin  and blood glucose was followed for two hours. when fitted to a single exponential equation, the glucose elimination rate constant  were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . the apparent increased elimination rate constant did not however show statistical significance .

effect on food intake, body weight and leptin
there were no differences in food intake between different treatment groups over the  <dig> day treatment period . the group of rosiglitazone treated animals was the only group that gained weight during the study . to determine the proportion of fat in the animals, fat pads were dissected and weighed and normalized to the whole body weight . the data showed no significant changes in fat mass after treatment with bvt <dig> or rosiglitazone. in a separate experiment, body composition was determined by dual energy x-ray absorptimetry to take total body fat into account instead of epididymal fat alone. these results showed that there were no significant change in total body adiposity after treatment with bvt <dig> compared to vehicle . by contrast, animals treated with rosiglitazone showed increased adiposity to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . as expected, the leptin level was elevated for the rosiglitazone group compared with the vehicle group . the highest dose group of bvt <dig>  had higher leptin levels than the control group despite no significant changes in total body adiposity.

effect on plasma and liver lipids
total plasma cholesterol was elevated in animals treated with rosiglitazone compared with the control group, and this was accompanied by elevated plasma hdl-cholesterol and lowered cholesterol in the liver , but no effects were seen with bvt <dig> 

effects of the 11βhsd <dig> inhibitor bvt <dig> on adiponectin concentrations
to assess the effects of a second 11β hsd <dig> inhibitor, bvt <dig>  on plasma adiponectin concentrations, male kkay mice were treated with three different doses of the compound twice daily for  <dig> days, as described in the methods section. analysis of the plasma samples showed that bvt <dig> had no significant effect on adiponectin concentrations . by contrast, rosiglitazone again caused significant increases in plasma adiponectin. analysis of plasma hba1c concentrations showed that the treatment with bvt <dig> reduced hba1c significantly at  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg, confirming its expected anti-hyperglycemic effects .

a substantial body of evidence indicates that reduced plasma adiponectin levels may be key in the development of insulin resistance, type  <dig> diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. glucocorticoids decrease the levels of adiponectin in animals and humans. cortisone is transformed to its active form cortisol, via 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  type  <dig>  this study sought to ascertain if inhibition of 11β hsd <dig> with a new selective inhibitor, bvt <dig>  affects the concentrations of circulating adiponectin with concomitant effects on glucose homeostasis in diabetic mice.

despite the routine success at long-term culturing of primary rodent neurons  <cit> , the application of this potentially very useful approach for modeling of neuronal cell aging remains limited.
the standard protocols that allow prolonged cns cell culturing  are now widely available  <cit> , however, systematic studies of the differentiation state, cytochemical, and morphological characteristics of brain cells remaining viable over long term in vitro are needed.
although in vivo animal models can be used to reveal many important aspects of neuronal development, dysfunction, and degeneration, the inherent complexity of nervous tissue often obscures the overall understanding of molecular, biochemical, and structural observations.
the in vitro system lacks an intact tissue environment; nevertheless, the presence of a homogenous cell population allows us to identify specific mechanisms underlying the chemical and morphological changes seen in vivo  <cit> .
using long term primary cell culture to decipher the underlying development of the cells of the hippocampus allows examination of where the initial dysfunction takes place that leads to some of the symptoms of neurodegeneration.
understanding what a mature neuron looks like, and when it matures in culture, will help facilitate the development of more efficient in vitro testing.
in the current study we used the lack of nestin immunoreactivity, as well as various morphological categorizations, to classify our cultures as mature.
nestin is a type vi neurofilament expressed in the developing cns, specifically in progenitor cells undergoing differentiation  <cit> .
specific mature neuronal and astrocytic markers, map- <dig> and gfap, have been found to be co-expressed with nestin in early, primary, neuronal cell cultures  <cit> .
the co-localization of these markers and nestin indicate the event of differentiation.
conversely, there should be little to no expression of the intermediate fiber marker nestin in mature primary neuronal cultures  <cit> .
increased amyloid-beta peptide  formation is a common accompaniment of brain aging  <cit> .
accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates, including the misfolded aβ protein, is the manifestation of progressively deteriorating capacity of aging biological systems to withstand extrinsic and intrinsic hazards  <cit> .
our current study was designed to investigate the possibility of endogenous amyloid beta peptide formation and accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates in hippocampal neurons during their development and maturation in vitro.
aβ peptides arise from the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein   <cit> .
β-and γ-secretases cleave the unprocessed app in succession, resulting in the formation of aβ peptide  <cit> .
numerous studies have used rodent primary hippocampal cell cultures as an experimental model of normal biogenesis of aβ  <cit> .
rat hippocampal cells in primary cultures express app <dig>  app <dig>  and app <dig>  <cit>  and the amyloidogenic route of app processing resulting in the endogenous aβ1- <dig> or aβ1- <dig> generation may naturally occur in primary neuronal cultures  <cit> .
the aβ monomers released from cells transform into β-pleated sheet aggregates to initiate the process of neuronal degeneration associated with the decline in metabolic activity and oxidative damage of cultured hippocampal neurons  <cit> .
it was reported that the rodent aβ is less likely to form large fibrillary structures due to three amino acid substitutions compared to the human sequence.
nevertheless, neurotoxic and pro-oxidant properties of the rat variety of aβ 1- <dig> have proven to be the same as human  <cit> .
most amyloid peptides interact strongly with cell membranes and this interaction is enhanced by conditions which favor β-sheet formation.
the excessive release of aβ from cultured rat hippocampal neurons can result in the increase of amyloid-binding dye fluorescence in the culture medium and aβ-mediated toxicity  <cit> .
although increased aβ formation and the production of aggregates have been observed accompanying the process of neuronal aging  <cit> , low levels of aβ derived from the natural processing of app isoforms have been found both in vivo and in vitro  <cit> .
normal physiologic levels of aβ are thought to be important in regulating neurotransmission  <cit> , consequently many researchers suggest that aβ should only be regarded as toxic when the production and degradation are imbalanced  <cit> .
overall, the purpose of this study is to investigate the usefulness of long term primary hippocampal cell culture for understanding the link between endogenous aβ production, differentiation and maturation in vitro.
in order to discern this link we aim to identify criteria by which a culture can be classified as mature.
these classifications can help us properly assess the endogenous levels of aβ and the accumulation of misfolded aβ proteins into aggregates as physiological, and not pathological, processes of aging.
the ability to classify the maturity of neurons will also strengthen the cell culture model as a whole, giving researchers the ability to more definitively speak about influences on the aging nervous system.
RESULTS
the long-term hippocampal cell culture maturation and aging
primary embryonic hippocampal culture preparations used in this study are classified as moderate-high density .
soon after the adherence to the surface of the cell culture plate, viable hippocampal cells began expressing marker proteins that indicate their commitment to either the neuronal or astrocytic differentiation.
the representative dic microscopy images in figure 1a illustrate that the cells were initially small with no, or a very small number of, neuritic outgrowths at  <dig> div, and later form a visible network by  <dig> div.
extensive networking of neurites and the defined appearance of pyramidal cells at div 21- <dig>  indicated this was a stage of maturity for the cell culture.
aging hippocampal cells  appeared to have progressively less defined connections with excessive bundling of neurites and larger, more defined cell bodies.
consistent with the dic imaging of developing neural networks were images of nestin/map- <dig> immunofluorescence from the long-term hippocampal cultures of different ages .
in 7- <dig> div hippocampal cells nestin immunoreactivity was generally localized within the axonal growth cones.
neuronal maturation associated with extensive dendritic arborization was characterized by a gradual decline of the expression of this immature neurofilament protein and the increase of map- <dig> expression.
as shown in figure 1b, after  <dig> div the majority of the neuronal population in the long-term hippocampal cell culture became predominantly map- <dig> expressing principle pyramidal neurons.
nevertheless, nestin immunoreactivity could be detected in some cells until div  <dig>  hippocampal neuronal cells expressing nestin along with map- <dig> were typically found in cell clusters at this age .
observations of the mature hippocampal primary cultures during their long-term maintenance clearly showed that the stationary phase, during which cultured cells showed no noticeable changes in morphology, may continue until div  <dig>  signs of neuritic network deterioration began to occur after  <dig> div.
immunoreactivity of map- <dig> in these aged hippocampal cell cultures also revealed varicosities along the processes, giving them a 'beaded' appearance, as shown in figure 1b at  <dig> div.
primary rat fetal hippocampal cultures were neuron-enriched throughout long-term maintenance.
the fully mature hippocampal cell culture  contained  <dig> ± 5% gfap positive cells.
the number of astrocytes remained stable throughout the cell culture aging period and did not exceed 20% even in very old  cultures .
however, the astrocytic cell morphology and gfap expression changed with the aging of the cell culture age .
in long-term hippocampal cultures of 45- <dig> div, astrocytes exhibited very intensive gfap immunostaining and displayed an extensively branched network of processes .
gfap expressing cells had thicker processes relative to map- <dig> expressing cells, and their nuclei appeared to be flat and more oblong than map- <dig> expressing cells.
results of immunoblotting analyses of neuronal  and astrocytic  marker proteins in hippocampal cell lysates  were consistent with the results of the immunofluorescent microscopy and neuronal/astrocytic cell counting.
the map-2/gfap immunoreactivity ratio significantly  decreased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  between  <dig> and  <dig> div when hippocampal cell cultures reached the peak of their development.
no significant changes in the map-2/gfap ratio have been found in fully mature hippocampal cultures between  <dig> div and  <dig> div .
the end of the stationary phase  was marked by the significant decrease of the map-2/gfap ratio at  <dig> div , which was attributed to the sharp drop in map- <dig> immunoreactivity but not to the increase in gfap immunoreactivity.
the observed changes in levels of immunoreactive map- <dig> corresponded well with the results of anti-map- <dig> immunofluorescent microscopy, revealing signs of neuronal dendritic network degeneration at this time point .
consistently, as shown by the images of the western blots in figure  <dig>  the intensity of protein bands corresponding to synaptodendritic markers map- <dig> and psd  <dig> exhibited pronounced decreases between  <dig> div and  <dig> div compared to nse, gs and β-actin.
amyloid beta -peptide release and deposition of β-pleated sheet protein aggregates
the presence of specific aβ 1- <dig> immunofluorescence in cultured hippocampal neurons indicates the possibility of endogenous aβ production.
only negligible levels of extracellular aβ 1- <dig> immunoreactivity were detected by direct elisa in the cell culture medium at div  <dig> and div  <dig> .
the progressive accumulation of aβ 1- <dig> in the growth medium was starting in the stationary phase of cell culture development  and peaked at 120- <dig> nm during the period of in vitro aging between  <dig> div and  <dig> div .
in this study, the long-term maintenance of hippocampal cell cultures continued until  <dig> div.
live-dead staining was routinely performed to determine cell viability.
double labeling with calcein am and congo red revealed the presence of cells with membrane integrity and the capability to retain the fluorescent product of the calcein am hydrolysis fairly long into culturing .
results of the congo red staining of long-term hippocampal cultures at different stages of their development are shown in figure 4b.
congo red staining of cell bodies or processes was rarely observed in hippocampal cell cultures until  <dig> div.
however, after  <dig> div the congo red stained amyloid-like depositions were frequently found in association with the dendritic network and in the cell body .
in cultures older than  <dig> days, increasing numbers of cells with congo red-positive somata were observed .
total number of cells containing congo-red positive amyloidal aggregates was much higher in older cells .
co-labeling with calcein am and congo red detected many calcein am-positive cells some with the presence of congo red, as shown by the yellow arrows in figure 4d.
discussion
the technology of cns cell culturing continues to evolve, bringing forward novel perspectives to advance the understanding of basic principles of neural functioning by using isolated neural cells in a controlled environment.
in this study we used the techniques for culturing rat fetal hippocampal neurons developed by brewer and co-authors  <cit> .
when this method is used, isolated neurons remain viable for long periods of time without the need for astroglial feeder co-cultures  <cit> .
our own experience  <cit>  and reports from other investigators  <cit> , have documented the successful maintenance of viable cultures containing primary rodent fetal neurons for 60- <dig> days or longer.
the ability to maintain cell cultures for extended periods of time allows further understanding of the fundamental processes of development and aging within the neuronal populations.
despite the abundance of published studies carried out in primary cns cultures, important aspects of neuronal differentiation in vitro remain ambiguous.
the data reported here describe the long-term time course of maturation of isolated primary rat hippocampal cells in culture.
we report that at  <dig> div, isolated hippocampal neurons completely switch from the expression of the intermediate type vi neurofilaments  to the synthesis of more advanced neurofilaments containing map- <dig>  these data suggest that hippocampal cultures younger than  <dig> div do not resemble fully mature neurons as seen in vivo  <cit> .
this culturing protocol uses a medium specifically formulated to promote neuronal survival and does not support glial proliferation  <cit> .
however, it does not prevent the development of viable progenitor cells from differentiating into astrocytes during the development of the cell culture.
astrocytic development is sometimes viewed as a necessary event for the long-term survival of neuronal cells in culture  <cit> .
we found that the prevalence of the neuronal phenotype  is maintained through all stages of the cell culture development.
cell populations in fully mature, long-term hippocampal cell cultures could include up to 20% gfap-positive cells and relative numbers of astrocytes did not show further increase during the cell culture aging period.
the gradual increase in gfap expression and enrichment of the network of gfap-positive cell processes, may be explained by slow  maturation of existing astrocytes in b27-supplemented neurobasal medium, which is not optimized to support astrocytic growth  <cit> .
alternatively, the enhanced arborization and gfap expression may be attributable to astrocytic activation adjunct to the cell culture aging  <cit> .
as in vivo, primary long-term cell culture aging is associated with the progressive oxidative damage of hippocampal neurons  <cit>  and astrocytes are known to respond to various physiological or noxious stimuli including oxidative stress with increased expression of gfap  <cit> .
however, the results of our current study show signs of progressive degeneration of both map- <dig> and gfap-containing networks during the later stages in the long-term hippocampal cell cultures.
our study adds to the literature that investigates the endogenous release of aβ  <cit>  and potential deposition of amyloid-like aggregates in the process of development and aging of isolated hippocampal cells  <cit> .
consistently, we have detected the expression of app and the presence of intracellular aβ 1- <dig> immunoreactivity in long-term hippocampal cultures.
the longitudinal monitoring of extracellular aβ 1- <dig> immunoreactivity in primary hippocampal cell culture from div  <dig> until div  <dig> has shown that young, actively differentiating hippocampal cells have very low levels of physiological secretion of amyloidogenic aβ.
direct aβ elisa measurements for 7-15div cell cultures that we report are consistent with similar data, which can be found in recent publications  <cit> .
notably, our experiments show that the increase of extracellular aβ coincided with the complete maturation of synaptodendritic networks in hippocampal cultures, which indicates a potential relationship between increasing neuronal activity and the secretion of aβ.
indeed, several recent studies  <cit>  suggested that the formation of aβ monomers play a role in the regulation of synaptic transmission.
amyloid-like protein aggregates are thought to disrupt normal neuronal functioning by irreversible spontaneous insertion into cell membranes.
the existing evidence suggests that the misfolded and aggregated proteins are essential elements in the vast majority of age-related neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> .
therefore, we used the congo red staining to determine whether the changes in extracellular levels of aβ 1- <dig> were associated with the deposition of β-amyloids in long-term hippocampal cell cultures.
the presence of congo red-positive aggregates associated with the network of processes and cell bodies of hippocampal cells appeared to mark the beginning of the period of decay in the long-term cell culture.
congo red stained aggregates were consistently observed in long-term cultures after  <dig> div when the levels of extracellular aβ 1- <dig> grew higher than  <dig> nm.
the appearance of cell-associated amyloid-like aggregates became more frequent as the cell cultures continued to age and correlated well with morphological signs of deterioration of dendritic networks.
intriguingly, the cell culture ages when the presence of β-amyloidal aggregates were observed in the current study corresponded well with previously reported time course of protein oxidative damage in aging long-term hippocampal cell cultures  <cit> .
the aβ release and the following changes of the specific β-amyloid labeling preceded the decline of cell densities in aging hippocampal cultures.
the pronounced increase in the number of cells exhibiting positive congo red staining of the somata in  <dig> div long-term cultures could be explained by the increased membrane permeability of decaying hippocampal cells which allowed congo red access to the intracellular compartment.
nevertheless, the overlap between the calcein am and the congo red positive labeling indicated that, even in very old cultures, amyloid like aggregates could be found in the remaining alive hippocampal cells, which continue to maintain intact membrane integrity.
on the other hand, the appearance of congo red fluorescence in dead  cells is consistent with the suggestion that the presence of β-sheet structured protein aggregates may be a marker of neural cell injury and decay  <cit> .
studies of primary neuronal cultures beyond div  <dig> are infrequent  <cit> .
moreover, studies characterizing the development and senescence of neuronal cells in vitro without any treatment are difficult to identify in the literature.
the current study not only joins the limited literature of long term cultures past div  <dig>  we also characterized some important developmental milestones of note when using primary cell cultures.
we found that neurons in primary culture undergo distinct developmental phases: differentiation, maturation, steady state, and senescence.
viability of these cell cultures was verified using immunoblotting of important structural proteins, immunoreactivity of important neuronal and glial markers, and differential interference contrast images to track visible damage on the cells.
differentiation  was characterized by the presence of nestin immunoreactivty and the prevalence of small cells with short processes and little to no branching in dic images.
maturation  was classified as a time when the majority of nestin expressing cells began expressing map- <dig> , and a more defined network of neurites and larger, more defined cell bodies were present in dic images.
the steady state  was defined as the point in time when the neuronal cells in culture no longer displayed any noticeable changes.
senescence  was defined as a decrease in total cell number, the presence of ""beading"" of the processes, a steady rise in aβ production and an increase in aggregate formation.
CONCLUSIONS
the phenomenon of cellular aging takes place in long-term primary neuronal cell cultures  <cit> .
the present study found that endogenous cell senescence-associated amyloidogenesis in vitro occur in long-term hippocampal cell cultures.
this outcome presents similar observations seen in the patterns of neuronal aging seen in animals, therefore, suggesting the possibility that long-term primary cell culture could serve as a model for particular aspects of aging, such as the study of neurodegenerative diseases.
in sum, our results indicate that long-term primary cell cultures may be a useful instrument for designing and testing effective ways to delay neuronal senescence and other age related phenomenon.

","BACKGROUND
long-term primary neuronal cultures are a useful tool for the investigation of biochemical processes associated with neuronal senescence. improvements in available technology make it possible to observe maturation of neural cells isolated from different regions of the rodent brain over a prolonged period in vitro. existing experimental evidence suggests that cellular aging occurs in mature, long-term, primary neuronal cell cultures. however, detailed studies of neuronal development in vitro are needed to demonstrate the validity of long-term cell culture-based models for investigation of the biochemical mechanisms of in vitro neuronal development and senescence.


RESULTS
in the current study, neuron-enriched hippocampal cell cultures were used to analyze the differentiation and degeneration of hippocampal neurons over a two month time period. the expression of different neuronal and astroglial biomarkers was used to determine the cytochemical characteristics of hippocampal cells in long-term cultures of varying ages. it was observed that the expression of the intermediate filament nestin was absent from cultures older than  <dig> days in vitro , and the expression of neuronal or astrocytic markers appeared to replace nestin. additionally, morphological evaluations of neuronal integrity and hoescht staining were used to assess the cellular conditions in the process of hippocampal culture development and aging. it was found that there was an increase in endogenous production of aβ1- <dig> and an increase in the accumulation of congo red-binding amyloidal aggregates associated with the aging of neurons in primary culture. in vitro changes in the morphology of co-existing astrocytes and cell culture age-dependent degeneration of neurodendritic network resemble features of in vivo brain aging at the cellular level.

"BACKGROUND
slowed muscle relaxation due to persistent electrical discharges is the hallmark of myotonia  <cit> .
myotonia occurs naturally in several species  as a result of genetic deficiency of the skeletal muscle clc- <dig> channel, a disease which in humans is termed myotonia congenita  <cit> .
it can also be produced experimentally by blocking muscle cl- channels of normal muscle, for example with 9-anthracene carboxylic acid , p-chloro-phenoxy-propionic acid, or  <dig> -dichlorphenoxyacetate  <cit> .
muscle from humans and animals with myotonia congenita has physiological, structural and biochemical alterations which transcend the loss of clc- <dig> channels, including hypertrophy  or atrophy , alterations in fiber type composition , and altered amounts of parvalbumin  <cit> .
these downstream changes may contribute to the complex abnormalities in contractile performance found in clc- <dig> deficient muscle, in particular changes that occur during the contractile phase of the contraction-relaxation cycle, such as impaired force production and alterations in rate of fatigue during isometric contractions  <cit> .
humans with myotonia experience limb muscle stiffness which interferes particularly with the initiation of movements  <cit> .
involvement of respiratory muscles may lead to ""breathing difficulties"", dyspnea, sleep apnea, and daytime alveolar hypoventilation  <cit> .
for many subjects the myotonia has an adverse effect on their ability to engage in sports  <cit> .
the extent of myotonia, however, dissipates with repetitive contractions, the so-called warm-up phenomenon  <cit> .
this has been examined in the context of a short series of low intensity contractions reducing myotonia during subsequent low intensity contractions  <cit>  rather than in the context of repetitive contractions of sufficient severity to produce fatigue, such as might occur during athletic activities.
the general purpose of the present study was therefore to examine myotonia during fatigue-inducing stimulation.
based on previous studies examining the decline of myotonia in response to non-fatiguing contractions, the specific hypotheses of the present study were that a) myotonia declines more rapidly than force during fatigue-inducing stimulation, and b) the rate of decline of the myotonia during fatigue-inducing stimulation is affected by the frequency of stimulation producing fatigue .
in order to avoid the effects of downstream structural and biochemical changes  resulting from genetic clc- <dig> channel deficiency that can affect muscle fatigue properties in manners apart from the myotonia itself, the present study utilized cl- channel blockade with 9-ac to produce myotonia in otherwise normal muscle rather than testing muscle that is genetically deficient in cl- channels.
muscles pertinent to breathing , fast twitch movements , and slow twitch movements  were tested to determine whether 9-ac has varying effects on muscles with different fiber type compositions.
methods
studies were performed using adult male sprague-dawley rats .
all protocols were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee and conformed to animal care guidelines established by the national institutes of health.
rats were well-anesthetized using a rodent anesthetic cocktail .
the edl and soleus muscles were removed from the legs with intact tendons, and the diaphragm muscles were removed with intact rib origins and central tendon insertions.
contractile studies were performed in physiological solution consisting of :  <dig> nacl,  <dig> kcl,  <dig>  cacl <dig>   <dig> mgso <dig>   <dig> nah2po <dig>   <dig> nahco <dig>  and  <dig> glucose, with the ph adjusted to  <dig> - <dig>  at 37°c while being aerated with 95% o2-5%co <dig>  the diaphragm muscle was cut into small strips parallel to the fiber direction keeping origin and insertion intact , and mounted vertically in a double-jacketed chamber while the temperature was maintained at 37°c.
the soleus and edl muscles were similarly mounted in the same chamber by the attached tendons, except that they were left whole and not cut into strips like the diaphragm.
a pair of platinum electrodes was placed parallel to the diaphragm muscle strips or limb muscles, and supramaximal voltages were delivered with a pulse width of  <dig> ms. the lengths of the muscle samples were adjusted until the twitch force was maximized , and kept at this length for the duration of the contractile study.
ten minutes after the diaphragm muscle or limb muscle  had equilibrated to the kreb's solution, three twitch contractions were recorded  <dig> seconds apart to determine the baseline force of the muscle.
three minutes thereafter, another three twitches were recorded  <dig> seconds apart to verify stability of the muscle sample .
subsequently  <dig> ml kreb's solution containing 9-ac was added to half of the muscle samples to obtain a bath concentration of  <dig> μm, and to the other half of the muscle samples  <dig> ml of the kreb's solution without 9-ac was added.
twenty minutes later repetitive train stimulation was initiated.
this consisted of intermittent 20-hz or 50-hz train stimulations, with a train length of  <dig>  s and one train every three seconds.
the relatively long inter-train interval was needed due to the markedly slowed rate of relaxation in the presence of 9-ac, as this allowed time for muscle force to return back to baseline prior to the subsequent train.
due to the slow isometric kinetics of the soleus muscle, contractions have a high degree of fusion during  <dig> hz stimulation, impairing the ability to measure contraction and relaxation times.
therefore soleus was only studied during  <dig> hz stimulation.
muscle contractile performance was assessed with respect to four parameters , and in all instances this was relative to baseline passive tension.
peak force was defined as the largest value that occurred during the portion of the contraction while the muscle was being electrically stimulated .
these force values were normalized relative to twitch force before drug addition to factor out the effects of variability among muscle samples in absolute force related to variability in animal size and muscle sample size, similar to previous studies of a similar nature  <cit> .
contraction time was defined as the time from the onset of force production to the top of the first peak of the non-fused contraction; values for contraction time are not presented in those instances in which a distinct first peak was not discernable .
half-relaxation time was the time required for force to decrease from the peak value at the end of electrical stimulation to 50% of this value.
late relaxation time was the time for force to decline from 50% of peak to 10% of peak.
these four values were quantified for a total duration of six minutes.
all data presented are means and sd.
statistical analysis of paired data was performed with a paired t-test.
statistical analysis of data obtained during repetitive stimulation was performed with analysis of variance for repeated measures followed by the newman-keuls post-hoc test in the event of significance by analysis of variance.
the level for statistical significance was set at p <  <dig>  .
RESULTS
diaphragm
the effects of 9-ac on diaphragm force, contraction time, half relaxation time and late relaxation time at the outset of repetitive stimulation are listed in table  <dig>  9-ac increased force and contraction time during  <dig> hz but not  <dig> hz stimulation.
half relaxation and late relaxation times increased during both  <dig> hz and  <dig> hz stimulation, reaching values in the hundreds of milliseconds.
furthermore, values were generally longer for late relaxation  than for the half-relaxation time .
none of these parameters changed at the outset of repetitive stimulation in the control muscle samples which were not treated with 9-ac.
the effect of kreb's solution and 9-ac on diaphragm muscle at the outset of repetitive stimulation on peak force, contraction time, half relaxation time, and late relaxation time during  <dig> hz and  <dig> hz stimulation.
values are means ± sd.
asterisks indicate significant differences between before and after 9-ac data.
force values for diaphragm during repetitive  <dig> and  <dig> hz stimulation are depicted in figure 2a.
during  <dig> hz repetitive stimulation, force declined rapidly in muscles that were treated with 9-ac after the initial 9-ac-induced augmentation.
at one minute into the fatigue-inducing stimulation and all points thereafter, force values were equivalent in 9-ac treated and untreated muscles.
in contrast, force values did not differ for drug-treated and untreated diaphragm at any time during  <dig> hz stimulation.
contraction time also was prolonged by 9-ac during  <dig> hz stimulation  and not measurable during  <dig> hz stimulation because successive stimulation was  <dig> ms apart and contraction time was greater than  <dig> ms. this prolongation waned with repetitive fatigue-inducing stimulation, but did not fully dissipate over the course of six minutes.
both the half relaxation time  and the late relaxation time  were prolonged substantially by 9-ac, but eventually declined to normal or near-normal values during fatigue-inducing stimulation.
the decline was more precipitous for the early compared to the late phase of relaxation as well as during  <dig> hz compared with  <dig> hz stimulation.
the rate at which myotonia resolved was much faster than the rate at which force decreased, in that myotonia was almost completely resolved over the first  <dig> seconds of stimulation whereas force continued to decline for the full duration of stimulation .
furthermore, during  <dig> hz stimulation the mechanical myotonia was substantially resolved before there was any appreciable force loss.
limb muscles
soleus muscle did not demonstrate myotonia in response to 9-ac .
there was a mild increase in force , but contraction time , half relaxation time  and late relaxation time  were unaffected.
in contrast, the response of edl was similar in most respects to that of the diaphragm.
peak edl force increased during  <dig> hz but only minimally so during  <dig> hz stimulation , and for  <dig> hz stimulation this waned over time with repetitive stimulation.
however, contraction time was not altered by 9-ac at either stimulation frequency .
both half-relaxation time  and late relaxation time  of the edl were prolonged by 9-ac.
all relaxation times prolonged by 9-ac normalized rapidly during repetitive stimulation, and this occurred faster than the rate at which force declined, in that myotonia was almost completely resolved over the first  <dig> seconds of stimulation whereas force continued to decline for the full duration of stimulation .
as seen with the diaphragm, during  <dig> hz stimulation the mechanical myotonia was substantially resolved before there was any appreciable force loss.
discussion
the inability of muscles to relax normally after voluntary contractions is characteristic of the disease myotonia.
the results of this study showed that mechanical myotonia decreases rapidly during fatigue-inducing stimulation.
furthermore, myotonia was found to decrease faster than force in both the diaphragm and edl muscles.
the normalization of relaxation times was slightly faster at a higher frequency  than a lower frequency  in the diaphragm muscle; however this may have been due to the effects of myotonia being less during  <dig> hz than  <dig> hz stimulation.
furthermore, the resolution of myotonia was also slightly faster in the edl muscle than the diaphragm muscle, although again possibly because of differences in the magnitude of the myotonia.
both the diaphragm and edl muscles had much larger degrees of myotonia than the soleus in response to 9-ac.
in addition, force production increased at the lower stimulation frequency  in the diaphragm and edl, and increased slightly in the soleus at this frequency, but did not increase at the higher frequency  in any of the three muscles with 9-ac.
contraction time increased only in the diaphragm during  <dig> hz stimulation.
myotonia, whether genetically- or drug-induced, decreases during repeated contractions, this resolution being termed the ""warm up"" phenomenon.
this has been described in clinical reports of humans with myotonia congenita and is also apparent when observing the behavior of genetically myotonic mice  <cit> .
physiological manifestations when tested experimentally include improved rate of muscle relaxation and diminution of the duration and intensity of persistent electromyographic activity following repetitive muscle activation.
one of the early experimental studies of the warm up phenomenon was that performed by senges and rudel  <cit>  in a model of myotonia induced by  <dig> -dichlorphenoxyacetate.
they examined the effects of a conditioning tetanus preceding a test contraction by  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> seconds.
the shortest time interval virtually abolished myotonia, with the effect diminishing markedly as the time interval increased.
the warm up phenomenon was described by heller et al.
<cit>  in the original report of genetically myotonic mice.
this was demonstrated based on electromyographic recordings from affected muscle in response to direct peripheral nerve stimulation rather than on measurements of muscle force.
heller and colleagues  <cit>  described the myotonia as declining with repeated trials at  <dig> second intervals, but recovering when the muscle has rested for one minute.
the warm-up phenomenon was also studied by heimann et al  <cit> .
edl muscles from myotonic adr mutants and adr-mdx double mutants were shown to have similar degrees of myotonia as quantified by the myotonia index  <cit>  .
furthermore, they had similar degrees to which the myotonia improved when contractions were preceded by a series of single twitches and incomplete tetanic stimulations.
however, the study also found that myotonia symptoms were more pronounced in adr than adr-mdx muscle, but adr-mdx mice had higher levels of weight reduction and premature death.
in contrast, for the soleus the adr mutant had a significantly higher myotonia index than the adr-mdx mutant .
data for the warm up phenomenon were not depicted for the soleus.
van beekvelt et al.
<cit>  studied three humans with myotonia and defined the warming-up phenomenon as the force recovery phase after initial paresis during a sustained voluntary contraction.
this study hypothesized that warming-up was due to the enhanced activation of na+-k+-atpase during exercise, and used ouabain  to test this.
however, it was found that ouabain infusion did not prevent recovery from transient paresis.
therefore, it was concluded that the warm-up phenomenon was not due to na+-k+-atpase.
taken together, the above studies provide a comprehensive picture of the manner in which myotonia improves following brief contractions, but these studies had not examined changes in myotonia during the course of repetitive fatigue-inducing contractions.
the latter issue has been examined to a limited extent in a previous study from our lab in which we examined isotonic contractions of diaphragm muscle from genetically myotonic mice  <cit> .
diaphragm from these mice had lesser degrees of myotonia than seen in the diaphragm of the present study.
total relaxation time during a singe train contraction ranged from ~ <dig>  to  <dig>  seconds in contrast to values exceeding  <dig> seconds with 9-ac in the present study.
in the genetically myotonic mice, repetitive train stimulation at a frequency of  <dig> hz resulted in a rapid reduction in relaxation time over the course of  <dig> seconds, with minimal changes thereafter during the subsequent  <dig> seconds.
the present study expands on our previous findings  <cit>  in several manners.
we found that the reduction of myotonia during fatigue-inducing contractions occurs during isometric as well as isotonic contractions, and in the drug-induced myotonia model as well as genetic myotonia.
furthermore, the present study indicates that the resolution of myotonia varies as a function of the frequency of muscle stimulation.
in addition the extent of drug-induced myotonia differed among the three muscles studied, with the slow fiber type predominance of the soleus appearing to have had a protective effect.
finally, the present data indicate that the time course of the warm-up phenomenon is much faster than that of force loss during fatigue-inducing contractions.
one of the limitations of the present study is that the studies were done in vitro, under conditions in which there is no blood flow and thus no delivery of nutrients and/or impaired removal of potentially adverse metabolites.
thus the development of fatigue may have occurred faster in the drug-induced myotonia model than would occur in vivo in humans or animals with genetic clc- <dig> chloride channel deficient myotonia.
a second limitation is that the genetic muscle diseases that cause myotonia are a heterogeneous group which include not only two variants of clc- <dig> deficient myotonia but also myotonic dystrophy.
several of these disorders have features in addition to the myotonia, which for some includes muscle weakness.
among these additional features, muscle weakness in particular may impact the rate at which fatigue develops, thereby changing the temporal relationship between the improvement of the myotonia and the reduction of force in response to repetitive vigorous contractions.
CONCLUSIONS
fatigue-inducing contractions were shown to dissipate the amount of mechanical myotonia induced by the chloride channel blocker 9-ac.
however the rate at which this occurred was considerably faster than the drop in force over time, consistent with different mechanisms accounting for the warm up phenomenon and the production of fatigue.
from a clinical perspective this suggests that subjects with myotonia need not warm up to a sufficiently large extent to produce muscle fatigue in order for the myotonia to dissipate, but nonetheless suggest a role for vigorous rather than more modest contractions as a means for resolving the muscle myotonia more quickly.

one of the early experimental studies of the warm up phenomenon was that performed by senges and rudel  <cit>  in a model of myotonia induced by  <dig> -dichlorphenoxyacetate. they examined the effects of a conditioning tetanus preceding a test contraction by  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> seconds. the shortest time interval virtually abolished myotonia, with the effect diminishing markedly as the time interval increased.

the warm up phenomenon was described by heller et al. <cit>  in the original report of genetically myotonic mice. this was demonstrated based on electromyographic recordings from affected muscle in response to direct peripheral nerve stimulation rather than on measurements of muscle force. heller and colleagues  <cit>  described the myotonia as declining with repeated trials at  <dig> second intervals, but recovering when the muscle has rested for one minute.

the warm-up phenomenon was also studied by heimann et al  <cit> . edl muscles from myotonic adr mutants and adr-mdx double mutants were shown to have similar degrees of myotonia as quantified by the myotonia index  <cit>  . furthermore, they had similar degrees to which the myotonia improved when contractions were preceded by a series of single twitches and incomplete tetanic stimulations. however, the study also found that myotonia symptoms were more pronounced in adr than adr-mdx muscle, but adr-mdx mice had higher levels of weight reduction and premature death. in contrast, for the soleus the adr mutant had a significantly higher myotonia index than the adr-mdx mutant . data for the warm up phenomenon were not depicted for the soleus.

van beekvelt et al.  <cit>  studied three humans with myotonia and defined the warming-up phenomenon as the force recovery phase after initial paresis during a sustained voluntary contraction. this study hypothesized that warming-up was due to the enhanced activation of na+-k+-atpase during exercise, and used ouabain  to test this. however, it was found that ouabain infusion did not prevent recovery from transient paresis. therefore, it was concluded that the warm-up phenomenon was not due to na+-k+-atpase.

taken together, the above studies provide a comprehensive picture of the manner in which myotonia improves following brief contractions, but these studies had not examined changes in myotonia during the course of repetitive fatigue-inducing contractions. the latter issue has been examined to a limited extent in a previous study from our lab in which we examined isotonic contractions of diaphragm muscle from genetically myotonic mice  <cit> . diaphragm from these mice had lesser degrees of myotonia than seen in the diaphragm of the present study. total relaxation time during a singe train contraction ranged from ~ <dig>  to  <dig>  seconds in contrast to values exceeding  <dig> seconds with 9-ac in the present study. in the genetically myotonic mice, repetitive train stimulation at a frequency of  <dig> hz resulted in a rapid reduction in relaxation time over the course of  <dig> seconds, with minimal changes thereafter during the subsequent  <dig> seconds.

the present study expands on our previous findings  <cit>  in several manners. we found that the reduction of myotonia during fatigue-inducing contractions occurs during isometric as well as isotonic contractions, and in the drug-induced myotonia model as well as genetic myotonia. furthermore, the present study indicates that the resolution of myotonia varies as a function of the frequency of muscle stimulation. in addition the extent of drug-induced myotonia differed among the three muscles studied, with the slow fiber type predominance of the soleus appearing to have had a protective effect. finally, the present data indicate that the time course of the warm-up phenomenon is much faster than that of force loss during fatigue-inducing contractions.

one of the limitations of the present study is that the studies were done in vitro, under conditions in which there is no blood flow and thus no delivery of nutrients and/or impaired removal of potentially adverse metabolites. thus the development of fatigue may have occurred faster in the drug-induced myotonia model than would occur in vivo in humans or animals with genetic clc- <dig> chloride channel deficient myotonia. a second limitation is that the genetic muscle diseases that cause myotonia are a heterogeneous group which include not only two variants of clc- <dig> deficient myotonia but also myotonic dystrophy. several of these disorders have features in addition to the myotonia, which for some includes muscle weakness. among these additional features, muscle weakness in particular may impact the rate at which fatigue develops, thereby changing the temporal relationship between the improvement of the myotonia and the reduction of force in response to repetitive vigorous contractions.

CONCLUSIONS
fatigue-inducing contractions were shown to dissipate the amount of mechanical myotonia induced by the chloride channel blocker 9-ac. however the rate at which this occurred was considerably faster than the drop in force over time, consistent with different mechanisms accounting for the warm up phenomenon and the production of fatigue. from a clinical perspective this suggests that subjects with myotonia need not warm up to a sufficiently large extent to produce muscle fatigue in order for the myotonia to dissipate, but nonetheless suggest a role for vigorous rather than more modest contractions as a means for resolving the muscle myotonia more quickly.

"BACKGROUND
snake venom is a mixture of proteins and polypeptides which can be divided into enzymatic and non-enzymatic families  <cit> .
three-finger toxins are non-enzymatic polypeptides which belong to a well characterized superfamily of snake venom toxins.
structurally they have similar folds, with three β-sheeted loops  that are stabilized by 4– <dig> disulfide bridges present in the central core  <cit> .
despite their structural similarity, they differ widely in their molecular targets.
for example, members of this family target various receptor/ion channel proteins such as α1-nachrs, l-type calcium channels and integrin αiibβ <dig> .
such a wide diversity in their molecular targets is due to changes in their primary sequences, while keeping the basic molecular scaffold intact.
analysis of amino acid sequences and gene structures will help elucidate the molecular evolution of these functionally important toxins.
*nachr, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
as with other snake venom proteins  <cit> , three-finger toxins are also encoded by a multigene family  <cit>  and contain functionally diversified isoforms.
these venom protein families have evolved through a process of gene duplication followed by accelerated point mutations in the protein coding region  <cit> .
for example, in phospholipase a <dig> genes, the dn/ds ratio in the coding regions is higher than in the non-coding regions  <cit> .
such adaptive darwinian evolution plays an important role in the evolution of novel gene functions, leading to functional diversity in each superfamily of toxins.
the accelerated rate of mutations in venom proteins likely provides a competitive edge in predator-prey interactions  <cit> .
until recently, three-finger toxins were thought to be present only in venoms of the snake families elapidae  <cit> .
however, we and others have demonstrated their presence in the venoms of colubrid and viperid snakes  <cit> .
recently we constructed a cdna library from the venom glands of sistrurus catenatus edwardsii  and identified a three-finger toxin family  in the venom gland transcriptome  <cit> .
as three-finger toxins are uncommon in viperid venoms, we performed rt-pcr using a separate pool of rna as template and found five transcripts that encode three-finger toxins  <cit> .
they have a  <dig> residue signal peptide followed by a mature protein consisting of 64– <dig> residues, and the ten conserved cysteine residues, which form five disulfide bridges characteristic of most three-finger toxins, are also present.
these viperid toxins belong to the non-conventional three-finger toxin subfamily that has the fifth disulfide bridge in the first loop  <cit> , and they were named 3ftx  <dig> through 3ftx  <dig>  3ftx  <dig> and  <dig> differ only in one residue in the mature protein, whereas all others are distinct isoforms.
all of them have nearly identical signal peptide sequences, but the sequence identity in the mature protein region is often low  with the exception of 3ftx  <dig> and  <dig>  .
a systematic comparison of amino acid sequences of the mature proteins indicate that some segments are highly conserved  between two or three isoforms, whereas other regions are not  .
such similarities and dissimilarities in various other segments were observed among these three-finger toxins and they appear to be evolving through ""switching"" of various segments.
to understand the molecular evolution of these toxins, we obtained the gene sequences of these three-finger toxins using genomic dna  pcr and genomewalking approaches.
this is the first report of gene structure of three-finger toxins from snakes of the family viperidae.
the analyses of their gene sequences show that segment ""switching"" occurs only in the exons, not in the introns.
this phenomenon of exchange is likely an important contributor to the gene evolution of this family of toxins which exhibit numerous distinct pharmacological effects.
RESULTS
gene structure
to understand the evolution of the three-finger toxins in s. catenatus edwardsii venom, we determined their gene structures .
we obtained the full length gene of 3ftx  <dig> by gdna pcr.
however, we obtained only partial genes  of the other four toxins by gdna pcr even after several attempts, perhaps due to suboptimal annealing of the primers or the thermal cycling profile.
we performed genomewalking to obtain the remaining gene segments from exon i to exon ii .
at least  <dig> clones were sequenced from each pcr product to obtain the gene sequences of all five three-finger toxins .
the cdna sequences were used to determine the exon-intron boundaries , which follow the gt-ag rule of splice-donor and -acceptor sites  <cit> .
genes of all five three-finger toxins have similar architecture, with two introns and three exons, similar to those of elapid three-finger toxin genes.
sequence data was deposited in genbank under accession numbers eu  <dig>  eu  <dig>  eu  <dig>  eu  <dig> and eu  <dig>  respectively.
the gene sequences were used to determine the phylogenetic relationship with three-finger toxin genes from the snake families elapidae and colubridae.
the phylogenetic tree was constructed using dnaman, and viperid three-finger toxin genes form a separate cluster in the tree .
intron i
intron i plays an important role in the expression of various genes  <cit>  and is the most variable region in elapid three-finger toxin genes  <cit> .
sequence alignment of intron i of the viperid genes revealed that it can be divided into segments similar to elapid three-finger toxin genes  <cit> .
segments i, ii, v, vii and x are conserved in all the genes except erabutoxin c gene .
in 3ftx  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  segments iii and iv are missing.
new additional segments iiia, va and vc are present in 3ftx  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  3ftx  <dig> has an insertion , whereas 3ftx  <dig> has one additional segment identified as vd .
interestingly, the additional segments in viperid three-finger gene are short or long nucleotide repeats.
segment va in 3ftx  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> has 19– <dig> continuous ""taa"" repeats, while the vb in 3ftx  <dig> has  <dig> continuous ""gat"" repeats.
these shorter repeats may represent microsatellite sequences.
the segment vd in 3ftx  <dig> has three different repeats: two repeats of tatttcattccattccatattttcgattctattcctgttctg , three repeats of tctattctattccactcc sequences  and  <dig> and  <dig> continuous repeats of ctatt  .
addition/deletion of segments in intron i is also observed in elapid and hydrophiid genes and was linked to the evolutionary diversification of these snake toxin genes  <cit> .
intron i of all viperid three-finger genes are nearly identical; among 3ftx  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> there is only a short insertion  in 3ftx  <dig>  3ftx  <dig> is distinct from other 3ftxs.
it has two additional segments  and segment iiia is missing .
the additional segments are either deleted  or added  in the gene of three-finger toxins during their evolution, but the role of these insertions/deletions in the expression of the three-finger toxins is currently unknown.
interestingly, the region of exon-intron boundary is similar to elapid and hydrophiid genes and seems to be conserved among all of them.
intron ii
intron ii of the elapid and hydrophiid three-finger toxin genes is conserved and was thought to be not segmented  <cit> .
however, comparison of the intron ii sequences of viperid genes reveals that it also can be divided into segments, similar to intron i .
segments i, iii and v are conserved in all three-finger genes.
however, 3ftx  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes have an additional common segment , and 3ftx  <dig> has one additional segments .
thus, segmentation appears to be a common structural feature of both introns, and the insertion/deletion of segments may contribute to their regulation of expression.
further, analysis of segments may facilitate understanding the evolutionary history of this unusual gene structural feature.
segment switching in exons
exons also appeared to have segments .
as expected because of overall size, the segments in exons are much smaller as compared to those in introns .
analysis of the gene sequences reveals that the gain/loss of segments occurs in both introns and exons .
the segments in introns, when present, show high similarities .
in contrast, while some exon segments show high sequence identity , other segments show low identity .
such similarity/dissimilarity of segments is more prominent in exon ii and exon iii.
in exon ii, there are four different kinds of segment ii; in 3ftx  <dig> and  <dig> they are identical, whereas in the other genes they are totally different .
in the same way, segment v is similar in 3ftx  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  whereas in 3ftx  <dig> and  <dig> it is different.
segment vi is absent in 3ftx  <dig> but present in the other genes; this segment is similar in 3ftx  <dig> and  <dig> but different in 3ftx  <dig> and  <dig>  thus exon ii appears to have evolved through ""switching"" of segments, although the origins of the ""new"" segments are not known.
similarly, exon iii also appears to have evolved through ""switching"" of segments.
however, this phenomenon is not observed in introns of these genes, although there are additions/deletions of a few short segments in introns .
the switching of segments in exons has far reaching effects on the biological effects of the toxins.
the changed segments will affect the overall surface properties of the expressed protein  and hence the function.
in contrast, the small additions/deletions in introns will not affect the nature of the protein product, but may affect its expression.
it is important to note that in spite of this segment switching, positions of cysteine residues are conserved, thereby maintaining similar disulfide pairing, folding architecture and the overall three-finger fold of the mature protein.
there are several possibilities that could explain the observed switching of segments.
<dig>  splicing variations: the difference in isoforms of some proteins due to change of segments can be easily explained based on splicing variation  <cit> .
however, unlike these proteins, the segment switching in viperid 3ftx occurs within exon ii and exon iii.
among three-finger toxins, long-chain neurotoxins arose from short-chain neurotoxins through an error in the splicing site  <cit> .
such an error leads to insertion of a short segment with the fifth disulfide in the second loop.
in viperid toxin genes, however, the insertions of segments do not occur at the intron-exon boundaries, so the mechanism of insertions/deletions or switching of segments does not occur due to errors in splicing.
<dig>  recombination: distinct genes encoding isoforms of proteins are also generated through recombination of two related/unrelated genes  <cit> .
in general, the segments involved in such recombination events are fairly large , and the segments that are exchanged in exons of 3ftxs are probably much too small.
therefore, canonical recombination may not be involved in these exchange events.
<dig>  accumulation of point mutations: accelerated point mutations in three-finger toxins are common and they lead to the evolution of several isoforms  <cit> .
although these point mutations occur in exon segments, they may not explain such a distinct change in the sequences of segments.
this possibility requires the repeated occurrence and accumulation of multiple point mutations within each segment.
further, all the intermediates have to be selected through evolution.
the absence of intermediate isoforms, however, contradicts this possibility; and
<dig>  independent recruitment events: venom protein genes are thought to be recruited to the venom gland genome by gene duplication of a normal physiologically important gene and recruitment of the duplicated gene for expression in the venom gland  <cit> .
it is possible, but not probable, that each of these isoforms has an independent origin and their ancestral three-finger toxin genes were recruited at different times.
high similarity across numerous 3ftx genes in exon i, and introns i and ii, supports instead a single recruitment and lineage of these genes and not multiple recruitment events.
in the unlikely events of independent recruitments, introns will have to undergo convergent evolution to explain the high similarity while the exons will be undergoing divergent evolution.
therefore, segment switching results in divergence of functional regions of exons  while maintaining the basic fold, rather than convergence upon a single scaffold motif during independent recruitment.
although the mechanism of the exchange of segments in exons is unknown, it is apparent that these events play important roles in the evolution of these toxins, in addition to the role that accelerated point mutations in the exons plays in toxin evolution  <cit> .
these point mutations appear to alter the interaction surfaces of toxins  <cit> .
however, they affect one residue at a time and a smaller molecular surface, and they may help in fine-tuning of functional sites of the molecule for interaction with specific molecular targets.
they may  enhance the affinity to a specific receptor or ion channel;  change the specificity to another closely related receptor or ion channel; and  change the species specificity of the toxin to a particular receptor.
in contrast, accelerated exchange of larger segments drastically changes parts of the interacting loops or toxin surface.
therefore, these exchanges of segments may help in switching the molecular targets of toxins and hence affecting their pharmacological properties.
we propose that accelerated segment switch in exons to alter targeting  is a phenomenon which plays an important role in ""remodeling"" a toxin toward a different and novel receptor target .
asset and evolution of molecular surfaces
to understand the impact of switching of segments on the molecular surfaces of three-finger toxins in s. catenatus edwardsii, we modeled all four distinct three-finger toxins.
as shown in figure  <dig>  the three β-sheeted loops in these toxins are distinctly different from one another, as most of them are replaced by segment switching .
further, the electrostatic potentials of these toxins indicate that the charge distributions on their molecular surfaces are also different.
3ftx  <dig> and  <dig> have more acidic residues on the surface as compared to 3ftx  <dig> and  <dig> .
this drastic difference in the charge residues on the surface is due to the exchange of segments , but retention of the similar molecular fold.
such a change in the charged residues might play an important role in switching the molecular targets.
since most of the functional sites are located on these β-sheeted loops , it is logical to propose that all of these novel viperid toxins have distinct pharmacological properties.
therefore, asset phenomena affect the molecular surfaces of three-finger toxins significantly and alter their molecular targets, playing a crucial role in the evolution of the three-finger toxins.
CONCLUSIONS
systematic analyses of gene sequences of sistrurus catenatus edwardsii  three-finger toxins indicate that short segments in exons ii and iii are changed more rapidly compared to intron segments.
we propose that such a phenomenon  of accelerated segment switching in exons has the effect of rapidly altering the molecular surface properties.
this mechanism of rapid change can provide a selective advantage to venomous snakes in predator/prey coevolutionary arms races, resulting in a diversity of structurally similar toxins in a single venom and allowing the venom toxins repertoire to stay a step ahead of prey defensive responses  <cit> .
thus asset plays an important role in changing the molecular target and hence the pharmacology of these toxins.

exons also appeared to have segments . as expected because of overall size, the segments in exons are much smaller as compared to those in introns . analysis of the gene sequences reveals that the gain/loss of segments occurs in both introns and exons . the segments in introns, when present, show high similarities . in contrast, while some exon segments show high sequence identity , other segments show low identity . such similarity/dissimilarity of segments is more prominent in exon ii and exon iii. in exon ii, there are four different kinds of segment ii; in 3ftx  <dig> and  <dig> they are identical, whereas in the other genes they are totally different . in the same way, segment v is similar in 3ftx  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  whereas in 3ftx  <dig> and  <dig> it is different. segment vi is absent in 3ftx  <dig> but present in the other genes; this segment is similar in 3ftx  <dig> and  <dig> but different in 3ftx  <dig> and  <dig>  thus exon ii appears to have evolved through ""switching"" of segments, although the origins of the ""new"" segments are not known. similarly, exon iii also appears to have evolved through ""switching"" of segments. however, this phenomenon is not observed in introns of these genes, although there are additions/deletions of a few short segments in introns . the switching of segments in exons has far reaching effects on the biological effects of the toxins. the changed segments will affect the overall surface properties of the expressed protein  and hence the function. in contrast, the small additions/deletions in introns will not affect the nature of the protein product, but may affect its expression. it is important to note that in spite of this segment switching, positions of cysteine residues are conserved, thereby maintaining similar disulfide pairing, folding architecture and the overall three-finger fold of the mature protein.

there are several possibilities that could explain the observed switching of segments.

 <dig>  splicing variations: the difference in isoforms of some proteins due to change of segments can be easily explained based on splicing variation  <cit> . however, unlike these proteins, the segment switching in viperid 3ftx occurs within exon ii and exon iii. among three-finger toxins, long-chain neurotoxins arose from short-chain neurotoxins through an error in the splicing site  <cit> . such an error leads to insertion of a short segment with the fifth disulfide in the second loop. in viperid toxin genes, however, the insertions of segments do not occur at the intron-exon boundaries, so the mechanism of insertions/deletions or switching of segments does not occur due to errors in splicing.

 <dig>  recombination: distinct genes encoding isoforms of proteins are also generated through recombination of two related/unrelated genes  <cit> . in general, the segments involved in such recombination events are fairly large , and the segments that are exchanged in exons of 3ftxs are probably much too small. therefore, canonical recombination may not be involved in these exchange events.

 <dig>  accumulation of point mutations: accelerated point mutations in three-finger toxins are common and they lead to the evolution of several isoforms  <cit> . although these point mutations occur in exon segments, they may not explain such a distinct change in the sequences of segments. this possibility requires the repeated occurrence and accumulation of multiple point mutations within each segment. further, all the intermediates have to be selected through evolution. the absence of intermediate isoforms, however, contradicts this possibility; and

 <dig>  independent recruitment events: venom protein genes are thought to be recruited to the venom gland genome by gene duplication of a normal physiologically important gene and recruitment of the duplicated gene for expression in the venom gland  <cit> . it is possible, but not probable, that each of these isoforms has an independent origin and their ancestral three-finger toxin genes were recruited at different times. high similarity across numerous 3ftx genes in exon i, and introns i and ii, supports instead a single recruitment and lineage of these genes and not multiple recruitment events. in the unlikely events of independent recruitments, introns will have to undergo convergent evolution to explain the high similarity while the exons will be undergoing divergent evolution. therefore, segment switching results in divergence of functional regions of exons  while maintaining the basic fold, rather than convergence upon a single scaffold motif during independent recruitment.

although the mechanism of the exchange of segments in exons is unknown, it is apparent that these events play important roles in the evolution of these toxins, in addition to the role that accelerated point mutations in the exons plays in toxin evolution  <cit> . these point mutations appear to alter the interaction surfaces of toxins  <cit> . however, they affect one residue at a time and a smaller molecular surface, and they may help in fine-tuning of functional sites of the molecule for interaction with specific molecular targets. they may  enhance the affinity to a specific receptor or ion channel;  change the specificity to another closely related receptor or ion channel; and  change the species specificity of the toxin to a particular receptor. in contrast, accelerated exchange of larger segments drastically changes parts of the interacting loops or toxin surface. therefore, these exchanges of segments may help in switching the molecular targets of toxins and hence affecting their pharmacological properties. we propose that accelerated segment switch in exons to alter targeting  is a phenomenon which plays an important role in ""remodeling"" a toxin toward a different and novel receptor target .

asset and evolution of molecular surfaces
to understand the impact of switching of segments on the molecular surfaces of three-finger toxins in s. catenatus edwardsii, we modeled all four distinct three-finger toxins. as shown in figure  <dig>  the three β-sheeted loops in these toxins are distinctly different from one another, as most of them are replaced by segment switching . further, the electrostatic potentials of these toxins indicate that the charge distributions on their molecular surfaces are also different. 3ftx  <dig> and  <dig> have more acidic residues on the surface as compared to 3ftx  <dig> and  <dig> . this drastic difference in the charge residues on the surface is due to the exchange of segments , but retention of the similar molecular fold. such a change in the charged residues might play an important role in switching the molecular targets. since most of the functional sites are located on these β-sheeted loops , it is logical to propose that all of these novel viperid toxins have distinct pharmacological properties. therefore, asset phenomena affect the molecular surfaces of three-finger toxins significantly and alter their molecular targets, playing a crucial role in the evolution of the three-finger toxins.

CONCLUSIONS
systematic analyses of gene sequences of sistrurus catenatus edwardsii  three-finger toxins indicate that short segments in exons ii and iii are changed more rapidly compared to intron segments. we propose that such a phenomenon  of accelerated segment switching in exons has the effect of rapidly altering the molecular surface properties. this mechanism of rapid change can provide a selective advantage to venomous snakes in predator/prey coevolutionary arms races, resulting in a diversity of structurally similar toxins in a single venom and allowing the venom toxins repertoire to stay a step ahead of prey defensive responses  <cit> . thus asset plays an important role in changing the molecular target and hence the pharmacology of these toxins.

","thus the phenomenon of accelerated segment switch in exons to alter targeting  may play an important role in the evolution of three-finger toxins, resulting in a family of toxins with a highly conserved structural fold but widely varying biological activities.
such a ""switching"" of segments in exons may result in drastically altering the molecular surface topology and charge, and hence the molecular targets of these three-finger toxins.
here we report five gene structures of three-finger toxins from a viperid snake, sistrurus catenatus edwardsii.
venom proteins are encoded by multigene families that have evolved through a process of gene duplication followed by accelerated evolution in the protein coding region.
these toxin genes are structured similarly to elapid and hydrophiid three-finger toxin genes, with two introns and three exons.
both introns and exons show distinct patterns of segmentation, and the insertion/deletion of segments may define their evolutionary history.
","BACKGROUND
snake venoms consist primarily of proteins and peptides showing a myriad of potent biological activities which have been shaped by both adaptive and neutral selective forces. venom proteins are encoded by multigene families that have evolved through a process of gene duplication followed by accelerated evolution in the protein coding region.


RESULTS
here we report five gene structures of three-finger toxins from a viperid snake, sistrurus catenatus edwardsii. these toxin genes are structured similarly to elapid and hydrophiid three-finger toxin genes, with two introns and three exons. both introns and exons show distinct patterns of segmentation, and the insertion/deletion of segments may define their evolutionary history. the segments in introns, when present, are highly similar to their corresponding segments in other members of the gene family. in contrast, some segments in the exons show high similarity, while others are often distinctly different among corresponding regions of the isoforms.


CONCLUSIONS
ordered, conserved exon structure strongly suggests that segments in corresponding regions in exons have been exchanged with distinctly different ones during the evolution of these genes. such a ""switching"" of segments in exons may result in drastically altering the molecular surface topology and charge, and hence the molecular targets of these three-finger toxins. thus the phenomenon of accelerated segment switch in exons to alter targeting  may play an important role in the evolution of three-finger toxins, resulting in a family of toxins with a highly conserved structural fold but widely varying biological activities.

"BACKGROUND
the intricate details of regulated gene expression are not well-characterized in the human genome.
currently our understanding relies greatly on our ability to experimentally identify prospective regulatory regions and to computationally evaluate features of those experimental datasets.
we have found that searching for genes arranged in a ‘head-to-head’ configuration can precisely identify a set of candidate regulatory regions, without the intermediate step of experimental identification.
the designation of the 5′ and 3′ ends of a gene  indicates that a head-to-head arrangement places the transcription start sites  of two genes in close proximity.
the directionality of transcription  by rna polymerase allows these adjacent genes to produce products without interfering with each other.
two genes in a head-to-head configuration that have their 5′ ends located fairly close together, within  <dig> base pairs, are assumed to have a shared promoter region located between the two 5′ ends.
this promoter is defined as a bidirectional promoter, because it influences expression of the two genes simultaneously.
this influence can be concordant or discordant.
bidirectional promoters occur frequently in the human genome  <cit> .
despite their prevalence, their full biological significance is not yet known.
nevertheless, evidence of significant biological implications is emerging  <cit> .
further elucidation may come from studies in other species' genomes.
the process of mapping bidirectional promoters in other species is fairly simple once the algorithms are developed.
more importantly, a comprehensive set of these regulators in multiple species allows comparative analyses across species.
predictions made within a single species can be validated by their appearance in another.
bidirectional promoters represent a special class of promoter sequences, specifically those having an exon on either side of the promoter region .
thus, the promoter region is ‘bounded’ by sequences with described functions on both sides, and thereby limited to the intervening portion.
this arrangement solves the problem of defining the upstream boundary of the promoter, which is a troublesome reality of studying promoters with no discernible upstream endpoints.
if fundamental differences are present in the sequences underlying functional elements, machine-learning approaches may be able to identify them.
the key to success lies in a precise description of each of the functional categories.
for instance, sequences characterizing bidirectional promoters can be compared to non-promoter regions found between the ‘tails’ of adjacent genes arranged in a tail-to-tail configuration.
additionally, further characterization may be possible by discriminating bidirectional promoter sequences from enhancer regions, which are often highly conserved and can act at extreme distances from a responsive gene.
the most challenging regions to distinguish from bidirectional promoters are other promoter regions, including unidirectional promoters that have a neighboring gene  and unbounded promoters, which have no upstream neighboring gene.
progress in discerning classes of functional elements from each other, without the aid of experimental data, represents a significant goal in our ability to decode the human genome.
in this manuscript, we present a detailed mapping of bidirectional promoters in the mouse genome, analogous to our work in the human genome  <cit> .
furthermore, we compare data from human and mouse as a means to validate our predictions, and to further characterize features within bidirectional promoters.
using bidirectional promoters as a model dataset, we describe results of machine learning approaches to score functional elements in genomic sequences.
we conclude with a multiple class predictor that aims to accurately discriminate classes of promoters from one another, from enhancers, and from nonfunctional regions.
RESULTS
mapping bidirectional promoters in the mouse genome
in an analogous approach to our studies in the human genome, we systematically mapped bidirectional promoters in the mouse genome.
these promoters were defined by their position between two oppositely-oriented transcription units, whose transcription start sites  were no more than  <dig> bp apart.
all transcripts used in the analysis originated at one of three repositories :
• the ucsc list of known genes  <cit> .
• genbank mrna data  <cit> .
• spliced est data from the genbank dbest database  <cit> .
as discussed in  <cit>  the procedure for mapping bidirectional promoters from the known gene annotations is quite straightforward due to the quality of these gene descriptions.
initially, all genes are represented as clusters containing overlapping transcripts.
each cluster extends from the farthest 5′ to the farthest 3′ coordinate of any included transcript.
neighboring clusters are then examined with respect to the distance and orientation of their 5′ ends.
if the 5′ ends of two genes are no more than  <dig> bp apart and the genes are transcribed in opposite directions, the region between them is considered to be a bidirectional promoter.
identifying bidirectional promoters from other annotation sources in the mouse genome can be more complex due to the diversity and fragmented nature of the current transcripts.
for instance, both the spliced ests and the genbank mrna transcripts contain multiple overlapping segments of transcribed regions, which are frequently updated as new information becomes available.
to handle the complexity of the data in the spliced ests, we applied an algorithm to extract the bidirectional promoters that passed a variety of conditional tests.
these included conformity to the rules of distance and orientation.
furthermore, transcripts were classified as intergenic or intragenic by comparison with the known genes as a reference track.
additional criteria requiring majority agreement with the orientation of co-localized ests and with the orientation of known genes are described in yang and elnitski   <cit> .
the mapping algorithm identified  <dig>  candidate bidirectional promoter regions in the mouse genome.
this number is similar to the number of candidate bidirectional promoters identified in the human genome using a similar strategy  <cit> .
in both genomes, the number of bidirectional promoters was larger than previously reported  <cit> , as a result of updated gene annotations and the use of spliced est data.
the validity of these candidate regions was assessed by comparison to the riken cage dataset  <cit> .
the cage technique captures the true 5′ ends of transcripts, allowing a direct comparison to our bidirectional promoters by their coordinates in the mouse genome.
figure  <dig> shows bidirectional promoters that are fully validated when a cage transcript flanks both sides of the promoter region.
in the human genome, bidirectional promoters from the known gene, mrna, and est data are validated at 96%, 78%, and 81%, respectively , while in the mouse genome, bidirectional promoters from the known gene, mrna, and est data are validated at 95%, 40%, and 65%, respectively .
the low validation score for mouse mrna appears to reflect an incomplete description of the mouse genes in the mouse genome assembly mm <dig> .
comparison of human and mouse bidirectional promoter sets
bidirectional promoters are ancient features, exhibiting orthology from human to fugu rubripes <cit> .
to compare the co-occurrence of bidirectional promoters in the human and mouse genomes, we mapped human genes regulated by bidirectional promoters to the mouse genome and assessed whether the corresponding mouse gene also formed a bidirectional promoter with its 5′ neighbor.
of  <dig> known genes, as shown in figure  <dig>  41% were associated with bidirectional promoters in the mouse genome by the same gene name.
an additional 4% were added from genbank mrna and 7% from the spliced ests.
roughly 7% of the set had a gene in the mouse genome but shows no evidence of a bidirectional promoter.
the remaining 40% could not be mapped to the mouse using this method.
table  <dig> shows the orthologous pairs of mouse genes corresponding to ten human genes involved in cancer that have bidirectional promoters.
from this data we predict that  <dig> mouse genes will be positioned closer together than they currently appear.
brca <dig>  erbb <dig>  fanca and fancf are much farther apart in mouse than in human.
table  <dig> shows the go terms for genes that are regulated by bidirectional promoters in human, but not in mouse, implying that regulatory changes could change the expression of these genes between species.
it should be noted that strategies such as ours to map orthologs by gene name provide high confidence assignments, but underestimate the number of orthologous bidirectional promoters in the human and mouse genomes.
we have further proven this point by mapping orthologous gene pairs regulated by bidirectional promoters in twelve species using rigorous genomic alignment information  <cit> .
although bidirectional promoters are orthologous between humans and mice, they exhibit sparse conservation signals in multi-species alignments.
this is a slightly surprising result, given that sequence conservation is a reliable marker for functional elements.
nevertheless, it is possible that alternative methods may reveal similarities in bidirectional promoters across species.
to test for similarity in sequence characteristics that may reveal subtle similarities between the sets of human and mouse bidirectional promoters, we calculated a log-likelihood score called regulatory potential .
the rp score was used in esperr   <cit>  to capture information in sequence alignments over seven vertebrate species.
this method has been shown to discriminate regulatory regions from nonfunctional regions with an accuracy of 80%  <cit> .
the rp score cumulative distribution functions plotted in figure  <dig> reveal that regulatory potential scores are similar for bidirectional promoters defined by known genes, ests, and mrna in both human and mouse.
the similarity in profiles exhibited by all three datasets for each species indicates that sequence characteristics are similar in bidirectional promoter regions, both across species  and across datasets .
the strategy used to map these gene pairs across species strongly identifies orthologous genes that are characterized by name.
therefore the conclusions should not change as more data is added.
discriminating functional elements based on rp scores
having established the orthology of bidirectional promoters between human and mouse, we now shift our attention to the problem of discriminating functional elements in the human genome.
we again make use of rp scores, which have proven useful for discriminating functional elements from nonfunctional elements, yet their ability to discriminate among types of functional elements remains unknown.
to test the hypothesis that sequence characteristics differ between classes of functional elements, thereby allowing these classes to be discriminated, we compared rp scores for human bidirectional promoters to those for other functional regions, including enhancers, unidirectional promoters, unbounded promoters, non-promoters , coding regions, and neutral regions.
the cumulative distribution functions of rp score for the different functional classes are shown in figure  <dig>  we observe that:
• as expected, neutral regions  separated very distinctly from functional regions such as enhancers.
• despite the fact that bidirectional promoters do not have a strong signal for sequence conservation, they have slightly higher rp scores than enhancers.
this is significant because the enhancers used in this analysis are enhancers of genes involved in essential developmental processes, such as neurogenesis  <cit> , which are characterized by strong signals of sequence conservation known as multi-species conserved sequences   <cit> .
• bidirectional promoters have high rp scores, similar to unidirectional promoters, which are promoter regions that are defined by two genes in a head-to-tail configuration.
like bidirectional promoters, unidirectional promoters are bounded on both sides by exons.
• high scores are not a feature of all promoter regions.
for example, unbounded promoters, which are promoters having no neighboring upstream gene, tend not to have high rp scores.
we examined unbounded promoter regions with no upstream gene within  <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig>  bp and found moderately low rp scores for all three classes.
furthermore, the range of these scores was indistinguishable from non-promoter regions.
• coding regions score nearly as well as bidirectional promoters.
this suggests that the types of nucleotide substitutions and the “word” content of bidirectional promoters and coding regions may be governed by the same rules, despite that fact that coding regions are strongly conserved and bidirectional promoters are not.
prediction of bidirectional promoters from rp scores
on the basis of figure  <dig>  it is apparent that bidirectional promoter regions tend to have higher rp scores than either non-promoter or unbounded promoter regions.
another way to see this is to plot the class-conditional density functions p, where x is the rp score, and c is a functional class; this is simply the probability density function of rp scores, restricted to the functional class c. given the class-conditional density functions p and p for classes c <dig> and c <dig>  respectively, we can construct a likelihood ratio classifier that maps an rp score x to a functional class using the rule:
if pp {> μ decide class c1< μ decide class c <dig>
the performance of this classifier for different values of the threshold μ is summarized by a receiver operating characteristic , which is a plot of sensitivity against .
we constructed two such classifiers: one to discriminate bidirectional promoters from non-promoters, and the other to discriminate bidirectional promoters from unbounded promoters.
distinguishing bidirectional promoters from non-promoters
we constructed a likelihood-based classifier to distinguish bidirectional promoters from non-promoters; this is a two-class classification problem, in which the two classes are:
c1= {bidirectional promoters}c2 = {non-promoters}
the class-conditional probability distributions p and p are shown in figure  <dig> .
the corresponding roc curve is shown in figure  <dig>  a maximum likelihood classification rule ) yielded a test set accuracy of 74%, a specificity of 92% , and a sensitivity of 65% , as shown in table  <dig>  the roc curve reveals that the sensitivity can be boosted above 80% by trading off for a specificity below 80%.
distinguishing bidirectional from unbounded promoters
we constructed a likelihood-based classifier to distinguish bidirectional promoters from unbounded promoters ; this is a two-class classification problem, in which the two classes are:
c1 = {bidirectional promoters}c2 = {unbounded promoters }
the class-conditional probability distributions p and p are shown in figure  <dig> .
the corresponding roc curve is shown in figure  <dig>  a maximum likelihood classification rule ) yielded a test set accuracy of 80%, a specificity of 81% , and a sensitivity of 67% , as shown in table  <dig>  the roc curve reveals that the sensitivity can be boosted above 80% by trading off for a specificity below 75%.
multiple class prediction
we then tackled a more challenging problem—to construct a classifier that distinguishes the following four classes:
c1={bidirectional promoters}c2={unbounded promoters }c3={enhancers}c4={non-promoters}
it turns out that bidirectional promoters and unbounded promoters are enriched in cpg islands, while enhancers and non-promoters are depleted in cpg islands.
furthermore, bidirectional promoters and enhancers tend to have relatively high rp scores as compared to unbounded promoters and non-promoters.
it follows that by making use of both features , we may be able to separate the four classes.
we therefore implemented a two-stage hierarchical classifier .
the first stage only looks at the cpg island feature: if cpg islands are present, the instance is passed to the left child at level  <dig> , while if cpg islands are not present, the instance is passed to the right child at level  <dig> .
there is also a classification outcome z <dig> of the first stage; if the instance was passed to the left child, then z <dig> =  <dig>  else z <dig> =  <dig>  ideally, instances that end up in node n <dig> should be either bidirectional or unbounded promoters, while instances that end up in node n <dig> should be either enhancers or non-promoters.
the next stage of the classifier then refines the classification further.
node n <dig> uses a support vector machine to separate bidirectional from unbounded promoters based on two features—the presence of cpg islands and rp score, while node n <dig> uses a decision tree to separate enhancers from non-promoters based on one feature—rp score .
a decision tree was used at node n <dig> because it gave better results that a support vector machine.
there is a classification outcome z <dig> associated to each node at level  <dig>  for node n <dig>  z <dig> =  <dig> implies that the instance is classified as a bidirectional promoter, while z <dig> =  <dig> implies that the instance is classified as an unbounded promoter.
for node n <dig>  z <dig> =  <dig> implies that the instance is classified as an enhancer, while z <dig> =  <dig> implies that the instance is classified as a non-promoter.
the overall classification is then given by the pair  as follows:
CONCLUSIONS
bidirectional promoters aid in the analysis of promoter regions, as they are bounded on both sides by other functional elements, and thus precisely delineate the promoter region.
moreover, despite a lack of strong sequence conservation, bidirectional promoters exhibit conserved structure across species, which will undoubtedly be helpful in tracing evolutionary and species-specific events.
predictive approaches to classifying functional elements in the human genome are frequently based on a variety of experimental characteristics .
here we have demonstrated that machine learning approaches can be effective without experimental data; this is the first evidence that different types of promoters can be discriminated from one another through machine learning approaches.

although bidirectional promoters are orthologous between humans and mice, they exhibit sparse conservation signals in multi-species alignments. this is a slightly surprising result, given that sequence conservation is a reliable marker for functional elements. nevertheless, it is possible that alternative methods may reveal similarities in bidirectional promoters across species.

to test for similarity in sequence characteristics that may reveal subtle similarities between the sets of human and mouse bidirectional promoters, we calculated a log-likelihood score called regulatory potential . the rp score was used in esperr   <cit>  to capture information in sequence alignments over seven vertebrate species. this method has been shown to discriminate regulatory regions from nonfunctional regions with an accuracy of 80%  <cit> .

the rp score cumulative distribution functions plotted in figure  <dig> reveal that regulatory potential scores are similar for bidirectional promoters defined by known genes, ests, and mrna in both human and mouse. the similarity in profiles exhibited by all three datasets for each species indicates that sequence characteristics are similar in bidirectional promoter regions, both across species  and across datasets . the strategy used to map these gene pairs across species strongly identifies orthologous genes that are characterized by name. therefore the conclusions should not change as more data is added.

discriminating functional elements based on rp scores
having established the orthology of bidirectional promoters between human and mouse, we now shift our attention to the problem of discriminating functional elements in the human genome. we again make use of rp scores, which have proven useful for discriminating functional elements from nonfunctional elements, yet their ability to discriminate among types of functional elements remains unknown.

to test the hypothesis that sequence characteristics differ between classes of functional elements, thereby allowing these classes to be discriminated, we compared rp scores for human bidirectional promoters to those for other functional regions, including enhancers, unidirectional promoters, unbounded promoters, non-promoters , coding regions, and neutral regions.

the cumulative distribution functions of rp score for the different functional classes are shown in figure  <dig>  we observe that:

• as expected, neutral regions  separated very distinctly from functional regions such as enhancers.

• despite the fact that bidirectional promoters do not have a strong signal for sequence conservation, they have slightly higher rp scores than enhancers. this is significant because the enhancers used in this analysis are enhancers of genes involved in essential developmental processes, such as neurogenesis  <cit> , which are characterized by strong signals of sequence conservation known as multi-species conserved sequences   <cit> .

• bidirectional promoters have high rp scores, similar to unidirectional promoters, which are promoter regions that are defined by two genes in a head-to-tail configuration. like bidirectional promoters, unidirectional promoters are bounded on both sides by exons.

• high scores are not a feature of all promoter regions. for example, unbounded promoters, which are promoters having no neighboring upstream gene, tend not to have high rp scores. we examined unbounded promoter regions with no upstream gene within  <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig>  bp and found moderately low rp scores for all three classes. furthermore, the range of these scores was indistinguishable from non-promoter regions.

• coding regions score nearly as well as bidirectional promoters. this suggests that the types of nucleotide substitutions and the “word” content of bidirectional promoters and coding regions may be governed by the same rules, despite that fact that coding regions are strongly conserved and bidirectional promoters are not.

prediction of bidirectional promoters from rp scores
on the basis of figure  <dig>  it is apparent that bidirectional promoter regions tend to have higher rp scores than either non-promoter or unbounded promoter regions. another way to see this is to plot the class-conditional density functions p, where x is the rp score, and c is a functional class; this is simply the probability density function of rp scores, restricted to the functional class c. given the class-conditional density functions p and p for classes c <dig> and c <dig>  respectively, we can construct a likelihood ratio classifier that maps an rp score x to a functional class using the rule:

 if pp {> μ decide class c1< μ decide class c <dig> 

the performance of this classifier for different values of the threshold μ is summarized by a receiver operating characteristic , which is a plot of sensitivity against . we constructed two such classifiers: one to discriminate bidirectional promoters from non-promoters, and the other to discriminate bidirectional promoters from unbounded promoters.

distinguishing bidirectional promoters from non-promoters
we constructed a likelihood-based classifier to distinguish bidirectional promoters from non-promoters; this is a two-class classification problem, in which the two classes are:

 c1= {bidirectional promoters}c2 = {non-promoters} 

the class-conditional probability distributions p and p are shown in figure  <dig> . the corresponding roc curve is shown in figure  <dig>  a maximum likelihood classification rule ) yielded a test set accuracy of 74%, a specificity of 92% , and a sensitivity of 65% , as shown in table  <dig>  the roc curve reveals that the sensitivity can be boosted above 80% by trading off for a specificity below 80%.

distinguishing bidirectional from unbounded promoters
we constructed a likelihood-based classifier to distinguish bidirectional promoters from unbounded promoters ; this is a two-class classification problem, in which the two classes are:

 c1 = {bidirectional promoters}c2 = {unbounded promoters } 

the class-conditional probability distributions p and p are shown in figure  <dig> . the corresponding roc curve is shown in figure  <dig>  a maximum likelihood classification rule ) yielded a test set accuracy of 80%, a specificity of 81% , and a sensitivity of 67% , as shown in table  <dig>  the roc curve reveals that the sensitivity can be boosted above 80% by trading off for a specificity below 75%.

multiple class prediction
we then tackled a more challenging problem—to construct a classifier that distinguishes the following four classes:

 c1={bidirectional promoters}c2={unbounded promoters }c3={enhancers}c4={non-promoters} 

it turns out that bidirectional promoters and unbounded promoters are enriched in cpg islands, while enhancers and non-promoters are depleted in cpg islands. furthermore, bidirectional promoters and enhancers tend to have relatively high rp scores as compared to unbounded promoters and non-promoters. it follows that by making use of both features , we may be able to separate the four classes. we therefore implemented a two-stage hierarchical classifier . the first stage only looks at the cpg island feature: if cpg islands are present, the instance is passed to the left child at level  <dig> , while if cpg islands are not present, the instance is passed to the right child at level  <dig> . there is also a classification outcome z <dig> of the first stage; if the instance was passed to the left child, then z <dig> =  <dig>  else z <dig> =  <dig>  ideally, instances that end up in node n <dig> should be either bidirectional or unbounded promoters, while instances that end up in node n <dig> should be either enhancers or non-promoters. the next stage of the classifier then refines the classification further. node n <dig> uses a support vector machine to separate bidirectional from unbounded promoters based on two features—the presence of cpg islands and rp score, while node n <dig> uses a decision tree to separate enhancers from non-promoters based on one feature—rp score . a decision tree was used at node n <dig> because it gave better results that a support vector machine. there is a classification outcome z <dig> associated to each node at level  <dig>  for node n <dig>  z <dig> =  <dig> implies that the instance is classified as a bidirectional promoter, while z <dig> =  <dig> implies that the instance is classified as an unbounded promoter. for node n <dig>  z <dig> =  <dig> implies that the instance is classified as an enhancer, while z <dig> =  <dig> implies that the instance is classified as a non-promoter. the overall classification is then given by the pair  as follows:

CONCLUSIONS
bidirectional promoters aid in the analysis of promoter regions, as they are bounded on both sides by other functional elements, and thus precisely delineate the promoter region. moreover, despite a lack of strong sequence conservation, bidirectional promoters exhibit conserved structure across species, which will undoubtedly be helpful in tracing evolutionary and species-specific events.

predictive approaches to classifying functional elements in the human genome are frequently based on a variety of experimental characteristics . here we have demonstrated that machine learning approaches can be effective without experimental data; this is the first evidence that different types of promoters can be discriminated from one another through machine learning approaches.

","machine learning approaches are emerging as a way to discriminate various classes of functional elements.

"BACKGROUND
streptococcus suis  is an important pathogen associated with many diseases in pigs, including meningitis, septicaemia, pneumonia, endocarditis, and arthritis.
s. suis serotype  <dig>  is considered the most pathogenic as well as the most prevalent capsular type among thirty-three serotypes  in diseased pigs, and it is also the causative agent of serious infections in humans, especially in people in close contact with pig or pork byproducts  <cit> .
two recent large-scale outbreaks of human ss <dig> epidemics in china , featured clinical streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, have greatly challenged the global public health  <cit> .
recently, s. suis infection has also caused sporadic human illness in other countries, including thailand  <cit> , united kingdom  <cit> , portugal  <cit> , australia  <cit> , netherlands  <cit>  and united states  <cit> , and been recognized as the third most common cause of community acquired bacterial meningitis in hong kong and as the leading cause of adult meningitis in vietnam  <cit> .
the past pathogenesis studies were performed mainly on the pathogenic bacteria and as a result, a few virulence-associated factors have been successfully identified.
polysaccharide capsule has been considered essential for the virulence of the bacterium  <cit> , and other factors, such as suilysin, the so-called extracellular protein factor and muramidase-released protein have been shown to be linked to, but not essential for the full virulence of s. suis  <cit> .
gapdh <cit> , enolase <cit> , fbps <cit> , adhesin  <cit>  have been proved to be involved in the adherence and virulence of s. suis.
recently, serum opacity-like factor  <cit> , iga <dig> protease <cit> , d-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid  <cit>  and pgda  <cit>  were identified as important factors in s. suis virulence.
in addition, salk/salr  <cit>  and covr  <cit>  were found to affect the virulence of s. suis chinese isolates.
these studies have contributed to the understanding of s. suis pathogenesis and also suggested that host responses also play essential roles in the development of the diseases.
inducing excessive inflammation is recognized as one of the reasons why highly invasive ss <dig> strain could cause severe diseases  <cit> .
a few previous studies indicated that high level of cytokines and chemokines could be released by human brain microvascular endothelial cells  <cit> , a whole-blood culture system  <cit> , macrophages  <cit>  and monocytes  <cit>  stimulated by ss <dig>  and have important roles in the initiation and development of inflammation and meningitis  <cit> .
more direct proofs were the studies on mice with different genetic background, which indicated that il- <dig> was responsible, at least in part, for the high survival, which suggested that aberrant innate immune response contributed to ss <dig> diseases  <cit> .
to be aware of the information about host immune response would enable people to better understand the disease.
transcriptional response of alveolar macrophages to ss <dig> has been performed and the results indicated that nf-kb and map-kinases signaling pathways were induced upon interaction with ss <dig>  <cit> .
however, it is not easy to get more information since the primary macrophages are so sensitive to the interference.
spleen plays an important role in immune response and could be an ideal target to study host immune response against infection  <cit> .
in the present study, the gene expression profiles of swine spleens which suffered from highly pathogenic ss <dig>  avirulent isogenic strain and pbs respectively were investigated to reveal the host immune response to ss <dig> and the contributions of host response to ss <dig> diseases.
RESULTS
transcriptome analysis
the transcriptome analysis indicated that  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  probe sets, corresponding to  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all probe sets, were detected in wt, Δhp <dig> and mock-infected pig spleens respectively .
the expression profiles of porcine spleens challenged with wt  <dig> days post inoculation were compared with those of the mock-infected group.
after quantile normalization and statistical analysis,  <dig> transcripts were identified at the global false discovery rate  of 10% .
furthermore, the criteria of a two-fold or greater change in differential expression and a fdr of 10% were chosen to determine up-regulated and down-regulated genes in the wt infected replicates.
using these criteria,  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts, representing  <dig> and  <dig> unique genes, were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated respectively .
however, only a few genes showed significantly differential expressions when comparing Δhp <dig> with mock-infected samples .
of the  <dig> unique de transcripts,  <dig> transcripts could be determined based on blastx searches and annotated with david or by searching against the genbank database .
among these,  <dig> unique genes were grouped into  <dig> categories based on biological process gene ontology  terms or according to their potential biology process classification by referring to recent publications .
unsurprisingly, the majority of genes were related to the immune response, transcription, transport, material and energy metabolism, etc.

manual annotations were listed in italics.
many genes with multiple functions were only listed in one category according to specific biology processes.
""fc≥2"" represents up regulation , ""fc ≤  <dig> "" represents down regulation.
validation of microarray data by quantitative real-time pcr
the qpcr was performed to validate the expression patterns during infection for specific genes identified in the microarray assay.
in order to validate the differential expression of various identified genes,  <dig> up-regulated genes, with the increase ranging from  <dig> -fold to  <dig> -fold, and  <dig> down-regulated genes, with the decrease ranging from  <dig> -fold to  <dig> -fold, were selected for qpcr analysis.
all the selected down-regulated genes could be amplified from the control samples but failed to achieve significant detectable signs from wt-infected spleens, except for alox <dig> which showed  <dig> -fold down-regulated expression.
all selected up-regulated genes showed higher expression in wt-infected samples than in the control samples .
though variation in fold changes could be observed between qpcr and microarray , the differential expression patterns were coincident between the results of the two techniques, which indicated the reliability of the microarray analysis.
induction of inflammasomes and acute phase proteins by ss <dig> infection
highly pathogenic ss <dig> infection could cause up-regulated expression of a large set of genes involved in the inflammatory response and acute phase proteins by microarray analysis.
il-1b, il- <dig> and il- <dig> could be induced by foreign pathogens and play essential roles in controlling infections  <cit> .
however, they may also cause pathology when these productions are excessive or uncontrolled  <cit> .
ye et al.
also found that significantly high level of cytokines could be induced by highly pathogenic ss <dig> strain and play important roles in sepsis  <cit> , which is in coincidence with ours.
in addition, quite a few genes related to inflammatory response were found up-regulated, such as s <dig> family proteins   <cit> , pentraxin  <dig>  <cit>  and resistin  <cit> .
they play important roles in mediating inflammatory responses, recruiting inflammatory cells to sites of tissue damage or contributing to resisting the invasion of various pathogens.
acute phase proteins , such as lactotransferrin  <cit> , haptoglobin  <cit> , serum amyloid a  <dig>  <cit>  and coagulation factor xiii, were involved in physiologic reactions initiated early in the inflammatory process  <cit> , and could be a response to s. suis infection  <cit> .
cebpd belonging to the ccaat-enhancer binding protein  family which is crucial in the regulation of genes involved in immunity and inflammation.
these up-regulated genes are the representative of host acute response struggling to eliminate invading pathogens.
induction of genes related in cell adhesion and stress response
cell adhesion molecules  have been implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of fundamental cellular processes, such as cell adhesion, cell polarization, survival, movement, and proliferation  <cit> .
e-selectin is a cell adhesion molecule expressed on endothelial cells activated by cytokines, and plays an important role in recruiting leukocytes to the site of injury  <cit> .
versican can bind adhesion molecules on the surface of inflammatory leukocytes  <cit>  and act as a tlr <dig> agonist in inducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines  <cit> .
thrombospondin  <dig> is an adhesive glycoprotein that mediates cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions and it could interact with numerous proteases involved in angiogenesis  <cit> .
mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule  <dig> is predominantly expressed on high endothelial venules in inflamed tissues, and could assist the extravasations of leucocyte  <cit> .
the up-regulation of cell adhesion molecules after ss <dig> infection would contribute to recruiting leukocytes to the site of infection, which could control infection.
genes related to oxidative stress and homeostasis were also identified to be up-regulated.
sod <dig> provides vital protection against reactive oxygen species , thus protecting tissues from damage in a broad range of disease states.
the secretion of pge <dig>  together with nitric oxide production, is involved in disruption of the blood-brain barrier in an experimental model of bacterial meningitis  <cit> .
s. suis-mediated pge <dig> production by human macrophages was also noticed by jobin and contributed to the bbb disruption  <cit> .
toll-like receptors  pathway analysis
activation of the innate immune response is controlled in large part by the toll-like receptor  family of pattern-recognition receptors.
the previous study showed that s. suis was mainly recognized via tlr <dig> by thp- <dig> monocytes, which was associated with cd <dig>  <cit>  and led to the release of pro-inflammatory mediators  <cit> .
the strong activation of tlr <dig> and cd <dig> was also observed in murine brain parenchyma after the presence of s. suis bacteremia  <cit> .
a recent research indicated that components released during s. suis infection as well as penicillin-treated whole bacteria could induce nf-kb activation through tlr2/ <dig>  <cit> .
the obvious elevation of tlr <dig>  and cd <dig>  was noticed at transcript level in spleens after highly pathogenic ss <dig> infection.
unsurprisingly, myd <dig>  an adaptor molecule in downstream signaling events with tlrs and cd <dig>  was up-regulated at the level of  <dig>  fold .
in contrast, the effect could not be seen with avirulent ss <dig> infection.
down-regulated transcripts following s. suis infection
the majority of down-regulated genes were related to transcription, transport, material and energy metabolism .
highly pathogenic strain could show high level of toxicity to host cells  <cit> , and as a result, the influenced cells could hardly to be active.
so these down regulations could be regarded the representative of the reduced vital activity of ss2-influenced cells.
discussion
two recent ss <dig> outbreaks in china not only seriously challenged public health but also shocked the scientific community, calling for the basic and translational studies of s. suis.
until now, several proteins were identified as vaccine candidates  <cit>  and drug targets  <cit>  for controlling ss <dig>  in addition, emphasis is also extended to the pathogenesis study.
several pathogenic factors were successfully identified and strengthened the understanding for the virulence of the bacterium.
as infectious disease resulted from the interplay between pathogens and the defense of the hosts they infect, host immune response was especially essential for understanding the diseases  <cit> .
in the present study, we tried to compare the gene expression profiles of spleens from swine suffering from highly pathogenic ss <dig>  from swine infected with the avirulent isogenic strain, and from swine inoculated with pbs respectively to reveal the host immune response to ss <dig> and the contributions of host response to ss <dig> diseases.
it is not accidental that significant changes of gene expression profiles could be noticed when infected with highly pathogenic ss <dig> compared with mock-infected samples, while avirulent isogenic strain would cause similar profiles to mock-infected samples .
these indicated that avirulent isogenic strain could hardly cause significant gene expression which was coincident with the fact that no significant clinical symptoms could be noticed in pigs.
moreover, the obvious changes in gene expression profiles were highly associated with significant clinical signs on day  <dig> post-inoculation with highly pathogenic strain.
further analysis of the present study indicated that the majority of down-regulated genes were mainly involved in transcription, transport, material and energy metabolism which were representative of the reduced vital activity of ss2-influenced cells.
however, the up-regulated genes were principally related to immune response, such as genes involved in inflammatory response; acute-phase/immune response; cell adhesion and response to stress.
undoubtedly, it would be meaningful to explore the roles of these genes in ss2-caused diseases.
first of all, it is necessary to know how ss <dig> induces immune response.
it is well acknowledged that tlrs are transmembrane proteins that could recognize specific pamps and eventually result in the activation of nf-kb and map kinases to elicit regulatory response  <cit> .
among these transmembrane proteins, tlr- <dig> could recognize bacterial lam, blp and pgn by following their initial interaction with cd <dig>  previous reports indicated that s. suis mainly induced proinflammatory cytokines by tlr <dig> of human macrophages and murine brain  <cit> , and several proinflammatory cytokines, such as il-1b, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnf-a and mcp- <dig> could be triggered  <cit> .
in our study, large doses of bacteria could be isolated from spleens of wt-infected pigs while no bacterium could be found to exist in pigs infected with Δhp <dig>  in coincidence with these, tlr- <dig> pathway and several proinflammatory cytokines were induced only in wt-infected pigs.
Δhp <dig> showed similar transcript profile as control pigs due to either failing to invading or being easily eliminated by host.
in contrast, the large doses of bacteria effected maximal cytokines release in wt-infected pigs  <cit> .
the exaggerated high levels of cytokines perhaps exacerbate the inflammation and were considered to be responsible for s. suis caused diseases  <cit> .
so the successful lethal pathogens could persistently induce cytokines secreted originally to clear the foreign invader, and as a result, the host's defense was utilized by s. suis to cause diseases, and to some extent to death.
as we all know that the secreted cytokine is an important part of a host defense system, which could recruit inflammatory cells to sites of tissue damage and help to eliminate the pathogens.
however, this innate defense system is a double edged sword.
if the recruiting inflammatory cells could kill the invader, the disease could be controlled.
on the opposite side, if the recruiting phagocytes could not efficiently kill the bacteria, the tide would be turned to pathogen's favor, and the persistently induced cytokines would result in the exacerbated inflammation and lead to the death during the septic phase of infection.
these might be the reason why the survival rate could be elevated when inflammation was inhibited by il- <dig>  <cit> , and why the level of cytokine was correlated inversely with survival time in patients with sepsis  <cit> .
in coincidence with our analysis, pathogenic s. suis could effectively resist the uptake by phagocytes and cps could inhibit activation of signaling pathways involved in phagocytosis  <cit> .
in addition, several virulence-associated proteins such as fbps <cit> , pdga <cit> , lta <cit> , hp <dig> , serine protease  <cit>  etc.
were also contributed to the phagocytosis resistance, and the up-regulation of these proteins in vivo may suggest the better phagocytosis resistance  <cit> .
due to failing phagocytosis, bacteria could not only cause exacerbated inflammation but also contribute to its survival in the bloodstream in ""modified trojan horse"" theory in which bacteria travel extracellularly while attached to, but not phagocytosed  <cit> , and then cause bacteremia and even septemia.
one of the key questions to be answered is how s. suis crosses the blood-brain barrier to cause meningitis, which was observed in all wt-infected pigs.
the findings of the reported study presented that suilysin-positive strain could show toxin to produce functional alteration and increase the permeability of bbb; and suilysin-negative strain might stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines resulting in alteration of bbb permeability  <cit> .
and they also indicated that this highly pathogenic strain could produce high level of toxins in vivo-suilysin, mrp, hyl  <cit> , and undoubtedly it would contribute to the penetration of deep tissue and bbb.
in addition, the stimulated production of proinflammatory cytokines would result in the alteration of bbb permeability, and it would be more feasible for s. suis to break through bbb.
from our understanding, wt strain could utilize the synergic effect of toxins and high level of cytokines to accelerate the penetration of deep tissue and bbb.
these might be the reason why the strain could cause severe human diseases in sichuan,  <dig>
CONCLUSIONS
microarray technology has been used to analyse the globle porcine transcriptional response to infection with various pathogenic microorganisms recently.
study on the transcriptional response to the gram-positive bacterium ss <dig> by using the affymetrix genechip porcine genome array has not been reported until now.
although great efforts have been made to understand the molecular basis of this infection, the response to ss <dig> infection is still largely unknown.
transcriptome analysis based on s. suis-infected spleens could improved the interference received by the cells analysis, and also supply the solid supplementary for analysis on alveolar macrophages.
highly pathogenic s. suis could persistently induce cytokines mainly by tlr <dig> pathway, and eventually the high level of cytokines and toxins secreted by phagocytosis-resistant bacteria could destroy deep tissues, and cause meningitis, septicaemia, pneumonia, endocarditis, and arthritis.

inducing excessive inflammation is recognized as one of the reasons why highly invasive ss <dig> strain could cause severe diseases  <cit> . a few previous studies indicated that high level of cytokines and chemokines could be released by human brain microvascular endothelial cells  <cit> , a whole-blood culture system  <cit> , macrophages  <cit>  and monocytes  <cit>  stimulated by ss <dig>  and have important roles in the initiation and development of inflammation and meningitis  <cit> . more direct proofs were the studies on mice with different genetic background, which indicated that il- <dig> was responsible, at least in part, for the high survival, which suggested that aberrant innate immune response contributed to ss <dig> diseases  <cit> .

to be aware of the information about host immune response would enable people to better understand the disease. transcriptional response of alveolar macrophages to ss <dig> has been performed and the results indicated that nf-kb and map-kinases signaling pathways were induced upon interaction with ss <dig>  <cit> . however, it is not easy to get more information since the primary macrophages are so sensitive to the interference. spleen plays an important role in immune response and could be an ideal target to study host immune response against infection  <cit> . in the present study, the gene expression profiles of swine spleens which suffered from highly pathogenic ss <dig>  avirulent isogenic strain and pbs respectively were investigated to reveal the host immune response to ss <dig> and the contributions of host response to ss <dig> diseases.

RESULTS
transcriptome analysis
the transcriptome analysis indicated that  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  probe sets, corresponding to  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all probe sets, were detected in wt, Δhp <dig> and mock-infected pig spleens respectively . the expression profiles of porcine spleens challenged with wt  <dig> days post inoculation were compared with those of the mock-infected group. after quantile normalization and statistical analysis,  <dig> transcripts were identified at the global false discovery rate  of 10% . furthermore, the criteria of a two-fold or greater change in differential expression and a fdr of 10% were chosen to determine up-regulated and down-regulated genes in the wt infected replicates. using these criteria,  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts, representing  <dig> and  <dig> unique genes, were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated respectively . however, only a few genes showed significantly differential expressions when comparing Δhp <dig> with mock-infected samples .

of the  <dig> unique de transcripts,  <dig> transcripts could be determined based on blastx searches and annotated with david or by searching against the genbank database . among these,  <dig> unique genes were grouped into  <dig> categories based on biological process gene ontology  terms or according to their potential biology process classification by referring to recent publications . unsurprisingly, the majority of genes were related to the immune response, transcription, transport, material and energy metabolism, etc. .

de genes which putative functions assigned based on go term and manual annotation. manual annotations were listed in italics. many genes with multiple functions were only listed in one category according to specific biology processes. ""fc≥2"" represents up regulation , ""fc ≤  <dig> "" represents down regulation.

validation of microarray data by quantitative real-time pcr 
the qpcr was performed to validate the expression patterns during infection for specific genes identified in the microarray assay. in order to validate the differential expression of various identified genes,  <dig> up-regulated genes, with the increase ranging from  <dig> -fold to  <dig> -fold, and  <dig> down-regulated genes, with the decrease ranging from  <dig> -fold to  <dig> -fold, were selected for qpcr analysis. all the selected down-regulated genes could be amplified from the control samples but failed to achieve significant detectable signs from wt-infected spleens, except for alox <dig> which showed  <dig> -fold down-regulated expression. all selected up-regulated genes showed higher expression in wt-infected samples than in the control samples . though variation in fold changes could be observed between qpcr and microarray , the differential expression patterns were coincident between the results of the two techniques, which indicated the reliability of the microarray analysis.

induction of inflammasomes and acute phase proteins by ss <dig> infection
highly pathogenic ss <dig> infection could cause up-regulated expression of a large set of genes involved in the inflammatory response and acute phase proteins by microarray analysis. il-1b, il- <dig> and il- <dig> could be induced by foreign pathogens and play essential roles in controlling infections  <cit> . however, they may also cause pathology when these productions are excessive or uncontrolled  <cit> . ye et al. also found that significantly high level of cytokines could be induced by highly pathogenic ss <dig> strain and play important roles in sepsis  <cit> , which is in coincidence with ours. in addition, quite a few genes related to inflammatory response were found up-regulated, such as s <dig> family proteins   <cit> , pentraxin  <dig>  <cit>  and resistin  <cit> . they play important roles in mediating inflammatory responses, recruiting inflammatory cells to sites of tissue damage or contributing to resisting the invasion of various pathogens.

acute phase proteins , such as lactotransferrin  <cit> , haptoglobin  <cit> , serum amyloid a  <dig>  <cit>  and coagulation factor xiii, were involved in physiologic reactions initiated early in the inflammatory process  <cit> , and could be a response to s. suis infection  <cit> . cebpd belonging to the ccaat-enhancer binding protein  family which is crucial in the regulation of genes involved in immunity and inflammation. these up-regulated genes are the representative of host acute response struggling to eliminate invading pathogens.

induction of genes related in cell adhesion and stress response
cell adhesion molecules  have been implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of fundamental cellular processes, such as cell adhesion, cell polarization, survival, movement, and proliferation  <cit> . e-selectin is a cell adhesion molecule expressed on endothelial cells activated by cytokines, and plays an important role in recruiting leukocytes to the site of injury  <cit> . versican can bind adhesion molecules on the surface of inflammatory leukocytes  <cit>  and act as a tlr <dig> agonist in inducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines  <cit> . thrombospondin  <dig> is an adhesive glycoprotein that mediates cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions and it could interact with numerous proteases involved in angiogenesis  <cit> . mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule  <dig> is predominantly expressed on high endothelial venules in inflamed tissues, and could assist the extravasations of leucocyte  <cit> . the up-regulation of cell adhesion molecules after ss <dig> infection would contribute to recruiting leukocytes to the site of infection, which could control infection.

genes related to oxidative stress and homeostasis were also identified to be up-regulated. sod <dig> provides vital protection against reactive oxygen species , thus protecting tissues from damage in a broad range of disease states. the secretion of pge <dig>  together with nitric oxide production, is involved in disruption of the blood-brain barrier in an experimental model of bacterial meningitis  <cit> . s. suis-mediated pge <dig> production by human macrophages was also noticed by jobin and contributed to the bbb disruption  <cit> .

toll-like receptors  pathway analysis
activation of the innate immune response is controlled in large part by the toll-like receptor  family of pattern-recognition receptors. the previous study showed that s. suis was mainly recognized via tlr <dig> by thp- <dig> monocytes, which was associated with cd <dig>  <cit>  and led to the release of pro-inflammatory mediators  <cit> . the strong activation of tlr <dig> and cd <dig> was also observed in murine brain parenchyma after the presence of s. suis bacteremia  <cit> . a recent research indicated that components released during s. suis infection as well as penicillin-treated whole bacteria could induce nf-kb activation through tlr2/ <dig>  <cit> . the obvious elevation of tlr <dig>  and cd <dig>  was noticed at transcript level in spleens after highly pathogenic ss <dig> infection. unsurprisingly, myd <dig>  an adaptor molecule in downstream signaling events with tlrs and cd <dig>  was up-regulated at the level of  <dig>  fold . in contrast, the effect could not be seen with avirulent ss <dig> infection.

down-regulated transcripts following s. suis infection
the majority of down-regulated genes were related to transcription, transport, material and energy metabolism . highly pathogenic strain could show high level of toxicity to host cells  <cit> , and as a result, the influenced cells could hardly to be active. so these down regulations could be regarded the representative of the reduced vital activity of ss2-influenced cells.

discussion
two recent ss <dig> outbreaks in china not only seriously challenged public health but also shocked the scientific community, calling for the basic and translational studies of s. suis. until now, several proteins were identified as vaccine candidates  <cit>  and drug targets  <cit>  for controlling ss <dig>  in addition, emphasis is also extended to the pathogenesis study. several pathogenic factors were successfully identified and strengthened the understanding for the virulence of the bacterium. as infectious disease resulted from the interplay between pathogens and the defense of the hosts they infect, host immune response was especially essential for understanding the diseases  <cit> .

in the present study, we tried to compare the gene expression profiles of spleens from swine suffering from highly pathogenic ss <dig>  from swine infected with the avirulent isogenic strain, and from swine inoculated with pbs respectively to reveal the host immune response to ss <dig> and the contributions of host response to ss <dig> diseases. it is not accidental that significant changes of gene expression profiles could be noticed when infected with highly pathogenic ss <dig> compared with mock-infected samples, while avirulent isogenic strain would cause similar profiles to mock-infected samples . these indicated that avirulent isogenic strain could hardly cause significant gene expression which was coincident with the fact that no significant clinical symptoms could be noticed in pigs. moreover, the obvious changes in gene expression profiles were highly associated with significant clinical signs on day  <dig> post-inoculation with highly pathogenic strain. further analysis of the present study indicated that the majority of down-regulated genes were mainly involved in transcription, transport, material and energy metabolism which were representative of the reduced vital activity of ss2-influenced cells. however, the up-regulated genes were principally related to immune response, such as genes involved in inflammatory response; acute-phase/immune response; cell adhesion and response to stress. undoubtedly, it would be meaningful to explore the roles of these genes in ss2-caused diseases.

first of all, it is necessary to know how ss <dig> induces immune response. it is well acknowledged that tlrs are transmembrane proteins that could recognize specific pamps and eventually result in the activation of nf-kb and map kinases to elicit regulatory response  <cit> . among these transmembrane proteins, tlr- <dig> could recognize bacterial lam, blp and pgn by following their initial interaction with cd <dig>  previous reports indicated that s. suis mainly induced proinflammatory cytokines by tlr <dig> of human macrophages and murine brain  <cit> , and several proinflammatory cytokines, such as il-1b, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnf-a and mcp- <dig> could be triggered  <cit> . in our study, large doses of bacteria could be isolated from spleens of wt-infected pigs while no bacterium could be found to exist in pigs infected with Δhp <dig>  in coincidence with these, tlr- <dig> pathway and several proinflammatory cytokines were induced only in wt-infected pigs. Δhp <dig> showed similar transcript profile as control pigs due to either failing to invading or being easily eliminated by host. in contrast, the large doses of bacteria effected maximal cytokines release in wt-infected pigs  <cit> . the exaggerated high levels of cytokines perhaps exacerbate the inflammation and were considered to be responsible for s. suis caused diseases  <cit> . so the successful lethal pathogens could persistently induce cytokines secreted originally to clear the foreign invader, and as a result, the host's defense was utilized by s. suis to cause diseases, and to some extent to death.

as we all know that the secreted cytokine is an important part of a host defense system, which could recruit inflammatory cells to sites of tissue damage and help to eliminate the pathogens. however, this innate defense system is a double edged sword. if the recruiting inflammatory cells could kill the invader, the disease could be controlled. on the opposite side, if the recruiting phagocytes could not efficiently kill the bacteria, the tide would be turned to pathogen's favor, and the persistently induced cytokines would result in the exacerbated inflammation and lead to the death during the septic phase of infection. these might be the reason why the survival rate could be elevated when inflammation was inhibited by il- <dig>  <cit> , and why the level of cytokine was correlated inversely with survival time in patients with sepsis  <cit> . in coincidence with our analysis, pathogenic s. suis could effectively resist the uptake by phagocytes and cps could inhibit activation of signaling pathways involved in phagocytosis  <cit> . in addition, several virulence-associated proteins such as fbps <cit> , pdga <cit> , lta <cit> , hp <dig> , serine protease  <cit>  etc. were also contributed to the phagocytosis resistance, and the up-regulation of these proteins in vivo may suggest the better phagocytosis resistance  <cit> . due to failing phagocytosis, bacteria could not only cause exacerbated inflammation but also contribute to its survival in the bloodstream in ""modified trojan horse"" theory in which bacteria travel extracellularly while attached to, but not phagocytosed  <cit> , and then cause bacteremia and even septemia.

one of the key questions to be answered is how s. suis crosses the blood-brain barrier to cause meningitis, which was observed in all wt-infected pigs. the findings of the reported study presented that suilysin-positive strain could show toxin to produce functional alteration and increase the permeability of bbb; and suilysin-negative strain might stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines resulting in alteration of bbb permeability  <cit> . and they also indicated that this highly pathogenic strain could produce high level of toxins in vivo-suilysin, mrp, hyl  <cit> , and undoubtedly it would contribute to the penetration of deep tissue and bbb. in addition, the stimulated production of proinflammatory cytokines would result in the alteration of bbb permeability, and it would be more feasible for s. suis to break through bbb. from our understanding, wt strain could utilize the synergic effect of toxins and high level of cytokines to accelerate the penetration of deep tissue and bbb. these might be the reason why the strain could cause severe human diseases in sichuan,  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
microarray technology has been used to analyse the globle porcine transcriptional response to infection with various pathogenic microorganisms recently. study on the transcriptional response to the gram-positive bacterium ss <dig> by using the affymetrix genechip porcine genome array has not been reported until now. although great efforts have been made to understand the molecular basis of this infection, the response to ss <dig> infection is still largely unknown. transcriptome analysis based on s. suis-infected spleens could improved the interference received by the cells analysis, and also supply the solid supplementary for analysis on alveolar macrophages. highly pathogenic s. suis could persistently induce cytokines mainly by tlr <dig> pathway, and eventually the high level of cytokines and toxins secreted by phagocytosis-resistant bacteria could destroy deep tissues, and cause meningitis, septicaemia, pneumonia, endocarditis, and arthritis.

"BACKGROUND
the computational analysis of dna sequences represents a major endeavor in the post-genomic era.
the increasing number of whole-genome sequencing projects has provided an enormous amount of information which leads to the need of new tools and string processing algorithms to analyze and classify the obtained sequences  <cit> .
in this regard, the study of short functional dna segments, such as transcriptional factor binding sites, has emerged as an important effort to understand key control mechanisms.
for example, it is now known that the presence of certain sequences of motifs in promoter regions determines the effective regulation of gene transcription, a central feature of gene regulatory networks.
dna motifs can be represented in a number of different ways.
position specific scoring matrices  and consensi  are amongst the most commonly used.
however, several other more sophisticated methods have been proposed to represent motifs, some of them able to take into account statistical or deterministic dependencies between positions  <cit> .
our approach is independent of the way motifs are modeled, since it requires only the list of occurrences of motifs, something that can be obtained from any motif representation.
motif finding is the problem of discovering motifs, that may correspond to transcription factor binding sites, without any prior knowledge of their characteristics.
these motifs can be found by analyzing regulatory regions taken from genes of the same organism or from related genes of different organisms.
many approaches have been proposed and one can find an impressive collection of published articles describing algorithms to address the problem.
currently available methods can roughly be classified in two main classes: probabilistic  <cit>  and combinatorial  <cit> .
this classification covers most, although not all, popular motif finders currently available.
the major drawback with these algorithms is their inability to discriminate the biologically relevant extracted motifs from the potentially numerous false hits.
probabilistic motif finders also have problems when the motifs are highly degenerated.
the problem of determining what portion of the output corresponds to a biologically significant result has been addressed mostly through the use of statistical techniques and biological reasoning, and it is a challenge in its own right.
in this regard, the correct assessment of which of those observations may have occurred just by chance is a mandatory step in the process of identifying biologically meaningful features.
this is the main rationale for the construction of stochastic models that can provide estimates for the expected number of occurrences of a given sequence.
these models are based on some assumed distribution for the sequence of bases, such as the one defined by a markov chain  <cit> , and are then used to compute the expected number of occurrences, under the null hypothesis, h <dig>  that assumes that the sequence is randomly generated in accordance with the assumed distribution.
sequences that are over-represented, in a statistically significant way, are considered as potentially significant, as they are highly unlikely to have been generated by chance.
this is usually done by determining a p-value for each extracted motif that assesses its relative expectedness/randomness under the specific pre-defined model, based on the expected vs. observed number of occurrences.
this step makes for an efficient filtering of the output without loosing a significant amount of information and to the correct assessment of the motifs that are under or over-expressed.
however, this approach is not very selective, and it is hard to apply to small motifs  or to other motifs that are not over-represented, but that, nonetheless, are biologically significant.
one possible way around this limitation is to look at other characteristics of the motifs, such as the positional distribution in the regions under analysis.
the idea of analyzing the positional distribution of motif occurrences was developed recently  <cit> , suggesting that several motifs occurring in natural sequences have strong positional preferences.
for example, it is well known that in prokaryote promoter regions, the tata-box occurs near position - <dig>  and the ttgaca motif usually occurs near position - <dig>  in eukaryotes, the best-characterized core promoter elements consist of a tata-box located approximately  <dig> nucleotides upstream from the start site, an initiator element located at the transcription start site, and a downstream promoter element  located approximately  <dig> nucleotides downstream from the transcription start.
the functionality of genome regions is intrinsically related with their ability to fold in tri-dimensional structures, which clearly indicates that positional bias should be incorporated in the models and analyzed from a statistical point of view.
a number of recent studies have focused on this property, both in terms of absolute  <cit>  and relative  <cit>  positioning of the different motifs.
these studies, however, address the positioning of specific, well identified, motifs, but none of them, to our knowledge, presented complete quantitative results and a comprehensive analysis of this feature, that can be used to actually distinguish between relevant and non-relevant motifs.
in particular, there is no clear proposal of which is the best test to identify and classify the motifs in terms of their positional distribution along the genome.
in this article we propose to integrate position uniformity tests and over-representation tests based on markov models to improve the posterior classification of the motifs and better assess their biological significance.
for the position uniformity tests, the input data corresponds to vectors of motif positions in the input sequences where the motif appears.
specifically, we compute the position of each occurrence of each motif, relative to the translation start site, and build a list of these positions.
this list will be analyzed for uniformity using a statistical test.
we started this analysis by first comparing different statistical methodologies commonly used to test uniformity, namely the chi-square goodness-of-fit test and the kolmogorov-smirnov  test  <cit> .
since the motifs may appear in a small number of positions, a bootstrap  <cit>  version of the chi-square test, that can cope with small sample sizes, was also evaluated.
these tests were first validated on artificially generated data to better analyze the results, assessing their sensitivity and specificity as well as the receiver operating characteristic  curves.
based on these results, the bootstrap chi-square test was chosen as it proved to be the most powerful test for small sample sizes.
the bootstrap chi-square test was then used in the study of the positional distribution of motifs in the promoter sequences of different organisms, namely bakers yeast , human , fruit fly , escherichia coli and several dicotyledons plants.
motifs that appeared at least in a given fraction of the sequences  were extracted, from these data sets, using a motif finder.
for each extracted motif, a p-value was calculated, under the null hypothesis, that assumes a uniform distribution for the motif positions.
the combination of over-representation tests, that take into account the specific sequence of bases, and position uniformity tests, that consider the positional distribution of the motifs, has the potential to represent a more powerful technique for motif classification, than the ones currently used.
this methodology is easily adapted to other computational biology applications where position is thought to be biologically relevant and where the non-uniformity of observed motifs may provide strong indication of biological relevance .
RESULTS
in this section we present the results of applying the proposed methodology to both artificially generated  and real data sets.
the artificial data sets were first used to compare the three analyzed uniformity tests, the chi-square goodness-of-fit test, the kolmogorov-smirnov test and the chi-square bootstrap test.
the uniformity test that obtained the best results was then applied to classify the motifs extracted, by a motif finder, from a number of real data sets, from different organisms.
in this section we present only the results obtained for the saccharomyces cerevisiae data sets, but results for other organisms are also available .
comparison of position uniformity tests
artificial data sets generated from uniform and beta distributions were used in this comparison .
specifically, we generated a number of positions, normalized to the unit interval, that emulate, what, in the real data, corresponds to the positions of motif occurrences.
for each of these distributions, the sensitivity and the specificity of the three uniformity tests was assessed.
specifically, we used these tests to evaluate the probability that h <dig> is true, i.e., that the given samples originated in a uniform distribution.
the results obtained are presented in figures  <dig> and .
figure  illustrate the obtained roc curves, as described in the methods section, for distinct beta distribution functions, beta, beta and beta, respectively.
these curves were calculated using a sample size of  <dig> observations and  <dig> bins to guarantee five expected counts per class.
the results show that all tests present the expected sensitivity, as imposed by the level of significance .
they correctly identified the majority, around 95%, of the uniform instances of different lengths when a level of α = 5% is chosen.
instances drawn from beta distributions were in general also correctly identified by the three tests.
the more asymmetric the distribution is, the more powerful the ks test becomes.
for distributions with lower variance and higher symmetry the bootstrap version of chi-square becomes the more powerful test, as shown in figure  <dig>
the power of the tests increases as the samples become larger, as would be expected.
from these results it is possible to see that the kolmogorov-smirnov test is less powerful than the other two tests.
both chi-square goodness-of-fit and the chi-square bootstrap tests present a similar behavior.
for small sample sizes, the determination of the optimal number of bins in the chi-square test was achieved by testing different rules.
one of the most common is to guarantee a minimum number of five expected counts per bin, which leads to nbins = ⌊x/5⌋, where x is the sample size.
however, when this value is between  <dig> and  <dig> it is advisable to use three classes.
in effect, it would be virtually impossible to distinguish a symmetric distribution using two bins defined by the edges .
when using three bins there is a significant increase of specificity values, which strengthens the application of chi-square with a modified rule for the number of bins.
furthermore, this assessment and further testing on simulated data led to the application of a modified rule for determining the number of bins, described by nbins = ⌊x/5⌋ +  <dig>  for sample sizes up to  <dig>  this was shown to increase the specificity.
the graphs of figure  <dig> show the specificity of the test for different beta distribution functions as a function of sample size, using a combination of both rules: from  <dig> to  <dig> one extra bin was applied to improve the classification, from  <dig> to  <dig> the usual 5-per-bin formula was employed.
these results also show that there is a real advantage in using bootstrap methodologies.
when the size of the sample is small, , the results show that the chi-square bootstrap test exhibits the best ability to detect non-uniformity.
although the difference between the bootstrap version and the standard test appears to be marginal, one should use the simulation results to fix the desired sensitivity.
in fact, only by using the empirical distribution of the test statistic, is it possible to correctly adjust the level of significance for small samples.
this is because the distribution in this case markedly deviates from the chi-square standard distribution.
these results therefore indicate that the chi-square test with bootstrap achieves the best performance and should therefore be used to assess the uniformity of motif positions in real data, specially when the number of occurrences is small.
analysis of the saccharomyces cerevisiae data sets
in this section we present the results obtained with the chi-square bootstrap test in the analysis of the positional distribution of dna motifs in the promoter regions of saccharomyces cerevisiae.
for this analysis, six data sets of promoter sequences were considered .
for each data set the following procedure was used:
<dig>  a motif finder algorithm, riso  <cit> , was used to identify motifs that occurred in a given fraction  of the sequences.
<dig>  motifs were ordered in accordance to the computed statistical significance of the deviation of the number of occurrences observed vs. expected.
motifs were considered over-represented in a statistically significant way if the p-value was smaller than 10- <dig>
<dig>  a p-value for the likelihood of a uniform distribution of each motif was obtained, using the chi-square bootstrap test, using a significance level, α, equal to  <dig> .
with this analysis, it is possible to define four motif classes, according to their classification in the over-representation and uniformity tests.
motifs that are both over-represented and non-uniformly distributed are very likely to have some biological function.
our analysis will be centered on these motifs, although, at times, we will also look at motifs that are not seen as strongly over-represented but are distributed in a non-uniform way in the promoter regions.
core promoter elements
for the analysis of the positional distribution of several core promoter elements, a data set containing  <dig> promoter sequences from saccharomyces cerevisiae was considered.
this data set includes a significant fraction of the gene promoters for this organism.
for eukaryotic species there exists a set of well characterized core promoter elements, that include the tata-box and the gc-box.
the documented consensi for these sites are:
• tata-box  <cit> :
tataa
• gc-box:  <cit>
ggggcgggtatataaat
following the procedure described, the riso algorithm was instructed to extract simple motifs, with sizes between  <dig> and  <dig>  and a minimum quorum of 20%.
table  <dig> shows the results obtained.
it is possible to see that almost all the motifs extracted  were classified as being non-uniformly distributed.
from the non-uniform group,  <dig> were classified as over-represented in a statistically significant way.
the first ranked motifs in this sub-group correspond to motifs that match previously described consensi.
for example, motifs like tataaa, tatata, tatataa, tatatat, and tataaaa match with the tata-box; gggta, and gggcg fit the gc-box profile.
in figure  <dig> it is also possible to observe the positional distribution of a set of motifs that corresponds to the gc-box.
the p-values obtained for the uniformity test for these elements are much lower than  <dig> , suggesting non-uniformity and stressing that these motifs have a positional preference.
however, only the tata-box has been classified as over-represented in a statistically significant way.
this is a case where the application of a non-uniformity test would identify biologically significant motifs that would go unnoticed by the over-representation tests.
the results obtained for this data set show that most of the extracted motifs are classified as non-uniformly distributed.
this result was somehow expected since the motif finder was instructed to extract motifs with a minimum quorum of 20% in a large data set of  <dig> promoter sequences.
this means that each motif must be present in at least  <dig> sequences.
some of the motifs extracted correspond to known transcription factors binding sites and a large number corresponds to motifs that are important in the context of the chromatin regulation.
most of these motifs are known to have a positional preference.
in this example, we did not perform a detailed analysis of all the motifs extracted, since they are too numerous.
the objective was to identify well characterized motifs that have positional preference and that may not be over-represented in a statistically significant way.
aft2p
this data set contains the promoter regions of  <dig> genes that are documented to be regulated by the transcription factor aft2p.
the documented consensus for this tf are the motifs: cgcaccc, ggcaccc, tgcaccc and ykcacccr.
for this data set, riso was instructed to extract simple conserved motifs, with sizes between  <dig> and  <dig>  and a minimum quorum of 50%.
table  <dig> presents the number of motifs classified in each of the four classes defined by the combination of the uniformity and over-representation statistical tests.
from a total of  <dig> motifs extracted, only  <dig> are considered to be non-uniform.
a set of  <dig> out of these  <dig> are classified as over-represented.
this small group includes the motif caccc, which corresponds to the core conserved motif described for this tf binding site.
the p-value for the uniformity test for this motif was  <dig> e -  <dig>  the complete consensus that corresponds to this tf binding site was not reported, since this it is only present in a small number of sequences in this data set.
dal80p
this data set includes  <dig> promoter sequences of genes documented to be regulated by the transcription factor dal80p.
the biological consensus described consists of two identical motifs, gataag, separated by  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs.
for this data set the motif finder was instructed to extract simple conserved motifs, with sizes between  <dig> and  <dig>  and a minimum quorum of 50%.
table  <dig> presents the number of motifs included in each of the four classes.
from a total of  <dig> motifs, only  <dig> are distributed non-uniformly, and only  <dig> of these are over-represented in a statistically significant way.
in this group of  <dig> motifs, it is possible to find the gataag motif, which is precisely the motif that corresponds to the biological consensus described.
the three other motifs that complete this group are the motifs cttatc, tatata and aagaaa.
the first one is the complement of the gataag motif, the second one is a tata-box that, as discussed before, has a positional preference and the last one is a motif already identified in yeast promoters as being one of the pre-mrna 3'-end-processing signals.
gln3p
this data set consists of  <dig> promoter sequences of genes regulated by the transcription factor gln3p.
the reported consensi for this tf binding site are the motifs gataag and gattag.
motifs with sizes between  <dig> and  <dig> bases and a minimum quorum of 50% were extracted by the motif finder.
table  <dig> presents the number of motifs included in each of the four classes.
a total of  <dig> motifs was extracted and classified.
from these, only  <dig> show positional preference.
in this group,  <dig> were classified as over-represented.
in this last group it is possible to find the motif gataag, that corresponds to one of the consensi described as a binding site for this tf.
the group also includes motifs that correspond to the general transcription factor tata-box: tatata, atataa and atatat and also the complement of the motif of interest.
the second consensus, gattag, was not found in any of the groups.
however, in the group of the  <dig> motifs that are not over-represented but are non-uniformly distributed, it is possible to find the motif ctaatc, that corresponds to the complement of this motif.
in this case the non-uniformity test may play a key role, if used to distinguish this motif from background noise.
met4p
this data set contains  <dig> promoter sequences of genes that are documented to be regulated by the transcription factor met4p.
the documented consensus for this tf binding site is the motif tcacgtg.
the motif finder was instructed to extract motifs with sizes between  <dig> and  <dig> bases and a minimum quorum of 50%.
table  <dig> presents the results.
a total of  <dig> motifs was extracted with these characteristics.
from these, only  <dig> were classified as over-represented and non-uniformly distributed.
this set of motifs includes the motif cacgtg, the only one that matches the described consensus.
the p-value obtained with the uniformity test for this motif was  <dig> e -  <dig>  as expected, motifs related to the tata-box, like the atataa, atatat and tatata, were also among this set of relevant motifs.
gat1p
this data set consists of  <dig> promoter regions of genes that are regulated by the transcription factor gat1p.
the consensus sequence of interest is the motif gataag.
motifs with sizes between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides and with a minimum quorum of 50% were extracted.
table  <dig> shows the results.
a total of  <dig> motifs were identified, with only  <dig> being classified as over-represented and non-uniformly distributed.
the motif gataag is included in the group of motifs that were classified as non over-represented and uniformly distributed .
however, the motif that has been classified as the most over-represented and also non-uniformly distributed was the motif cttatc, that is the complement of the motif of interest.
although, the motif gataag is reported as the binding site for the gat1p transcription factor, its reverse can also be considered  <cit> .
this reverse motif is particularly relevant if present between positions - <dig> and - <dig>  this position preference is exactly what is observed in this data set.
the two other motifs in this category are the motifs tatata and aagaaa, whose biological relevance was already reported in the analysis of the data set dal80p.
datasets for other organisms have also been analyzed, and confirm the obtained results are consisten with the ones presented in this section .
CONCLUSIONS
given these results, we propose that the integration of position uniformity tests and over-representation tests can be used to improve the accuracy of the classification of motifs found by combinatorial motif finders.
the study we performed on the positional distribution of several well known cis-regulatory elements, in the promoter sequences of different organisms, has shown that position conservation is a significant characteristic of many biologically significant motifs.
in particular, the results show that many biologically relevant motifs appear heterogeneously distributed in the promoter region of genes, and therefore, that non-uniformity is a good indicator of biological relevance.
in a number of instances where over-representation tests do not provide conclusive results, non-uniformity tests can be used to flag the relevant motifs.
this effect is most evident for small motifs, that are expected to appear a large number of times, and for small datasets, where the over-representation tests are not powerful enough to single out motifs that are biologically significant, but are only somewhat over-represented.
in particular, it is clear from the results that motifs that pass both tests are very strong candidates for further analysis.
this is an important point, specially for users of combinatorial motif finders, because it is sometimes hard to filter the relevant motifs from the large number of sequences identified by these methods.
in fact, currently used over-representation tests are likely either to miss important motifs that are not long enough, or to flag as significant motifs that are over-represented only by chance.
",581,"BACKGROUND
the computational analysis of dna sequences represents a major endeavor in the post-genomic era. the increasing number of whole-genome sequencing projects has provided an enormous amount of information which leads to the need of new tools and string processing algorithms to analyze and classify the obtained sequences  <cit> .

in this regard, the study of short functional dna segments, such as transcriptional factor binding sites, has emerged as an important effort to understand key control mechanisms. for example, it is now known that the presence of certain sequences of motifs in promoter regions determines the effective regulation of gene transcription, a central feature of gene regulatory networks.

dna motifs can be represented in a number of different ways. position specific scoring matrices  and consensi  are amongst the most commonly used. however, several other more sophisticated methods have been proposed to represent motifs, some of them able to take into account statistical or deterministic dependencies between positions  <cit> . our approach is independent of the way motifs are modeled, since it requires only the list of occurrences of motifs, something that can be obtained from any motif representation.

motif finding is the problem of discovering motifs, that may correspond to transcription factor binding sites, without any prior knowledge of their characteristics. these motifs can be found by analyzing regulatory regions taken from genes of the same organism or from related genes of different organisms. many approaches have been proposed and one can find an impressive collection of published articles describing algorithms to address the problem.

currently available methods can roughly be classified in two main classes: probabilistic  <cit>  and combinatorial  <cit> . this classification covers most, although not all, popular motif finders currently available.

the major drawback with these algorithms is their inability to discriminate the biologically relevant extracted motifs from the potentially numerous false hits. probabilistic motif finders also have problems when the motifs are highly degenerated. the problem of determining what portion of the output corresponds to a biologically significant result has been addressed mostly through the use of statistical techniques and biological reasoning, and it is a challenge in its own right. in this regard, the correct assessment of which of those observations may have occurred just by chance is a mandatory step in the process of identifying biologically meaningful features.

this is the main rationale for the construction of stochastic models that can provide estimates for the expected number of occurrences of a given sequence. these models are based on some assumed distribution for the sequence of bases, such as the one defined by a markov chain  <cit> , and are then used to compute the expected number of occurrences, under the null hypothesis, h <dig>  that assumes that the sequence is randomly generated in accordance with the assumed distribution. sequences that are over-represented, in a statistically significant way, are considered as potentially significant, as they are highly unlikely to have been generated by chance. this is usually done by determining a p-value for each extracted motif that assesses its relative expectedness/randomness under the specific pre-defined model, based on the expected vs. observed number of occurrences. this step makes for an efficient filtering of the output without loosing a significant amount of information and to the correct assessment of the motifs that are under or over-expressed. however, this approach is not very selective, and it is hard to apply to small motifs  or to other motifs that are not over-represented, but that, nonetheless, are biologically significant.

one possible way around this limitation is to look at other characteristics of the motifs, such as the positional distribution in the regions under analysis. the idea of analyzing the positional distribution of motif occurrences was developed recently  <cit> , suggesting that several motifs occurring in natural sequences have strong positional preferences. for example, it is well known that in prokaryote promoter regions, the tata-box occurs near position - <dig>  and the ttgaca motif usually occurs near position - <dig>  in eukaryotes, the best-characterized core promoter elements consist of a tata-box located approximately  <dig> nucleotides upstream from the start site, an initiator element located at the transcription start site, and a downstream promoter element  located approximately  <dig> nucleotides downstream from the transcription start.

the functionality of genome regions is intrinsically related with their ability to fold in tri-dimensional structures, which clearly indicates that positional bias should be incorporated in the models and analyzed from a statistical point of view. a number of recent studies have focused on this property, both in terms of absolute  <cit>  and relative  <cit>  positioning of the different motifs. these studies, however, address the positioning of specific, well identified, motifs, but none of them, to our knowledge, presented complete quantitative results and a comprehensive analysis of this feature, that can be used to actually distinguish between relevant and non-relevant motifs. in particular, there is no clear proposal of which is the best test to identify and classify the motifs in terms of their positional distribution along the genome.

in this article we propose to integrate position uniformity tests and over-representation tests based on markov models to improve the posterior classification of the motifs and better assess their biological significance.

for the position uniformity tests, the input data corresponds to vectors of motif positions in the input sequences where the motif appears. specifically, we compute the position of each occurrence of each motif, relative to the translation start site, and build a list of these positions. this list will be analyzed for uniformity using a statistical test. we started this analysis by first comparing different statistical methodologies commonly used to test uniformity, namely the chi-square goodness-of-fit test and the kolmogorov-smirnov  test  <cit> . since the motifs may appear in a small number of positions, a bootstrap  <cit>  version of the chi-square test, that can cope with small sample sizes, was also evaluated. these tests were first validated on artificially generated data to better analyze the results, assessing their sensitivity and specificity as well as the receiver operating characteristic  curves. based on these results, the bootstrap chi-square test was chosen as it proved to be the most powerful test for small sample sizes.

the bootstrap chi-square test was then used in the study of the positional distribution of motifs in the promoter sequences of different organisms, namely bakers yeast , human , fruit fly , escherichia coli and several dicotyledons plants. motifs that appeared at least in a given fraction of the sequences  were extracted, from these data sets, using a motif finder. for each extracted motif, a p-value was calculated, under the null hypothesis, that assumes a uniform distribution for the motif positions.

the combination of over-representation tests, that take into account the specific sequence of bases, and position uniformity tests, that consider the positional distribution of the motifs, has the potential to represent a more powerful technique for motif classification, than the ones currently used. this methodology is easily adapted to other computational biology applications where position is thought to be biologically relevant and where the non-uniformity of observed motifs may provide strong indication of biological relevance .

RESULTS
in this section we present the results of applying the proposed methodology to both artificially generated  and real data sets.

the artificial data sets were first used to compare the three analyzed uniformity tests, the chi-square goodness-of-fit test, the kolmogorov-smirnov test and the chi-square bootstrap test. the uniformity test that obtained the best results was then applied to classify the motifs extracted, by a motif finder, from a number of real data sets, from different organisms. in this section we present only the results obtained for the saccharomyces cerevisiae data sets, but results for other organisms are also available .

comparison of position uniformity tests
artificial data sets generated from uniform and beta distributions were used in this comparison . specifically, we generated a number of positions, normalized to the unit interval, that emulate, what, in the real data, corresponds to the positions of motif occurrences. for each of these distributions, the sensitivity and the specificity of the three uniformity tests was assessed. specifically, we used these tests to evaluate the probability that h <dig> is true, i.e., that the given samples originated in a uniform distribution.

the results obtained are presented in figures  <dig> and . figure  illustrate the obtained roc curves, as described in the methods section, for distinct beta distribution functions, beta, beta and beta, respectively. these curves were calculated using a sample size of  <dig> observations and  <dig> bins to guarantee five expected counts per class.

the results show that all tests present the expected sensitivity, as imposed by the level of significance . they correctly identified the majority, around 95%, of the uniform instances of different lengths when a level of α = 5% is chosen.

instances drawn from beta distributions were in general also correctly identified by the three tests. the more asymmetric the distribution is, the more powerful the ks test becomes. for distributions with lower variance and higher symmetry the bootstrap version of chi-square becomes the more powerful test, as shown in figure  <dig> 

the power of the tests increases as the samples become larger, as would be expected. from these results it is possible to see that the kolmogorov-smirnov test is less powerful than the other two tests. both chi-square goodness-of-fit and the chi-square bootstrap tests present a similar behavior.

for small sample sizes, the determination of the optimal number of bins in the chi-square test was achieved by testing different rules. one of the most common is to guarantee a minimum number of five expected counts per bin, which leads to nbins = ⌊x/5⌋, where x is the sample size. however, when this value is between  <dig> and  <dig> it is advisable to use three classes. in effect, it would be virtually impossible to distinguish a symmetric distribution using two bins defined by the edges . when using three bins there is a significant increase of specificity values, which strengthens the application of chi-square with a modified rule for the number of bins. furthermore, this assessment and further testing on simulated data led to the application of a modified rule for determining the number of bins, described by nbins = ⌊x/5⌋ +  <dig>  for sample sizes up to  <dig>  this was shown to increase the specificity. the graphs of figure  <dig> show the specificity of the test for different beta distribution functions as a function of sample size, using a combination of both rules: from  <dig> to  <dig> one extra bin was applied to improve the classification, from  <dig> to  <dig> the usual 5-per-bin formula was employed.

these results also show that there is a real advantage in using bootstrap methodologies. when the size of the sample is small, , the results show that the chi-square bootstrap test exhibits the best ability to detect non-uniformity. although the difference between the bootstrap version and the standard test appears to be marginal, one should use the simulation results to fix the desired sensitivity. in fact, only by using the empirical distribution of the test statistic, is it possible to correctly adjust the level of significance for small samples. this is because the distribution in this case markedly deviates from the chi-square standard distribution.

these results therefore indicate that the chi-square test with bootstrap achieves the best performance and should therefore be used to assess the uniformity of motif positions in real data, specially when the number of occurrences is small.

analysis of the saccharomyces cerevisiae data sets
in this section we present the results obtained with the chi-square bootstrap test in the analysis of the positional distribution of dna motifs in the promoter regions of saccharomyces cerevisiae. for this analysis, six data sets of promoter sequences were considered . for each data set the following procedure was used:

 <dig>  a motif finder algorithm, riso  <cit> , was used to identify motifs that occurred in a given fraction  of the sequences.

 <dig>  motifs were ordered in accordance to the computed statistical significance of the deviation of the number of occurrences observed vs. expected. motifs were considered over-represented in a statistically significant way if the p-value was smaller than 10- <dig> 

 <dig>  a p-value for the likelihood of a uniform distribution of each motif was obtained, using the chi-square bootstrap test, using a significance level, α, equal to  <dig> .

with this analysis, it is possible to define four motif classes, according to their classification in the over-representation and uniformity tests. motifs that are both over-represented and non-uniformly distributed are very likely to have some biological function. our analysis will be centered on these motifs, although, at times, we will also look at motifs that are not seen as strongly over-represented but are distributed in a non-uniform way in the promoter regions.

core promoter elements
for the analysis of the positional distribution of several core promoter elements, a data set containing  <dig> promoter sequences from saccharomyces cerevisiae was considered. this data set includes a significant fraction of the gene promoters for this organism. for eukaryotic species there exists a set of well characterized core promoter elements, that include the tata-box and the gc-box. the documented consensi for these sites are:

• tata-box  <cit> :

 tataa 

• gc-box:  <cit> 

 ggggcgggtatataaat 

following the procedure described, the riso algorithm was instructed to extract simple motifs, with sizes between  <dig> and  <dig>  and a minimum quorum of 20%. table  <dig> shows the results obtained. it is possible to see that almost all the motifs extracted  were classified as being non-uniformly distributed.

from the non-uniform group,  <dig> were classified as over-represented in a statistically significant way. the first ranked motifs in this sub-group correspond to motifs that match previously described consensi. for example, motifs like tataaa, tatata, tatataa, tatatat, and tataaaa match with the tata-box; gggta, and gggcg fit the gc-box profile.

in figure  <dig> it is also possible to observe the positional distribution of a set of motifs that corresponds to the gc-box. the p-values obtained for the uniformity test for these elements are much lower than  <dig> , suggesting non-uniformity and stressing that these motifs have a positional preference.

however, only the tata-box has been classified as over-represented in a statistically significant way. this is a case where the application of a non-uniformity test would identify biologically significant motifs that would go unnoticed by the over-representation tests.

the results obtained for this data set show that most of the extracted motifs are classified as non-uniformly distributed. this result was somehow expected since the motif finder was instructed to extract motifs with a minimum quorum of 20% in a large data set of  <dig> promoter sequences. this means that each motif must be present in at least  <dig> sequences. some of the motifs extracted correspond to known transcription factors binding sites and a large number corresponds to motifs that are important in the context of the chromatin regulation. most of these motifs are known to have a positional preference. in this example, we did not perform a detailed analysis of all the motifs extracted, since they are too numerous. the objective was to identify well characterized motifs that have positional preference and that may not be over-represented in a statistically significant way.

aft2p
this data set contains the promoter regions of  <dig> genes that are documented to be regulated by the transcription factor aft2p. the documented consensus for this tf are the motifs: cgcaccc, ggcaccc, tgcaccc and ykcacccr.

for this data set, riso was instructed to extract simple conserved motifs, with sizes between  <dig> and  <dig>  and a minimum quorum of 50%. table  <dig> presents the number of motifs classified in each of the four classes defined by the combination of the uniformity and over-representation statistical tests.

from a total of  <dig> motifs extracted, only  <dig> are considered to be non-uniform. a set of  <dig> out of these  <dig> are classified as over-represented. this small group includes the motif caccc, which corresponds to the core conserved motif described for this tf binding site. the p-value for the uniformity test for this motif was  <dig> e -  <dig>  the complete consensus that corresponds to this tf binding site was not reported, since this it is only present in a small number of sequences in this data set.

dal80p
this data set includes  <dig> promoter sequences of genes documented to be regulated by the transcription factor dal80p. the biological consensus described consists of two identical motifs, gataag, separated by  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs.

for this data set the motif finder was instructed to extract simple conserved motifs, with sizes between  <dig> and  <dig>  and a minimum quorum of 50%. table  <dig> presents the number of motifs included in each of the four classes.

from a total of  <dig> motifs, only  <dig> are distributed non-uniformly, and only  <dig> of these are over-represented in a statistically significant way. in this group of  <dig> motifs, it is possible to find the gataag motif, which is precisely the motif that corresponds to the biological consensus described. the three other motifs that complete this group are the motifs cttatc, tatata and aagaaa. the first one is the complement of the gataag motif, the second one is a tata-box that, as discussed before, has a positional preference and the last one is a motif already identified in yeast promoters as being one of the pre-mrna 3'-end-processing signals.

gln3p
this data set consists of  <dig> promoter sequences of genes regulated by the transcription factor gln3p. the reported consensi for this tf binding site are the motifs gataag and gattag.

motifs with sizes between  <dig> and  <dig> bases and a minimum quorum of 50% were extracted by the motif finder. table  <dig> presents the number of motifs included in each of the four classes. a total of  <dig> motifs was extracted and classified. from these, only  <dig> show positional preference. in this group,  <dig> were classified as over-represented. in this last group it is possible to find the motif gataag, that corresponds to one of the consensi described as a binding site for this tf. the group also includes motifs that correspond to the general transcription factor tata-box: tatata, atataa and atatat and also the complement of the motif of interest. the second consensus, gattag, was not found in any of the groups. however, in the group of the  <dig> motifs that are not over-represented but are non-uniformly distributed, it is possible to find the motif ctaatc, that corresponds to the complement of this motif. in this case the non-uniformity test may play a key role, if used to distinguish this motif from background noise.

met4p
this data set contains  <dig> promoter sequences of genes that are documented to be regulated by the transcription factor met4p. the documented consensus for this tf binding site is the motif tcacgtg. the motif finder was instructed to extract motifs with sizes between  <dig> and  <dig> bases and a minimum quorum of 50%. table  <dig> presents the results. a total of  <dig> motifs was extracted with these characteristics. from these, only  <dig> were classified as over-represented and non-uniformly distributed. this set of motifs includes the motif cacgtg, the only one that matches the described consensus. the p-value obtained with the uniformity test for this motif was  <dig> e -  <dig>  as expected, motifs related to the tata-box, like the atataa, atatat and tatata, were also among this set of relevant motifs.

gat1p
this data set consists of  <dig> promoter regions of genes that are regulated by the transcription factor gat1p. the consensus sequence of interest is the motif gataag. motifs with sizes between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides and with a minimum quorum of 50% were extracted. table  <dig> shows the results. a total of  <dig> motifs were identified, with only  <dig> being classified as over-represented and non-uniformly distributed. the motif gataag is included in the group of motifs that were classified as non over-represented and uniformly distributed . however, the motif that has been classified as the most over-represented and also non-uniformly distributed was the motif cttatc, that is the complement of the motif of interest. although, the motif gataag is reported as the binding site for the gat1p transcription factor, its reverse can also be considered  <cit> . this reverse motif is particularly relevant if present between positions - <dig> and - <dig>  this position preference is exactly what is observed in this data set. the two other motifs in this category are the motifs tatata and aagaaa, whose biological relevance was already reported in the analysis of the data set dal80p.

datasets for other organisms have also been analyzed, and confirm the obtained results are consisten with the ones presented in this section .

CONCLUSIONS
given these results, we propose that the integration of position uniformity tests and over-representation tests can be used to improve the accuracy of the classification of motifs found by combinatorial motif finders.

the study we performed on the positional distribution of several well known cis-regulatory elements, in the promoter sequences of different organisms, has shown that position conservation is a significant characteristic of many biologically significant motifs. in particular, the results show that many biologically relevant motifs appear heterogeneously distributed in the promoter region of genes, and therefore, that non-uniformity is a good indicator of biological relevance.

in a number of instances where over-representation tests do not provide conclusive results, non-uniformity tests can be used to flag the relevant motifs. this effect is most evident for small motifs, that are expected to appear a large number of times, and for small datasets, where the over-representation tests are not powerful enough to single out motifs that are biologically significant, but are only somewhat over-represented.

in particular, it is clear from the results that motifs that pass both tests are very strong candidates for further analysis. this is an important point, specially for users of combinatorial motif finders, because it is sometimes hard to filter the relevant motifs from the large number of sequences identified by these methods. in fact, currently used over-representation tests are likely either to miss important motifs that are not long enough, or to flag as significant motifs that are over-represented only by chance.

","we conclude that many biologically relevant motifs appear heterogeneously distributed in the promoter region of genes, and therefore, that non-uniformity is a good indicator of biological relevance and can be used to complement over-representation tests commonly used.
using artificial data, we have compared three different statistical tests  to assess whether a given motif occurs uniformly in the promoter region of a gene.
using the test that performed better in this dataset, we proceeded to study the positional distribution of several well known cis-regulatory elements, in the promoter sequences of different organisms .
previous work has highlighted the existence of positional bias of motifs in the dna sequences, which might indicate not only that the pattern is important, but also provide hints of the positions where these patterns occur preferentially.
the results show that position conservation is relevant for the transcriptional machinery.

"BACKGROUND
comparison of long, orthologous dna sequences usually reveals patterns consisting of alternating segments of higher and lower interspecies similarity  <cit> .
many slowly evolving segments are under selective constraint, due to their function as protein-coding exons, utrs, transcription factor binding sites, etc.
in particular, numerous relatively short conservative segments of untranscribed intergenic regions have recently been discovered, and phylogenetic footprinting has been used to study the molecular mechanisms of transcription  <cit> .
however, functionally important dna segments are not always strictly conserved, and can evolve due to a variety of factors, including positive selection  <cit> .
this evolution leads to intraspecies polymorphism, often having significant impacts on function and fitness , and to interspecies divergence.
the known cases of such divergence usually involve presence of a functional binding site for a particular transcription factor in one species and its disruption or total absence in the orthologous sequence segment in the other species.
nucleotide substitutions, as well as short insertions and deletions involving a binding site, can be correlated with interspecies differences in the expression profiles of the corresponding genes  <cit> .
yeast saccharomyces provides a particularly good opportunity to study evolution of functional segments of untranscribed dna.
in s. cerevisiae, and almost certainly in other related species, the promoter of a gene belongs to one of the two distinct classes: class  <dig>  or class  <dig> , with ~13% of all promoters containing a tata box and belonging to class  <dig>  <cit> .
transcription from promoters of the two classes involves recruitment of different complexes of transcription factors  <cit> , and the corresponding genes have rather different expression patterns.
expression of class  <dig> genes tends to change in response to selective pressure and environmental stress more than expression of class  <dig> genes  <cit> .
expression of class  <dig> genes is sensitive to mutations in binding surface of tbp, and their promoters often contain one of the eight variants of the  <dig> nucleotide-long tata box consensus sequence  <cit> .
tata boxes are usually located in the region between  <dig> and  <dig> bp upstream of transcription start site  <cit> .
expression of class  <dig> genes is insensitive to mutations in binding surface of tbp, and their promoters usually lack tata box consensus sequence  <cit> .
thus, evolution of a particular key transcription-related sequence, the tata box, can be studied at the level of the whole yeast genome.
here, we will address the simplest, qualitative aspect of this evolution, the dynamics of switches of the promoter class in the course of interspecies divergence of orthologous genes within saccharomyces sensu stricto group.
RESULTS
class  <dig> and class  <dig> promoters in s. cerevisiae genes
in order to study evolutionary switches of the promoter class, we first need to determine the class of individual genes.
let us start from considering s. cerevisiae genes where, in contrast to other yeast species, this task is facilitated by the available data on gene expression.
our goal is to establish two sets of genes, which unambiguously have class  <dig> or class  <dig> promoters in s. cerevisiae.
although all genes apparently require tbp for expression, only a fraction of genes is sensitive to mutations in dna binding surface of tbp  <cit> , and these genes are inferred to have functional tata boxes  <cit> .
we assume that an orf has a class  <dig> promoter in s. cerevisiae if it meets all of the following stringent criteria:  the upstream region  contains at least one tata box consensus sequence, tataa  <cit> ,  expression of the gene declined substantially  after  <dig> min exposure to at least one of the tata binding defective tbp mutants v71e and v161e  <cit> , and  the location of the orf on the chromosome does not overlap with that of any other orf sensitive to tata binding defective tbp mutants.
these criteria define class  <dig> promoters with the highest possible certainty, as long as only s. cerevisiae sequence is used.
since we are interested in interspecies evolution of tata box, our criteria must use exclusively the data from a single species  and must not depend on interspecies sequence conservation  <cit> .
a total of  <dig>  s. cerevisiae orfs meet these criteria; these are the genes that have class  <dig> promoters with the highest certainty.
conversely, we assume that an orf has a class  <dig> promoter in s. cerevisiae if it meets both of the following criteria:  the extended upstream region  does not contain any of the  <dig> tata box consensus sequences, and  expression of the gene was not affected  by  <dig> min exposure to both tata binding defective tbp mutants v71e and v161e  <cit> .
among  <dig> genes that lack sensitivity to tbp mutations,  <dig>  have a consensus tata box sequence in their upstream regions  and another  <dig> have a consensus tata box sequence in the  region.
this leaves us with  <dig>  s. cerevisiae orfs which meet these criteria; these are the genes that have class  <dig> promoters with the highest certainty.
we concentrate on these two extreme classes of genes which very likely have class  <dig> or class  <dig> promoters and ignore the rest of the s. cerevisiae genes.
indeed, we have to focus on the extremes because they provide the strongest data sets.
class  <dig> and class  <dig> promoters in non-cerevisiae yeast genes
for the remaining  <dig> species of saccharomyces sensu stricto group, there are no data on gene expression.
thus, we have to rely on sequences alone.
we attribute to class  <dig> all the non-cerevisiae genes which carry at least one of the  <dig> tata box consensus sequences in the  region.
dealing with class  <dig>  we need to take into account that in s. cerevisiae a large fraction of genes sensitive to tbp binding defective mutations  do not carry any of the  <dig> variants of the consensus tata box sequences even in the extended upstream region .
however, most of such genes  carry a sequence differing by just one nucleotide from one of the variants.
therefore, some non-cerevisiae octanucleotides which are orthologous to a s. cerevisiae tata box sequence but deviate at a single nucleotide site from the consensus still may function as tata boxes, and the corresponding promoters may belong to class  <dig>  conversely, we assume that octanucleotides differing from each of the  <dig> tata box consensus variants at two or more nucleotide sites do not function as tata boxes, and attribute non-cerevisiae genes carrying only such sequences in their  regions to class  <dig>
promoter class switches between s. cerevisiae and other four species
generally, within the  <dig> sets of orthologous genes which very likely have class  <dig> promoters in s. cerevisiae, the putative tata sites are strongly conserved, well above the level of conservation of surrounding sequence .
however,  <dig>  of these genes lack a tata box sequence  in one or more of the other four species from saccharomyces sensu stricto group .
in these  <dig> genes, s. cerevisiae tata box was aligned, in at least one of the non-cerevisiae species, either to an octanucleotide differing in more than one nucleotide from the consensus tata box sequence, or to a gap .
promoters of  <dig> genes lack tata box sequence in two or more non-cerevisiae species.
the fraction of genes with missing tata boxes is the lowest in s. paradoxus, the species most closely related to s. cerevisiae .
in  <dig> genes , tata box is present in s. bayanus, but its position differs from that in s. cerevisiae, and octanucleotides orthologous, in the cerevisiae-bayanus alignment, to both tata boxes species differ by more than one nucleotide from the  <dig> consensus variants .
a for non-conserved tata boxes, the minimal number of nucleotides different from the consensus sequence of tata box a) is shown in parentheses.
""gap"" indicates an alignment gap at the site of the tata box; ""ga"" means that orf was not present in the given species.
b parsimonious number of switch events in sensu stricto group; i.e., the minimum number of mutations within sensu stricto group necessary to produce this pattern.
the number of events is unknown for orf ypr119w due to lack of data for s. kudriavtsevii.
c inferred state in last common ancestor.
in cases when more than one equally parsimonious ancestral state was possible, it could not be inferred reliably .
a number of events per time required for the accumulation of one nucleotide substitution at a non-coding site.
the average number of substitutions per nucleotide site in intergenic regions, relative to s. cerevisiae, is  <dig>  in s. paradoxus,  <dig>  in s. mikatae,  <dig>  in s. kudriavtsevii, and  <dig>  in s. bayanus.
among the  <dig> genes which very likely have class  <dig> promoters in s. cerevisiae, in  <dig>  the consensus tata sequence is present in  in one or more of the four non-cerevisiae yeast species.
in  <dig> of these genes, it is present in two or more species , and in  <dig> genes, it is present in all four species, providing strong support for its function as a tata box in non-cerevisiae species.
a the minimal distance from tata consensus is the minimal number of nucleotides different from the consensus sequence a) in the octanucleotide of s. cerevisiae which is orthologous to the tata box in the non-cerevisiae species.
""gap"" indicates an alignment gap at the site of the tata box; ""ga"" means that orf was not conserved in the given species.
b parsimonious number of switch events in sensu stricto group; i.e., the minimum number of mutations within sensu stricto group necessary to produce this pattern.
c inferred state in last common ancestor.
in cases when more than one equally parsimonious ancestral state was possible, it could not be inferred reliably .
the known yeast phylogeny makes it possible to infer the promoter class of a gene in the last common ancestor of the s. sensu stricto group from the observed pattern of tata box presence/absence in the five orthologs.
also, it is possible to use parsimony to infer the minimum number of promoter class switches  during the evolution of s. sensu stricto group species from their last common ancestor.
in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> genes  which underwent switches of the promoter class, there was more than one switch .
genes with promoters which switched their class between species are to some extent different from other genes of the corresponding class.
the  <dig> class  <dig>  genes that switched class are generally expressed weaker in s.cerevisiae  than the remaining class  <dig> genes.
the  <dig> class  <dig>  genes that switched class are less sensitive to tbp mutations in s. cerevisiae  than the remaining class  <dig> genes.
since  <dig>  genes that lack sensitivity to tbp mutations in s. cerevisiae, have a consensus tata box sequence in their  regions, even a perfect tata box consensus may, nevertheless, fail to function as a tata box, perhaps due to its broader sequence context.
conservation of such ""spurious"" tata boxes between s. cerevisiae and other yeast species was substantially lower than for functional tata boxes , and only slightly exceeded conservation of neighboring sequences ).
the upstream regions of these  <dig> genes tend to be less conserved than that of the tbp-mutation-sensitive genes .
discussion
the sequence of the upstream region of a gene is not sufficient to determine the class of its promoter with perfect certainty.
some genes with expression profiles of class  <dig> genes nevertheless lack precise tata boxes, and some genes with expression profiles of class  <dig> genes contain precise tata boxes.
perhaps, sequences which deviate substantially from the tata box consensus may act as tata boxes in some class  <dig> genes, and tata boxes in some class  <dig> genes are spurious.
alternatively, data on expression profiles of some genes might be problematic.
thus, at this point, we can regard class  <dig> genes as tata-containing, and class  <dig> genes as non-tata-containing, only with some degree of uncertainty.
in the absence of the experimental data on gene expression in non-cerevisiae yeasts, our conclusions must be treated with caution, especially when applied to individual genes.
our results suggest that even within the relatively short evolutionary times separating saccharomyces species, a substantial fraction of genes underwent as major a transition as switching of the class of their promoters.
at least  <dig> % of all genes went through a switch of the promoter between the classes  <dig> and  <dig> at least once during the evolution of saccharomyces sensu stricto group.
this figure takes into account only the small fraction of genes for which we can determine the promoter class with the highest certainty.
extrapolated to the whole genome, this figure suggests that ~11% of genes change the class of their promoters in the course of sensu stricto group divergence.
among genes belonging to class  <dig> in s. cerevisiae, the switch between promoter classes  occurred at the rate of one per time during which eight to twenty substitutions occurred at a non-coding nucleotide site .
conversely, among class  <dig> genes in s. cerevisiae, switches between promoter classes  occur at the rate of one per time during which three to ten substitutions occurred at a non-coding nucleotide site .
finally, at the rate of less than one per  <dig> nucleotide substitutions, the position of a tata box shifted within the upstream region of a class  <dig> gene .
the observed switches of promoter class cannot be due to sequencing errors.
for example, a switch from class  <dig> in s. cerevisiae to class  <dig> in a non-cerevisiae yeast involves at least two nucleotide substitutions within the  <dig> nucleotide-long tata box.
such switches were observed for 8% of tata boxes, which would require a clearly impossible sequencing error rate >10- <dig>
our estimates of the frequency of promoter class switches may be too low, for several reasons.
first, we used very conservative definitions of class  <dig> and class  <dig> promoters.
for the former, we required the presence of a tata box within a narrow segment of the gene upstream region, and a significant reduction of the gene expression in tbp mutants.
in reality, functional tata boxes may be present in a broader region  <cit> , and may be less sensitive to tbp mutations  <cit> ; the latter is in fact the case for two of the genes experimentally known to contain a functional tata box – gal <dig> and adh <dig>  <cit> .
by limiting ourselves to the genes with the strongest response to mutation in tbp, we may be choosing a slowly evolving subset of tata-containing genes.
however, expression of genes with class  <dig> promoters can evolve rapidly in experiments  <cit> , so that the real pattern may be more complex.
second, for a fraction of the analyzed genes, we were unable to find the ortholog in another species.
since the five species considered are closely related, this can be due to the quality of the draft sequence.
in reality, some of these yet undiscovered orthologous genes could have switched the classes of their promoters as well, and the rate of promoter type evolution inferred from better-quality genome sequences might be higher.
finally, our requirement of a change of two nucleotides in the ortholog of a tata box may sometimes be too stringent, since a single nucleotide substitution is often sufficient to disrupt a functional tata box  <cit>  therefore, the higher rate of promoter class switches inferred for the genes insensitive to tbp mutations with class  <dig> promoters in s. cerevisiae may reflect the actual rate of evolution better than the reciprocal rate.
the abundance of genes showing multiple events of promoter class switching during the evolution of saccharomyces suggests heterogeneity of intrinsic switch rates among genes.
in the genes with elevated rate of promoter class switching, tata box can be under reduced selective constraint, or subject to fluctuating positive selection  <cit> .
CONCLUSIONS
by combining expression data on s. cerevisiae genes with sequence data from four closely related yeast species, we were able to ascertain the set of genes that probably changed the class of their promoters, and several genes in which the functional tata box changed its position in the upstream region of the gene.
experimental data on non-cerevisiae genes are necessary to confirm our analysis for each individual gene.
however, our results suggest that a substantial number of genes underwent promoter class switching between the closely related species of saccharomyces genus.
",44,"BACKGROUND
comparison of long, orthologous dna sequences usually reveals patterns consisting of alternating segments of higher and lower interspecies similarity  <cit> . many slowly evolving segments are under selective constraint, due to their function as protein-coding exons, utrs, transcription factor binding sites, etc. in particular, numerous relatively short conservative segments of untranscribed intergenic regions have recently been discovered, and phylogenetic footprinting has been used to study the molecular mechanisms of transcription  <cit> .

however, functionally important dna segments are not always strictly conserved, and can evolve due to a variety of factors, including positive selection  <cit> . this evolution leads to intraspecies polymorphism, often having significant impacts on function and fitness , and to interspecies divergence. the known cases of such divergence usually involve presence of a functional binding site for a particular transcription factor in one species and its disruption or total absence in the orthologous sequence segment in the other species. nucleotide substitutions, as well as short insertions and deletions involving a binding site, can be correlated with interspecies differences in the expression profiles of the corresponding genes  <cit> .

yeast saccharomyces provides a particularly good opportunity to study evolution of functional segments of untranscribed dna. in s. cerevisiae, and almost certainly in other related species, the promoter of a gene belongs to one of the two distinct classes: class  <dig>  or class  <dig> , with ~13% of all promoters containing a tata box and belonging to class  <dig>  <cit> . transcription from promoters of the two classes involves recruitment of different complexes of transcription factors  <cit> , and the corresponding genes have rather different expression patterns. expression of class  <dig> genes tends to change in response to selective pressure and environmental stress more than expression of class  <dig> genes  <cit> . expression of class  <dig> genes is sensitive to mutations in binding surface of tbp, and their promoters often contain one of the eight variants of the  <dig> nucleotide-long tata box consensus sequence  <cit> . tata boxes are usually located in the region between  <dig> and  <dig> bp upstream of transcription start site  <cit> . expression of class  <dig> genes is insensitive to mutations in binding surface of tbp, and their promoters usually lack tata box consensus sequence  <cit> .

thus, evolution of a particular key transcription-related sequence, the tata box, can be studied at the level of the whole yeast genome. here, we will address the simplest, qualitative aspect of this evolution, the dynamics of switches of the promoter class in the course of interspecies divergence of orthologous genes within saccharomyces sensu stricto group.

","BACKGROUND
phylogenetic conservation at the dna level is routinely used as evidence of molecular function, under the assumption that locations and sequences of functional dna segments remain invariant in evolution. in particular, short dna segments participating in initiation and regulation of transcription are often conserved between related species. however, transcription of a gene can evolve, and this evolution may involve changes of even such conservative dna segments. genes of yeast saccharomyces have promoters of two classes, class  <dig>  and class  <dig> .

hc-toxin is a host-selective toxin that endows the pathogenic fungus cochliobolus carbonum with exceptional virulence on maize varieties that lack a functional copy of hm <dig> and/or hm <dig>  both of which encode a carbonyl reductase that detoxifies hc-toxin  <cit> .
a minority of natural isolates of c. carbonum, designated race  <dig>  make hc-toxin  <cit> .
only maize lines of genotype hm1/hm <dig>  hm2/hm <dig> are sensitive to hc-toxin and hence susceptible to race  <dig> isolates of c. carbonum.

like hc-toxin, apicidin is a cyclic tetrapeptide containing a d-imino acid and an l-amino acid with an aliphatic r-group .
the gene cluster responsible for apicidin biosynthesis has been characterized, and many of the genes of the apicidin gene cluster have as their closest known homologs the genes of tox <dig>  including hts <dig>  toxa, toxe, and toxf <cit> .
during a screen for new hdac inhibitors, a new species of alternaria  that produces hc-toxin was discovered  <cit> .
a. jesenskae was isolated from seeds of fumana procumbens, a shrubby perennial with a wide geographic distribution, but it is not known if a. jesenskae is pathogenic.
a situation in which two fungi in different genera produce the same compound is unusual and presents an opportunity to explore the evolution of a complex secondary metabolite, especially one with a strong evolutionary impact on the cereals.
here we document the identification and characterization of the genes for hc-toxin biosynthesis in a. jesenskae.
RESULTS
alternaria jesenskae produces hc-toxin
an isolate of a. jesenskae was obtained and its taxonomic identity confirmed by sequencing of the its regions  <cit> .
culture filtrates of a. jesenskae were fractionated by reverse phase hplc.
no particular peak was seen at the retention time of hc-toxin , but fractions with the same retention time as native hc-toxin contained an epoxide-containing compound with the same rf on tlc as hc-toxin .
the mass of this compound was determined to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , compared to a calculated mass of  <dig>  for a compound with the elemental composition of hc-toxin   <cit> .
these results confirm the observation that a. jesenskae makes hc-toxin.
alternaria jesenskae has unmistakable orthologs of the tox <dig> genes
the genome of a. jesenskae was determined to ~10× coverage by pyrosequencing followed by assembly.
using blastn and tblastn, strongly related sequences of each of the known seven tox <dig> genes from c. carbonum were found in the genome of a. jesenskae .
these will be collectively referred to as ajtox <dig>  southern blotting of a. jesenskae dna cut with diagnostic restriction enzymes indicated that all of the seven known tox <dig> genes except perhaps ajtoxc were present in at least two copies in the genome of a. jesenskae , as they are in c. carbonum <cit> .
the values in the columns headed “c.
carbonum” are the identities between the genes and proteins of c. carbonum and a. jesenskae, and the values in the columns headed “a.
jesenskae” are the identities between the two copies within a. jesenskae, when relevant.
abecause of the impossibility of resolving both copies of hts <dig> in c. carbonum, only one copy is included.
the hc-toxin biosynthetic genes of a. jesenskae
ajhts1- non-ribosomal peptide synthetase
hc-toxin synthetase  in c. carbonum is a 5218-amino acid nrps encoded by a  <dig> -kb open reading frame.
it contains four modules with one epimerase domain between modules  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> .
blastn and tblastn indicated numerous and overlapping contigs related to hts <dig> in a. jesenskae.
following computational and manual assembly, the complete sequence of ajhts <dig> was deduced.
the encoded nrps contains  <dig> amino acids, four modules, and an epimerase domain between modules  <dig> and  <dig>  a. jesenskae contains at least two copies of ajhts <dig>  but it was not always possible to deduce which contig was derived from which copy.
ajhts <dig> and hts <dig> of c. carbonum share 84%  and 82%  identity , which is higher than either one to any other nrps in the genbank or jgi databases.
like hts <dig>  ajhts <dig> has no predicted introns.
ajtoxa – major facilitator superfamily  transporter
both blastn and tblastn identified at least six contigs, some overlapping, with strong homology to toxa of c. carbonum.
the ajtoxa contigs were manually aligned and assembled, revealing that a. jesenskae has at least two copies of toxa , although by southern blotting there may be as many as four .
using ajtoxa as the search query against the genbank and jgi databases, toxa gave the strongest hit , followed by aps <dig> from fusarium incarnatum , and then a predicted mfs transporter from pyrenophora tritici-repentis .
the two copies of ajtoxa share 95%  and 94%  identity with each other.
ajtoxa and toxa each have four exons in almost the same positions .
the two characterized copies of ajtoxa are clustered with the two copies of ajhts <dig>  similar to toxa and hts <dig> in c. carbonum .
the two genes are transcribed from opposite strands, and the predicted atg start sites of the two genes are  <dig> nucleotides apart.
in c. carbonum, the two start codons are separated by  <dig> nucleotides  <cit> .
the nucleotide sequences of the four introns share 64% overall identity between the two species.
ajtoxc - fatty acid synthase beta subunit
toxc in c. carbonum is predicted to encode a fatty acid synthase beta subunit.
it is required for hc-toxin biosynthesis, probably for the biosynthesis of the decanoic acid backbone of aeo  <cit> .
fungal fatty acid synthases are oligomers of alpha and beta subunits.
a predicted alpha subunit gene, called toxh, is clustered with the other genes of tox <dig> in c. carbonum but has not yet been functionally characterized .
the apicidin cluster of f. incarnatum and the hypothetical hc-toxin clusters of p. tritici-repentis and s. turcica  contain an alpha subunit gene, but, inexplicably, the clusters in neither of these two fungi, nor in f. incarnatum, which makes apicidin, contain a ortholog of toxc <cit> .
there are three copies of toxc in c. carbonum <cit> .
however, only one copy of ajtoxc was unambiguously identified in a. jesenskae.
ajtoxc shares 83%  and 78%  identity with toxc .
ajtoxc has a single intron of  <dig> bp, and toxc has a single intron of  <dig> bp .
the best tblastn hit of ajtoxc in genbank was toxc.
ajtoxd , ajtoxf , and ajtoxg
blastn, tblastn, and southern blot analyses indicated that a. jesenskae has at least two copies each of toxd, toxf, and toxg.
these three genes are 81-86%  and 81-85%  identical to the corresponding genes in c. carbonum .
gene structures were experimentally verified by sequencing 5’ and 3’ race products.
the intron/exon structures of all ajtox <dig> genes are highly similar to c. carbonum .
these three genes are clustered together on two distinct contigs in a. jesenskae .
the arrangements of the genes within each contig are different in a. jesenskae and c. carbonum.
in c. carbonum, toxf and toxg are clustered within ~ <dig> bp , while at least  <dig> kb separates toxd from toxf and toxg in c. carbonum <cit> .
toxd expression is regulated with the other genes of tox <dig> by the transcription factor toxe, but its disruption gave no detectable hc-toxin or virulence phenotype .
toxf is required for hc-toxin production and is predicted to encode a member of the branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase family  <cit> .
although its precise biochemical function is unknown, a plausible function of toxf is to aminate a precursor of aeo, e.g., the fatty acid product of toxc and toxh.
the function of toxg has been established as an alanine racemase  <cit> .
toxg is a member of the pyridoxal-containing serine hydroxymethyl transferase superfamily  <cit> .
ajtoxe- hc-toxin-specific transcription factor
toxe encodes a transcription factor that regulates the known genes of tox <dig> in c. carbonum <cit> .
it contains a bzip dna binding domain at its n terminus and four ankyrin repeats at its c-terminus  <cit> .
c. carbonum strain sb <dig> has two copies of toxe, one clustered with the other tox <dig> genes and one on a separate chromosome.
in other strains, both copies of toxe are on the same chromosome  <cit> .
a. jesenskae also has two copies of ajtoxe on two separate contigs, but it is not known if these contigs are on the same or different chromosomes.
within a. jesenskae the two copies of ajtoxe are 85%  and 76%  identical .
this is a lower degree of identity than for any of the other copies of the ajtox <dig> genes to each other.
the two copies average 61% amino acid identity between c. carbonum and a. jesenskae .
this degree of conservation between toxe and ajtoxe is lower than for any of the other tox <dig> proteins .
in c. carbonum, toxe binds to promoters of the tox <dig> genes containing the “tox box” motif, atctcncgna  <cit> .
analysis of the contigs containing the ajtox <dig> genes indicates the probable presence of similar motifs in their putative promoter regions .
however, their location in relation to the genes themselves is unclear at this time, because the transcriptional start sites of the ajtox <dig> genes have not been experimentally verified.
relative relatedness of housekeeping proteins and the tox <dig> proteins between c. carbonum and a. jesenskae
the percent amino acid identity of the proteins of tox <dig> and ajtox <dig> range from 58%  to 85% , with an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % .
in order to put this degree of relatedness in evolutionary context, we calculated the degree of amino acid identity of a set of housekeeping proteins common to most or all dothideomycetes.
the genes chosen for comparison were ones that have been characterized in c. carbonum and for which full-length orthologs were found in the partial a. jesenskae genome survey.
the four housekeeping proteins ranged in identity from 76% to 96%, with an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % .
this is slightly more conserved than the tox <dig> genes, but this difference is not statistically significant.
virulence of a. jesenskae
hc-toxin is an established virulence factor for c. carbonum, but any possible adaptive advantage it might confer on a. jesenskae is unknown.
although a. jesenskae was isolated from seeds of fumana procumbens , it is not known if a. jesenskae is a pathogen of f. procumbens or any other plant.
however, a number of species of alternaria are plant pathogens, and specific secondary metabolites  are critical determinants of the host range and high virulence of some species and strains of this genus  <cit> .
in order to test whether hc-toxin has a virulence function in a. jesenskae, several plant species were inoculated with it.
in arabidopsis, a wild type line , a pad <dig> mutant, which has enhanced susceptibility to alternaria brassicicola <cit> , and a quadruple della mutant, which also shows enhanced susceptibility to necrotrophic pathogens such as a. brassicicola <cit> , were tested.
in no case case did a. jesenskae cause any visible symptoms of disease .
a. jesenskae also failed to produce any symptoms on cabbage  or on maize of genotypes hm1/hm <dig> or hm1/hm <dig> .
possible explanations for the failure of a. jesenskae to colonize hm1/hm <dig> maize is that it cannot penetrate the leaves or that it does not produce hc-toxin while growing on maize.
a. jesenskae was also tested for pathogenicity on f. procumbens seedlings.
under conditions of high humidity, profuse saprophytic growth was observed and most of the plants died by week  <dig> .
in some experiments, some minor symptoms of disease  at inoculation sites were observed, but the symptoms did not progress and host death did not result.
therefore, we conclude that a. jesenskae is probably not a foliar plant pathogen.
discussion
this report confirms that a. jesenskae produces hc-toxin , a cyclic peptide originally found in cochliobolus carbonum.
a genome survey sequence of a. jesenskae indicated that this fungus has high-scoring orthologs of all of the known genes involved in hc-toxin biosynthesis from c. carbonum.
the orthologs are much more closely related to each other than to any other genes or proteins in genbank or jgi.
the degree of identity makes it highly probable that these are the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of hc-toxin in a. jesenskae.
intron/exon structures are also highly conserved between the two fungi.
it is highly unlikely that the production of hc-toxin by these two fungi evolved by convergent evolution.
in both a. jesenskae and c. carbonum the genes for hc-toxin biosynthesis are mostly duplicated and organized into a loose genomic cluster.
in both fungi, the copies of toxa are immediately adjacent to the two copies of hts <dig> and transcribed divergently.
some of the other genes are also clustered, but differently in the two organisms.
in both fungi the multiple copies of toxf and toxg are tightly clustered, but whereas in c. carbonum all copies of toxd are at least  <dig> kb distant from these two genes, in a. jesenskae both copies of toxd are clustered with these two genes.
differences in gene order in clusters making the same metabolite in different fungi has been reported .
further conclusions about the organization of the ajtox <dig> genes could not be deduced based on the partial genome sequence.
likewise, a full picture of the structure of tox <dig> of c. carbonum has not been possible due to its size, the gene duplications, and a high density of repeated elements  <cit> .
in regard to an explanation for how two distinct species evolved the same biosynthetic machinery to synthesize the same complex secondary metabolite, there are two salient factors to consider.
first, alternaria and cochliobolus are closely related genera in the pleosporaceae  <cit> .
second, among plant pathogenic fungi, alternaria and cochliobolus are the major producers of known secondary metabolite host-selective toxins  <cit> .
the host-selective toxins of alternaria show a pattern of disjunct taxonomic distribution similar to the cochliobolus host-selective toxins, i.e., production of a particular hst is typically restricted to specific strains  or species.
compared to other groups of fungi, these two genera appear to have a particularly dynamic capacity to acquire new secondary metabolite potential, which they have successfully exploited to colonize new plant pathogenic niches.
the mechanistic basis of the generation of the extraordinary metabolic diversity in cochliobolus and alternaria, and more generally in the filamentous fungi, is not clear.
the most plausible explanations are horizontal gene transfer and/or gene duplication followed by rapid divergence and rapid loss.
horizontal gene transfer has become increasingly accepted as an explanation for many examples of disjunct distribution of secondary metabolites and their genes.
clustering of pathway genes, a common observation, would facilitate horizontal transfer, and trans-species hyphal fusion provides a mechanism of dna transfer  <cit> .
horizontal transfer is neither supported nor refuted by the example of hc-toxin described in this paper, because the two genera are so closely related.
it is equally plausible that a common ancestor of alternaria and cochliobolus produced hc-toxin, and this trait was lost from most of the species in the two genera.
it is now possible to correlate genes and metabolites for three cyclic tetrapeptides of the hc-toxin family in three fungal species.
a. jesenskae and c. carbonum both make hc-toxin, and their orthologous nrps genes are 82% identical.
f. incarnatum makes a chemically related molecule, apicidin, and its cognate nrps  is 44% identical to hts <dig>  the known genes in common among the three pathways are hts <dig>  toxa, toxc, toxd, toxf, and toxe.
apicidin does not contain any d amino acids besides d-proline , whose production from l-proline is presumably catalyzed by the epimerase domain of aps <dig>  and therefore an alanine racemase  is not needed for its biosynthesis  <cit> .
the tox <dig> cluster of c. carbonum contains a gene for a fatty acid synthase beta subunit  and one for the alpha subunit .
the apicidin cluster does not contain a beta subunit gene.
either apicidin biosynthesis uses the housekeeping beta subunit, or, more likely, the gene for the dedicated beta subunit is elsewhere in the genome.
the family of cyclic peptides related to hc-toxin has seven members   <cit> .
the biosynthetic genes for the other members have not yet been characterized.
besides horizontal transfer, rapid duplication, divergence, and loss is another possible explanation for much of the observed taxonomic complexity in secondary metabolite chemistry and gene cluster structure and organization in fungi , and glomerella cingulata .
the first four fungi are in the dothideomycetes and the second two are in the sordariomycetes.
genes with reasonable amino acid identity and structure  are not present in any other fungus including other species of cochliobolus and fusarium.
toxe showed the lowest percent amino acid identity between c. carbonum and a. jesenskae  of any of the tox <dig> proteins, and the next best ortholog  shares only 32% amino acid identity.
that these are all true orthologs can be deduced by the strong conservation of the bzip dna binding region at the n terminus, the ankyrin repeats at the c terminus, and by the fact that aps <dig> has an experimentally determined role in regulating the biosynthesis of a secondary metabolite chemically similar to hc-toxin  <cit> .
apparently, the specific amino acid sequence of most of the toxe protein is not essential for its activity.
this is reminiscent of the transcription factor aflr in aspergillus flavus and a. nidulans; the two proteins are functional orthologs despite only 33% amino acid identity  <cit> .
aps <dig> is required for expression of the apicidin biosynthetic genes  <cit> , but the functions of the other toxe orthologs are not known.
in p. tritici-repentis, g. cingulata, and s. turcica, the toxe orthologs  are immediately adjacent to four-module nrps genes, suggesting that the toxe orthologs in these fungi have a role in regulating secondary metabolite production like they do in c. carbonum and f. incarnatum <cit> .
are there orthologs of the tox <dig> genes in other fungi?
recently, two other fungi in the pleosporaceae, p. tritici-repentis and s. turcica, were reported to have the hts <dig> gene  <cit> .
this conclusion was based on the presence of a four-module nrps clustered with genes similar to toxd, toxa, and toxe.
putative orthologs of toxc, toxd, and toxg were found elsewhere in the genomes of these two fungi.
however, it seems unlikely that these clusters are true orthologs of tox <dig> for several reasons.
first, these fungi have not been shown to make hc-toxin, and this possibility seems unlikely considering that they have been studied extensively by plant pathologists.
second, closest proximity on a phylogenetic tree does not necessarily signify that any two genes are true orthologs instead of paralogs, because in the case of taxonomically highly disjunct genes , there is no way to know how many closer orthologs actually exist among all isolates of all species in the tree.
third, the products of the individual genes of tox <dig> and the putative orthologs in s. turcica and p. tritici-repentis do not have very high amino acid identity.
orthologs of housekeeping genes in these fungi have higher amino acid identity.
a particular pitfall of assigning orthology among secondary metabolite genes whose biochemical functions are unknown is that many of them belong to broad classes of proteins that are distributed widely, being present not only in many different secondary metabolite clusters but often also having a role in primary metabolism.
for example, all fungi will typically have multiple genes encoding mfs transporters , fatty acid synthases , short chain alcohol dehydrogenases , and aminotransferases .
without functional evidence, it is hazardous to attempt to associate such genes to particular secondary metabolite gene clusters within a genome.
toxg  serves as an example of the difficulty of identifying true orthology in fungal secondary metabolite gene clusters.
the putative orthologs of toxg in p. tritici-repentis and s. turcica are not clustered with the other genes of the putative hc-toxin cluster, and they are only 44% identical at the amino acid level to toxg of c. carbonum.
this level of identity is too low to confidently assign biochemical function, because toxg is a member of a pyridoxal-dependent superfamily that includes enzymes with many different functions involved in both primary and secondary metabolism  <cit> .
toxg itself has high amino acid identity to threonine aldolase and would have been reasonably annotated as such if experimental evidence had not indicated its true function  <cit> .
therefore, without evidence that the putative orthologs of toxg in s. turcica and p. tritici-repentis encode alanine racemases, or at least amino acid racemases, the most parsimonious interpretation is that these genes have other, unrelated functions.
the tox2-like clusters in s. turcica and p. tritici-repentis probably do encode genes for the biosynthesis of cyclic tetrapeptides with at least one d amino acid  and one amino acid with an aliphatic side chain .
based on the high amino acid identity among their members, the two “tox2” clusters of s. turcica and p. tritici-repentis are probably true orthologs to each other, i.e., responsible for producing the same or a closely related metabolite, which has not yet been identified.
disjunct taxonomic distribution between species vs. disjunct distribution within species
some secondary metabolites are present in phylogenetically disparate taxa, and others are present only in certain isolates of a single species.
the distribution of hc-toxin shows both patterns: only a minority of natural isolates of c. carbonum produce it  <cit> , yet, as shown in this paper, its production crosses generic boundaries.
there are many documented cases of secondary metabolites being found in taxonomically unrelated species, but examples of metabolites restricted to particular isolates of a species are less common.
this is probably because few fungal secondary metabolites have been studied at the population level, the host-selective toxins being an exception because of their agricultural importance and because their production is easy to score using differential plant genotypes.
other known examples of secondary metabolites with a role in plant/pathogen interactions that are present in different genera include pm-toxin/t-toxin and fumonisins.
pm-toxin and t-toxin are closely related  linear polyketides made by didymella zeae-maydis  and cochliobolus heterostrophus, respectively.
both of these fungi are in the dothideomycetes  <cit> .
fumonisins are polyketide mycotoxins found in fusarium verticillioides  and aspergillus niger .
the evidence suggests that horizontal gene transfer contributed to the extant distribution of fumonisins  <cit> .
CONCLUSIONS
the results in this paper show that hc-toxin is made by at least one fungus outside the genus cochliobolus.
the genes involved in its biosynthesis are highly conserved between the two fungi.
this situation could have arisen by horizontal gene transfer.
alternatively, it could have arisen by vertical transmission from a common ancestor, in which case the trait has been lost from other species of alternaria and cochliobolus.

many secondary metabolites play important ecological roles in the interactions between microbes and other organisms. some, such as the host-selective toxins, are virulence factors for plant pathogenic fungi  <cit> . two genera, cochliobolus and alternaria, both in the pleosporaceae of the dothideomycetes, have particularly exploited this strategy to increase their pathogenic fitness and to extend their host range to new species and strains of crop plants ranging from cereals  to dicotyledonous plants   <cit> .

abecause of the impossibility of resolving both copies of hts <dig> in c. carbonum, only one copy is included.

the hc-toxin biosynthetic genes of a. jesenskae
ajhts1- non-ribosomal peptide synthetase 
hc-toxin synthetase  in c. carbonum is a 5218-amino acid nrps encoded by a  <dig> -kb open reading frame. it contains four modules with one epimerase domain between modules  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . blastn and tblastn indicated numerous and overlapping contigs related to hts <dig> in a. jesenskae. following computational and manual assembly, the complete sequence of ajhts <dig> was deduced. the encoded nrps contains  <dig> amino acids, four modules, and an epimerase domain between modules  <dig> and  <dig>  a. jesenskae contains at least two copies of ajhts <dig>  but it was not always possible to deduce which contig was derived from which copy. ajhts <dig> and hts <dig> of c. carbonum share 84%  and 82%  identity , which is higher than either one to any other nrps in the genbank or jgi databases. like hts <dig>  ajhts <dig> has no predicted introns.

ajtoxa – major facilitator superfamily  transporter
both blastn and tblastn identified at least six contigs, some overlapping, with strong homology to toxa of c. carbonum. the ajtoxa contigs were manually aligned and assembled, revealing that a. jesenskae has at least two copies of toxa , although by southern blotting there may be as many as four . using ajtoxa as the search query against the genbank and jgi databases, toxa gave the strongest hit , followed by aps <dig> from fusarium incarnatum , and then a predicted mfs transporter from pyrenophora tritici-repentis . the two copies of ajtoxa share 95%  and 94%  identity with each other. ajtoxa and toxa each have four exons in almost the same positions .

toxc in c. carbonum is predicted to encode a fatty acid synthase beta subunit. it is required for hc-toxin biosynthesis, probably for the biosynthesis of the decanoic acid backbone of aeo  <cit> . fungal fatty acid synthases are oligomers of alpha and beta subunits. a predicted alpha subunit gene, called toxh, is clustered with the other genes of tox <dig> in c. carbonum but has not yet been functionally characterized . the apicidin cluster of f. incarnatum and the hypothetical hc-toxin clusters of p. tritici-repentis and s. turcica  contain an alpha subunit gene, but, inexplicably, the clusters in neither of these two fungi, nor in f. incarnatum, which makes apicidin, contain a ortholog of toxc <cit> .

there are three copies of toxc in c. carbonum <cit> . however, only one copy of ajtoxc was unambiguously identified in a. jesenskae. ajtoxc shares 83%  and 78%  identity with toxc . ajtoxc has a single intron of  <dig> bp, and toxc has a single intron of  <dig> bp . the best tblastn hit of ajtoxc in genbank was toxc.

ajtoxd , ajtoxf , and ajtoxg 
blastn, tblastn, and southern blot analyses indicated that a. jesenskae has at least two copies each of toxd, toxf, and toxg. these three genes are 81-86%  and 81-85%  identical to the corresponding genes in c. carbonum . gene structures were experimentally verified by sequencing 5’ and 3’ race products. the intron/exon structures of all ajtox <dig> genes are highly similar to c. carbonum .

these three genes are clustered together on two distinct contigs in a. jesenskae . the arrangements of the genes within each contig are different in a. jesenskae and c. carbonum. in c. carbonum, toxf and toxg are clustered within ~ <dig> bp , while at least  <dig> kb separates toxd from toxf and toxg in c. carbonum <cit> .

toxd expression is regulated with the other genes of tox <dig> by the transcription factor toxe, but its disruption gave no detectable hc-toxin or virulence phenotype . toxf is required for hc-toxin production and is predicted to encode a member of the branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase family  <cit> . although its precise biochemical function is unknown, a plausible function of toxf is to aminate a precursor of aeo, e.g., the fatty acid product of toxc and toxh.

the function of toxg has been established as an alanine racemase  <cit> . toxg is a member of the pyridoxal-containing serine hydroxymethyl transferase superfamily  <cit> .

ajtoxe- hc-toxin-specific transcription factor
toxe encodes a transcription factor that regulates the known genes of tox <dig> in c. carbonum <cit> . it contains a bzip dna binding domain at its n terminus and four ankyrin repeats at its c-terminus  <cit> . c. carbonum strain sb <dig> has two copies of toxe, one clustered with the other tox <dig> genes and one on a separate chromosome. in other strains, both copies of toxe are on the same chromosome  <cit> . a. jesenskae also has two copies of ajtoxe on two separate contigs, but it is not known if these contigs are on the same or different chromosomes. within a. jesenskae the two copies of ajtoxe are 85%  and 76%  identical . this is a lower degree of identity than for any of the other copies of the ajtox <dig> genes to each other. the two copies average 61% amino acid identity between c. carbonum and a. jesenskae . this degree of conservation between toxe and ajtoxe is lower than for any of the other tox <dig> proteins .

in c. carbonum, toxe binds to promoters of the tox <dig> genes containing the “tox box” motif, atctcncgna  <cit> . analysis of the contigs containing the ajtox <dig> genes indicates the probable presence of similar motifs in their putative promoter regions . however, their location in relation to the genes themselves is unclear at this time, because the transcriptional start sites of the ajtox <dig> genes have not been experimentally verified.

relative relatedness of housekeeping proteins and the tox <dig> proteins between c. carbonum and a. jesenskae
the percent amino acid identity of the proteins of tox <dig> and ajtox <dig> range from 58%  to 85% , with an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . in order to put this degree of relatedness in evolutionary context, we calculated the degree of amino acid identity of a set of housekeeping proteins common to most or all dothideomycetes. the genes chosen for comparison were ones that have been characterized in c. carbonum and for which full-length orthologs were found in the partial a. jesenskae genome survey. the four housekeeping proteins ranged in identity from 76% to 96%, with an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . this is slightly more conserved than the tox <dig> genes, but this difference is not statistically significant.

virulence of a. jesenskae
hc-toxin is an established virulence factor for c. carbonum, but any possible adaptive advantage it might confer on a. jesenskae is unknown. although a. jesenskae was isolated from seeds of fumana procumbens , it is not known if a. jesenskae is a pathogen of f. procumbens or any other plant. however, a number of species of alternaria are plant pathogens, and specific secondary metabolites  are critical determinants of the host range and high virulence of some species and strains of this genus  <cit> .

in order to test whether hc-toxin has a virulence function in a. jesenskae, several plant species were inoculated with it. in arabidopsis, a wild type line , a pad <dig> mutant, which has enhanced susceptibility to alternaria brassicicola <cit> , and a quadruple della mutant, which also shows enhanced susceptibility to necrotrophic pathogens such as a. brassicicola <cit> , were tested. in no case case did a. jesenskae cause any visible symptoms of disease . a. jesenskae also failed to produce any symptoms on cabbage  or on maize of genotypes hm1/hm <dig> or hm1/hm <dig> . possible explanations for the failure of a. jesenskae to colonize hm1/hm <dig> maize is that it cannot penetrate the leaves or that it does not produce hc-toxin while growing on maize. a. jesenskae was also tested for pathogenicity on f. procumbens seedlings. under conditions of high humidity, profuse saprophytic growth was observed and most of the plants died by week  <dig> . in some experiments, some minor symptoms of disease  at inoculation sites were observed, but the symptoms did not progress and host death did not result. therefore, we conclude that a. jesenskae is probably not a foliar plant pathogen.

discussion
this report confirms that a. jesenskae produces hc-toxin , a cyclic peptide originally found in cochliobolus carbonum. a genome survey sequence of a. jesenskae indicated that this fungus has high-scoring orthologs of all of the known genes involved in hc-toxin biosynthesis from c. carbonum. the orthologs are much more closely related to each other than to any other genes or proteins in genbank or jgi. the degree of identity makes it highly probable that these are the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of hc-toxin in a. jesenskae. intron/exon structures are also highly conserved between the two fungi. it is highly unlikely that the production of hc-toxin by these two fungi evolved by convergent evolution.

in both a. jesenskae and c. carbonum the genes for hc-toxin biosynthesis are mostly duplicated and organized into a loose genomic cluster. in both fungi, the copies of toxa are immediately adjacent to the two copies of hts <dig> and transcribed divergently. some of the other genes are also clustered, but differently in the two organisms. in both fungi the multiple copies of toxf and toxg are tightly clustered, but whereas in c. carbonum all copies of toxd are at least  <dig> kb distant from these two genes, in a. jesenskae both copies of toxd are clustered with these two genes. differences in gene order in clusters making the same metabolite in different fungi has been reported . further conclusions about the organization of the ajtox <dig> genes could not be deduced based on the partial genome sequence. likewise, a full picture of the structure of tox <dig> of c. carbonum has not been possible due to its size, the gene duplications, and a high density of repeated elements  <cit> .

in regard to an explanation for how two distinct species evolved the same biosynthetic machinery to synthesize the same complex secondary metabolite, there are two salient factors to consider. first, alternaria and cochliobolus are closely related genera in the pleosporaceae  <cit> . second, among plant pathogenic fungi, alternaria and cochliobolus are the major producers of known secondary metabolite host-selective toxins  <cit> . the host-selective toxins of alternaria show a pattern of disjunct taxonomic distribution similar to the cochliobolus host-selective toxins, i.e., production of a particular hst is typically restricted to specific strains  or species. compared to other groups of fungi, these two genera appear to have a particularly dynamic capacity to acquire new secondary metabolite potential, which they have successfully exploited to colonize new plant pathogenic niches.

the mechanistic basis of the generation of the extraordinary metabolic diversity in cochliobolus and alternaria, and more generally in the filamentous fungi, is not clear. the most plausible explanations are horizontal gene transfer and/or gene duplication followed by rapid divergence and rapid loss. horizontal gene transfer has become increasingly accepted as an explanation for many examples of disjunct distribution of secondary metabolites and their genes. clustering of pathway genes, a common observation, would facilitate horizontal transfer, and trans-species hyphal fusion provides a mechanism of dna transfer  <cit> . horizontal transfer is neither supported nor refuted by the example of hc-toxin described in this paper, because the two genera are so closely related. it is equally plausible that a common ancestor of alternaria and cochliobolus produced hc-toxin, and this trait was lost from most of the species in the two genera.

it is now possible to correlate genes and metabolites for three cyclic tetrapeptides of the hc-toxin family in three fungal species. a. jesenskae and c. carbonum both make hc-toxin, and their orthologous nrps genes are 82% identical. f. incarnatum makes a chemically related molecule, apicidin, and its cognate nrps  is 44% identical to hts <dig>  the known genes in common among the three pathways are hts <dig>  toxa, toxc, toxd, toxf, and toxe. apicidin does not contain any d amino acids besides d-proline , whose production from l-proline is presumably catalyzed by the epimerase domain of aps <dig>  and therefore an alanine racemase  is not needed for its biosynthesis  <cit> . the tox <dig> cluster of c. carbonum contains a gene for a fatty acid synthase beta subunit  and one for the alpha subunit . the apicidin cluster does not contain a beta subunit gene. either apicidin biosynthesis uses the housekeeping beta subunit, or, more likely, the gene for the dedicated beta subunit is elsewhere in the genome. the family of cyclic peptides related to hc-toxin has seven members   <cit> . the biosynthetic genes for the other members have not yet been characterized.

besides horizontal transfer, rapid duplication, divergence, and loss is another possible explanation for much of the observed taxonomic complexity in secondary metabolite chemistry and gene cluster structure and organization in fungi , and glomerella cingulata . the first four fungi are in the dothideomycetes and the second two are in the sordariomycetes. genes with reasonable amino acid identity and structure  are not present in any other fungus including other species of cochliobolus and fusarium.

toxe showed the lowest percent amino acid identity between c. carbonum and a. jesenskae  of any of the tox <dig> proteins, and the next best ortholog  shares only 32% amino acid identity. that these are all true orthologs can be deduced by the strong conservation of the bzip dna binding region at the n terminus, the ankyrin repeats at the c terminus, and by the fact that aps <dig> has an experimentally determined role in regulating the biosynthesis of a secondary metabolite chemically similar to hc-toxin  <cit> . apparently, the specific amino acid sequence of most of the toxe protein is not essential for its activity. this is reminiscent of the transcription factor aflr in aspergillus flavus and a. nidulans; the two proteins are functional orthologs despite only 33% amino acid identity  <cit> .

aps <dig> is required for expression of the apicidin biosynthetic genes  <cit> , but the functions of the other toxe orthologs are not known. in p. tritici-repentis, g. cingulata, and s. turcica, the toxe orthologs  are immediately adjacent to four-module nrps genes, suggesting that the toxe orthologs in these fungi have a role in regulating secondary metabolite production like they do in c. carbonum and f. incarnatum <cit> .

are there orthologs of the tox <dig> genes in other fungi?
recently, two other fungi in the pleosporaceae, p. tritici-repentis and s. turcica, were reported to have the hts <dig> gene  <cit> . this conclusion was based on the presence of a four-module nrps clustered with genes similar to toxd, toxa, and toxe. putative orthologs of toxc, toxd, and toxg were found elsewhere in the genomes of these two fungi. however, it seems unlikely that these clusters are true orthologs of tox <dig> for several reasons. first, these fungi have not been shown to make hc-toxin, and this possibility seems unlikely considering that they have been studied extensively by plant pathologists. second, closest proximity on a phylogenetic tree does not necessarily signify that any two genes are true orthologs instead of paralogs, because in the case of taxonomically highly disjunct genes , there is no way to know how many closer orthologs actually exist among all isolates of all species in the tree. third, the products of the individual genes of tox <dig> and the putative orthologs in s. turcica and p. tritici-repentis do not have very high amino acid identity. orthologs of housekeeping genes in these fungi have higher amino acid identity.

a particular pitfall of assigning orthology among secondary metabolite genes whose biochemical functions are unknown is that many of them belong to broad classes of proteins that are distributed widely, being present not only in many different secondary metabolite clusters but often also having a role in primary metabolism. for example, all fungi will typically have multiple genes encoding mfs transporters , fatty acid synthases , short chain alcohol dehydrogenases , and aminotransferases . without functional evidence, it is hazardous to attempt to associate such genes to particular secondary metabolite gene clusters within a genome.

toxg  serves as an example of the difficulty of identifying true orthology in fungal secondary metabolite gene clusters. the putative orthologs of toxg in p. tritici-repentis and s. turcica are not clustered with the other genes of the putative hc-toxin cluster, and they are only 44% identical at the amino acid level to toxg of c. carbonum. this level of identity is too low to confidently assign biochemical function, because toxg is a member of a pyridoxal-dependent superfamily that includes enzymes with many different functions involved in both primary and secondary metabolism  <cit> . toxg itself has high amino acid identity to threonine aldolase and would have been reasonably annotated as such if experimental evidence had not indicated its true function  <cit> . therefore, without evidence that the putative orthologs of toxg in s. turcica and p. tritici-repentis encode alanine racemases, or at least amino acid racemases, the most parsimonious interpretation is that these genes have other, unrelated functions.

the tox2-like clusters in s. turcica and p. tritici-repentis probably do encode genes for the biosynthesis of cyclic tetrapeptides with at least one d amino acid  and one amino acid with an aliphatic side chain . based on the high amino acid identity among their members, the two “tox2” clusters of s. turcica and p. tritici-repentis are probably true orthologs to each other, i.e., responsible for producing the same or a closely related metabolite, which has not yet been identified.

disjunct taxonomic distribution between species vs. disjunct distribution within species
some secondary metabolites are present in phylogenetically disparate taxa, and others are present only in certain isolates of a single species. the distribution of hc-toxin shows both patterns: only a minority of natural isolates of c. carbonum produce it  <cit> , yet, as shown in this paper, its production crosses generic boundaries. there are many documented cases of secondary metabolites being found in taxonomically unrelated species, but examples of metabolites restricted to particular isolates of a species are less common. this is probably because few fungal secondary metabolites have been studied at the population level, the host-selective toxins being an exception because of their agricultural importance and because their production is easy to score using differential plant genotypes.

other known examples of secondary metabolites with a role in plant/pathogen interactions that are present in different genera include pm-toxin/t-toxin and fumonisins. pm-toxin and t-toxin are closely related  linear polyketides made by didymella zeae-maydis  and cochliobolus heterostrophus, respectively. both of these fungi are in the dothideomycetes  <cit> . fumonisins are polyketide mycotoxins found in fusarium verticillioides  and aspergillus niger . the evidence suggests that horizontal gene transfer contributed to the extant distribution of fumonisins  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the results in this paper show that hc-toxin is made by at least one fungus outside the genus cochliobolus. the genes involved in its biosynthesis are highly conserved between the two fungi. this situation could have arisen by horizontal gene transfer. alternatively, it could have arisen by vertical transmission from a common ancestor, in which case the trait has been lost from other species of alternaria and cochliobolus.

","the encoded orthologous proteins share 75-85% amino acid identity, and the genes for hc-toxin biosynthesis are duplicated in both fungi.
a set of representative housekeeping proteins show a similar high level of amino acid identity between c. carbonum and a. jesenskae, which is consistent with the close relatedness of these two genera within the family pleosporaceae .
hc-toxin, a cyclic tetrapeptide, is a virulence determinant for the plant pathogenic fungus cochliobolus carbonum.
the major genes  involved in the biosynthesis of hc-toxin were identified from a. jesenskae by genomic sequencing.
the genes may have moved by horizontal transfer between the two species, but it cannot be excluded that they were present in a common ancestor and lost from other species of alternaria and cochliobolus.
it was recently discovered that another fungus, alternaria jesenskae, also produces hc-toxin.
this is the first report that the plant virulence factor hc-toxin is made by an organism other than c. carbonum.

"BACKGROUND
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies  or prion diseases comprise a group of neurodegenerative diseases that include bovine spongiform encephalopathy  in cattle, scrapie in sheep, and creutzfeldt-jakob disease  in humans
<cit> .
prion diseases are associated with the conversion of the cellular prion protein  into a pathogenic isoform
<cit> .
aggregation of prpsc in neurons coincides with neuronal decay that finally leads to neurodegeneration.
the molecular mechanism underlying prion-induced metabolic changes within infected cells are still poorly understood
<cit> .
several lines of evidence indicate that imbalances in the homeostasis of cholesterol are linked to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders including prion diseases
<cit> .
membrane-bound cholesterol is essential for the localization of prpc in lipid rafts and for the formation of prpsc <cit> .
inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis reduces the formation of prpsc and prolongs the survival time of scrapie-infected mice
<cit> .
cell culture models have been widely used to identify molecules that link cholesterol synthesis to prpsc formation
<cit> .
prion infected neuroblastoma cells upregulate a number of genes, among others hmg-coa synthase , hmg-coa reductase , ipp isomerase , and the sterol regulatory element binding factor  <dig> , that are involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.
in addition, expression of the low density lipoprotein -receptor is enhanced and leads to an increased uptake of cholesterol after prion infection
<cit> .
both, uptake and synthesis of cholesterol
<cit>  as well as maintenance of hepatic function
<cit>  are essentially influenced by the action of micrornas .
mirnas are potent regulators of gene expression that can act on the posttranscriptional level.
these on average  <dig> nt long non-protein coding rnas are derived from primary transcripts  that are sequentially processed into their mature form by the rnase iii type nucleases drosha and dicer
<cit> .
the mature mirnas are sequestered into rna-induced silencing complexes  and recruit complementary mrnas that, as a result, are degraded or translationally repressed
<cit> .
evidence accumulates that mirnas are also involved in most neurodegenerative disorders that include parkinsonism
<cit> , huntington’s chorea
<cit> , alzheimer’s disease
<cit> , and also prion disease
<cit> .
since mirnas reduce the transcript levels of their target mrnas on a genome-wide scale
<cit> , the parallel examination of a mirnome and a transcriptome combined with a mirna target analysis can be used to identify mirna:mrna interaction partners.
this so-called “genome-wide joint profiling” has been successfully applied to identify pathologically relevant mirna:mrna interactions in alzheimer’s disease
<cit>  and neuronal hiv-infection
<cit> .
in the present study we applied joint profiling to prion-infected neuronal cell cultures.
using ultra-deep sequencing we obtained several millions of small rna sequence reads.
stringent filtering, co-expression and target analysis identified nine mirnas that showed multiple targets in cholesterol-dependent mrnas.
four of those mirnas, namely mmu-mir- <dig>  mmu-mir- <dig>  mmu-mir-503*, and mmu-mir-542-5p, are clustered in a mirna dense region on the mouse x-chromosome.
our results show that joint profiling of mirna and mrna is an effective approach to identify relevant mirna:mrna candidate pairs that could be used for functional studies in prion-induced dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis.
methods
rna extraction
the mouse neuroblastoma cell line n2a  was cultured and sibling clones were infected in parallel with brain homogenate from scrapie-infected mice  or from healthy controls as previously described
<cit> .
after the 18th passage rna was extracted with the rneasy mini kit .
the integrity of the rna samples was determined by capillary electrophoresis on a bioanalyzer  according to the supplier’s instructions.
the rna concentration was determined photometrically at  <dig> nm on a nanodrop  and  <dig> μg of each sample were applied to ultra-deep sequencing.
ultra-deep sequencing of small rnas
construction of cdna libraries, cluster generation and subsequent ultra-deep sequencing on a solexa/illumina platform was performed at the allan wilson centre genome service , new zealand.
in brief,  <dig> μg of total rna from each sample was size-fractionated by 15% polyacrylamide electrophoresis .
the small rna fraction ) was extracted and ligated to 5’- and 3’-rna adaptors using t <dig> rna ligase.
the rna-adaptor constructs were purified and reverse transcribed.
clusters were generated by hybridization of the samples to the flow cell, chemical conversion to ssdna, blocking of the 3’-oh and hybridization of sequencing primers.
ultra-deep sequencing was performed using one flow cell channel per sample.
bioinformatic analyses
compression of library data was achieved by annotating the frequency of each unique sequence into its respective identifier, thereby removing multiple reads in fasta format.
sequences with a frequency < <dig> were discarded.
both preprocessing steps were implemented as perl scripts and led to a speed-up of all further computations by a factor of about  <dig>  processed libraries were aligned to mirbase release  <dig>  with ncbi blast  using standard settings without dust filter .
identification of mirnas by blast required perfect alignment over the total mirna length minus a tolerance offset of  <dig> nt.
mirna target sites in the 3’-utr of murine mrnas srebf <dig>  hgmcr, hgmcs <dig>  mvk, idi <dig>  fdft <dig>  cyp <dig>  sc4mol, and ldlr were predicted using miranda  with the following parameter settings: minimum score  <dig>  minimum free energy − <dig> kcal/mol, conservation off, scaling parameter  <dig>  gap open penalty − <dig> , gap extend penalty − <dig> .
ribosomal 28s, 18s,  <dig> s and 5s rrnas were blasted against mirbase release  <dig> .
mirna profiling by quantitative real-time pcr
ten ng of total rna from scrapie- and mock-infected n2a cells were reverse transcribed .
the relative expression levels of mmu-mir- <dig>  mmu-mir-503*, mmu-mir- <dig> and mmu-mir-542-5p was determined in a stem-loop based quantitative real-time pcr  assay  according to the supplier's instructions.
cycling was performed after initial denaturation for  <dig> min at 95°c for  <dig> cycles with 95°c for  <dig> sec and 60°c for  <dig> sec in a  <dig> real time pcr system .
relative expression levels were calculated according to the ΔΔct-method
<cit>  using the non-regulated mirna hsa-mir-106b* as a housekeeping rna.
statistical significance was determined by two way anova with bonferroni post test .
RESULTS
in the present study we applied joint profiling to prion-infected neuronal cell cultures.
therefore we performed co-expression analysis of mirnas and mrnas combined with a stringent mirna target prediction to identify relevant mirna:mrna pairs.
this combined approach will be referred to as joint profiling.
reliable joint profiling by a direct comparison of mirna and mrna expression data depends on the use of identical samples for both studies.
thus we have used the prion-infected neuroblastoma n2a cell model that had been generated for whole genome transcriptome profiling
<cit> .
in brief, the n2a cells were infected in parallel with brain homogenate derived from terminally ill mice infected with the scrapie strain  <dig> l  or from mock-infected healthy mice  as previously reported
<cit> .
we then extracted total rna from scn2a and n2a-mock cells.
to confirm high quality rna we conducted nano-scale electrophoresis that showed a high rna integrity number  of  <dig>  and  <dig>  in both samples, respectively.
the recent development of high-throughput sequencing technologies  allows for the comprehensive recording of all nucleic acid sequences in virtually any biological sample.
we decided to use the solexa platform that is especially suitable for mirna analysis due to its immense capacity to generate high numbers of short sequence reads with high accuracy.
to achieve the highest possible sensitivity both samples were enriched for small rnas with a cut-off range from  <dig> to  <dig> nt.
to further increase the sequencing depth  we used one capillary per sample with a capacity of approximately  <dig> million base pairs.
our ultra-deep sequencing analysis resulted in the generation of  <dig>  x  <dig> and  <dig>  x  <dig> sequence reads from scn2a and n2a-mock cells, respectively.
for the generation of mirna profiles from these libraries, successive filtering and normalization steps were implemented .
as a first step, compression of data was achieved by merging of identical sequence reads and encoding their frequency into the respective sequence identifier.
since the population of small rnas must be expected to include mrna degradation products with limited significance
<cit>  we increased the specificity of our dataset by exclusion of rare sequences.
we arbitrarily applied a cut-off for reads with a frequency < <dig>  it should be noted that this stringent cut-off results in loss of information, but is required to reduce the expected false positive rate.
identification of all expressed murine mirnas in our samples was achieved by annotation of the filtered dataset to the mirbase  <dig> .
our blast analysis allowed up to three mismatches at the 5’- or 3’-end of each mirna, respectively.
although this leads to loss of specificity regarding closely related mirnas, it enabled the identification of mirna-processing variants that differ from the mirbase entries
<cit> .
to date, several mirnas have been removed from mirbase due to the fact that the sequences were identical to ribosomal rnas , e.g.
mir- <dig> and hsa-mir- <dig> from mirbase release  <dig>  .
to ensure that our dataset would not include such rrna-derived sequences, we did an additional blast analysis that compared the entire murine mirbase dataset with mouse 28s, 18s, 5s and  <dig> s rrna ncbi entries.
we found that  <dig> mirnas appeared to be rrna fragments and thus were removed from our analysis.
most, but not all of these rrna fragments were also described by others
<cit>  and have meanwhile been deleted from mirbase.
however, mmu-mir- <dig> and mmu-mir- <dig> are identical to ribosomal sequences and still valid in the current mirbase release  <dig>
after this successive filtering we identified  <dig> mirnas expressed in mock-infected and  <dig> expressed in scrapie-infected n2a cells, which collectively correspond to  <dig> individual mirnas .
for the identification of regulated mirnas, the libraries derived from scrapie-infected and mock-infected cells needed to be normalized.
the normalization of ultra deep sequencing data has been reported to be a crucial step in interpreting regulation
<cit> .
parameswaran and colleagues have described two alternative methods,  the normalization to total small rnas sequenced for each library or  the normalization against the total number of mirnas in the respective samples.
applying both normalization methods to our filtered datasets we obtained similar results .
however, normalization against the total number of mirnas bears the risk of creating a bias in case that a high proportion of mirnas is regulated.
therefore we chose to normalize against the total number of sequence reads.
next we aimed to identify mirnas that were differentially expressed in scrapie-infected cells as compared to mock-infected controls.
regulation of mirnas was considered to be robust if the relative abundance differed at least twofold between both libraries.
using this analysis strategy we found  <dig> upregulated and seven downregulated mirnas in addition to a number of mirnas that were solely expressed in scn2a or n2a-mock cells.
since we had restricted our analysis to sequences that had been read more than ten times, we filtered the solely expressed mirnas for those that were detected more than  <dig> times to reach the criterion of twofold regulation.
six mirnas from n2a-mock cells matched this criterion and were termed “downregulated” without assigning a specific regulation factor.
the resulting  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated mirnas with their corresponding sequence reads are listed in table
<dig>
it is known that the upregulation of mirnas results in the downregulation of their specific target genes.
vice versa, downregulation of mirnas could lead to the upregulation mrna levels, presumably by a de-repression mechanism
<cit> .
accordingly, some or all of the  <dig> downregulated mirnas may be responsible for the upregulation of those mrnas that induce prion-associated disturbance of cholesterol homeostasis.
in the light of these considerations we conducted a mirna target search.
we examined the 3’-utrs of the cholesterogenic mouse genes  for putative binding sites for the  <dig> downregulated mirnas.
four out of  <dig> mirnas were not predicted to bind any of the nine target genes.
however, nine mirnas showed multiple targets in at least one of these mrnas .
interestingly, four of those mirnas, namely mmu-mir- <dig>  mmu-mir- <dig>  mmu-mir-503*, and mmu-mir-542-5p are located in a genomic cluster within  <dig> kb on the mouse x-chromosome.
we next validated the regulation of the mirnas from this cluster  by qrt-pcr.
for normalization we used the mmu-mir-106b* as a housekeeping mirna, presuming that it was expressed at constant and robustly high levels.
using a commercial kit, mmu-mir- <dig> was not detected by qrt-pcr analysis.
to provide comparability among the quantification of the different mirnas we did not modify the recommended protocol of the commercial detection kit in order to achieve detection of mmu-mir- <dig>  in comparison, mmu-mir-503* could be detected, however, we could not confirm regulation.
the fact that in ultra-deep sequencing the number of sequence reads and the upregulation factors were both at the borderline may have prevented the robust detection of mir-503*-regulation by qrt-pcr.
however, the regulation of the more abundantly expressed mirnas mmu-mir- <dig> and −542-5p was confirmed by qrt-pcr, indicating to a high validity of the ultra-deep sequencing .
furthermore the magnitude of downregulation in scrapie-infected versus mock-infected cells of mmu-mir- <dig> and mmu-mir-542-5p was comparable to that estimated by ultra-deep sequencing.
in summary, our joint profiling approach lead to the identification of two mirna candidates that correlate with disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis in prion-infected cells.

discussion
ultra-deep sequencing represents a powerful technology for the comprehensive assessment of the whole mirnome in a given sample in a presumably unbiased manner.
using solexa technology we have generated five million independent short sequence reads per sample.
highly abundant mirnas, such as mmu-let-7c, mmu-mir- <dig>  and mmu-mir-99b were sequenced on average  <dig>  times.
this corresponds to an enhanced sensitivity of three orders of magnitude in comparison to traditional cloning and subsequent sanger sequencing strategies in early pioneer studies
<cit> .
since high sensitivity mostly results in reduced specificity we used a panel of stringent filters to identify mirnas that were robustly expressed.
contemporaneously we could exclude fragments derived from ribosomal rna that were misleadingly annotated as mirnas in mirbase  <dig> .
the high specificity of our approach is reflected by the detection of more than  <dig>  sequence reads of the neuronally expressed paralogues mir-103/107
<cit>  and mir30a/d
<cit> , whereas liver-enriched mir- <dig> was not expressed in n2a cells.
this is in accordance with previous studies that did not detect significant amounts of these mirnas in the brain
<cit> .
ultra-deep sequencing data can be used for relative quantification, but the resulting accuracy is strictly dependent on the used scaling method
<cit> .
we have normalized our mirnas expression profiles to the respective library size as suggested
<cit> .
to ensure the applicability of this normalization method to identify regulated mirnas we performed qrt-pcr.
by comparison of these two independent methods we could confirm downregulation of mmu-mirs − <dig> and −542-5p.
furthermore, the observed differences in mirna expression were consistent, regardless whether they were determined by uds or qrt-pcr, although significant regulation of one mirna could not be confirmed.
it was recently reported that murine mmu-mirna-146a is upregulated in scrapie
<cit> , and bse-infected
<cit>  mice.
mir-146a can be activated upon lps treatment via toll-like receptors tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  upon overexpression, mmu-mir-146a modulates transcription of genes involved in cell movement and adhesion, mediators of inflammation and a set of genes involved in rna post-transcriptional regulation
<cit> .
comparison of n2a vs scn2a cells revealed a  <dig>  fold upregulation of mmu-mir-146a that failed to match our criteria for further analysis.
this is similar to the regulation upon bse-infection in macaques
<cit> .
it may also reflect the specificity of certain micrornas in rare human prion diseases that was recently reported
<cit> .
our approach revealed  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated mirnas in scn2a cells as compared to mock-infected controls.
the downregulated mirnas were used as queries for target analysis to identify mutual mirna:mrna interaction partners that might be responsible for prion-associated induction of cholesterol synthesis.
linking a mirna to its downstream targets is a major challenge in mirna biology and only few mirna:mrna pairs have been experimentally confirmed yet.
a variety of bioinformatic algorithms have been developed which predict potential binding sites within the 3’-untranslated regions  of mrnas
<cit> .
some, but not all limitations of mirna target predictions are caused by the inaccuracy of the underlying algorithm.
identification of relevant mirna:mrna pairs can also fail if one, the mirna or the mrna, is not present in the relevant cell or tissue.
using our mirna expression profile and the known mrna expression profile of the n2a cells we could strongly limit the assumed production of false positive or false negative results.
we used the miranda algorithm
<cit>  to predict putative binding sites of the downregulated mirnas in the 3’-utrs of prion-induced mrnas related to cholesterol homeostasis
<cit> .
four downregulated mirnas could not be linked to the upregulated cholesterogenic genes.
these mirnas have neither been described to be involved in cholesterol homeostasis nor in prion disease.
however, nine out of the  <dig> downregulated mirnas were predicted to have at least one target site in the 3’-utr of the examined mrnas.
notably four of these mirnas reside within a  <dig> kb cluster on the mouse x-chromosome.
to our knowledge, this is the first time that this cluster is correlated to neurogenic cholesterol metabolism.
a putative function of the homologous microrna cluster in humans has been recently described.
the concerted regulation of cluster-derived mirnas promoted cell cycle arrest and differentiation in myocytes
<cit>  and in monocytes
<cit> .
co-expression of clustered mirnas that results in cooperative function has been discovered in several biological systems such as development
<cit> , stem cell differentiation
<cit> , or viral infection
<cit> .
interestingly we also identified two upregulated mirnas, mmu-mir-883a-3p and mmu-mir-743b-5p, that were localized on a second x-chromosomal cluster.
additional five mirnas that reside in this cluster did not match our stringent criteria, but were upregulated more than  <dig>  fold.
whether regulation of these clusters is a cause or a consequence of prion infection remains unknown.
n2a is a polyploid cell line with a mean number of chromosomes around  <dig> and an unstable chromosomal content upon passaging and even within the same culture
<cit> .
whether or not the expression of the x-chromosomal mirna cluster is also influenced by the used cell culture conditions cannot be estimated.
it should be noted that the expression of mirnas are highly cell- and tissue-specific.
thus differences in mirna expression between prion-infected and non-infected n2a cells may not reflect mirna dysregulation in brains of prion-diseased mice or humans.
consequently, the question whether our findings may also have an indication for human prion diseases cannot be answered by our study.
however, since imbalances in neuronal cholesterol homeostasis plays a pivotal role in several human neurodegenerative diseases, including alzheimer's disease
<cit> , huntington’s chorea
<cit> , and niemann pick disease type c
<cit>  our results may be useful to elucidate the mechanism that underlies cholesterol dysregulation.
future studies that will focus on the identification of putative targets of mir- <dig> and mir-542-5p need to be carried out to reinforce the significance of our results.
CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a number of regulated mirnas in a cell culture model for prion diseases by the use of ultra-deep sequencing.
using a joint profiling approach we found that the x-chromosomal clustered mmu-mirs- <dig> and 542-5p could target genes that are involved in prion-induced dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis.
our results show that semi-quantitative analysis of ultra-deep sequencing data is capable to identify differentially regulated mirnas from biological samples.

",754,"BACKGROUND
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies  or prion diseases comprise a group of neurodegenerative diseases that include bovine spongiform encephalopathy  in cattle, scrapie in sheep, and creutzfeldt-jakob disease  in humans
 <cit> . prion diseases are associated with the conversion of the cellular prion protein  into a pathogenic isoform 
 <cit> . aggregation of prpsc in neurons coincides with neuronal decay that finally leads to neurodegeneration. the molecular mechanism underlying prion-induced metabolic changes within infected cells are still poorly understood
 <cit> .

several lines of evidence indicate that imbalances in the homeostasis of cholesterol are linked to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders including prion diseases
 <cit> . membrane-bound cholesterol is essential for the localization of prpc in lipid rafts and for the formation of prpsc <cit> . inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis reduces the formation of prpsc and prolongs the survival time of scrapie-infected mice
 <cit> . cell culture models have been widely used to identify molecules that link cholesterol synthesis to prpsc formation
 <cit> . prion infected neuroblastoma cells upregulate a number of genes, among others hmg-coa synthase , hmg-coa reductase , ipp isomerase , and the sterol regulatory element binding factor  <dig> , that are involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. in addition, expression of the low density lipoprotein -receptor is enhanced and leads to an increased uptake of cholesterol after prion infection
 <cit> .

both, uptake and synthesis of cholesterol
 <cit>  as well as maintenance of hepatic function
 <cit>  are essentially influenced by the action of micrornas . mirnas are potent regulators of gene expression that can act on the posttranscriptional level. these on average  <dig> nt long non-protein coding rnas are derived from primary transcripts  that are sequentially processed into their mature form by the rnase iii type nucleases drosha and dicer
 <cit> . the mature mirnas are sequestered into rna-induced silencing complexes  and recruit complementary mrnas that, as a result, are degraded or translationally repressed
 <cit> . evidence accumulates that mirnas are also involved in most neurodegenerative disorders that include parkinsonism
 <cit> , huntington’s chorea
 <cit> , alzheimer’s disease
 <cit> , and also prion disease
 <cit> .

since mirnas reduce the transcript levels of their target mrnas on a genome-wide scale
 <cit> , the parallel examination of a mirnome and a transcriptome combined with a mirna target analysis can be used to identify mirna:mrna interaction partners. this so-called “genome-wide joint profiling” has been successfully applied to identify pathologically relevant mirna:mrna interactions in alzheimer’s disease
 <cit>  and neuronal hiv-infection
 <cit> .

in the present study we applied joint profiling to prion-infected neuronal cell cultures. using ultra-deep sequencing we obtained several millions of small rna sequence reads. stringent filtering, co-expression and target analysis identified nine mirnas that showed multiple targets in cholesterol-dependent mrnas. four of those mirnas, namely mmu-mir- <dig>  mmu-mir- <dig>  mmu-mir-503*, and mmu-mir-542-5p, are clustered in a mirna dense region on the mouse x-chromosome. our results show that joint profiling of mirna and mrna is an effective approach to identify relevant mirna:mrna candidate pairs that could be used for functional studies in prion-induced dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis.

methods
rna extraction
the mouse neuroblastoma cell line n2a  was cultured and sibling clones were infected in parallel with brain homogenate from scrapie-infected mice  or from healthy controls as previously described
 <cit> . after the 18th passage rna was extracted with the rneasy mini kit . the integrity of the rna samples was determined by capillary electrophoresis on a bioanalyzer  according to the supplier’s instructions. the rna concentration was determined photometrically at  <dig> nm on a nanodrop  and  <dig> μg of each sample were applied to ultra-deep sequencing.

ultra-deep sequencing of small rnas
construction of cdna libraries, cluster generation and subsequent ultra-deep sequencing on a solexa/illumina platform was performed at the allan wilson centre genome service , new zealand. in brief,  <dig> μg of total rna from each sample was size-fractionated by 15% polyacrylamide electrophoresis . the small rna fraction ) was extracted and ligated to 5’- and 3’-rna adaptors using t <dig> rna ligase. the rna-adaptor constructs were purified and reverse transcribed. clusters were generated by hybridization of the samples to the flow cell, chemical conversion to ssdna, blocking of the 3’-oh and hybridization of sequencing primers. ultra-deep sequencing was performed using one flow cell channel per sample.

bioinformatic analyses
compression of library data was achieved by annotating the frequency of each unique sequence into its respective identifier, thereby removing multiple reads in fasta format. sequences with a frequency < <dig> were discarded. both preprocessing steps were implemented as perl scripts and led to a speed-up of all further computations by a factor of about  <dig>  processed libraries were aligned to mirbase release  <dig>  with ncbi blast  using standard settings without dust filter . identification of mirnas by blast required perfect alignment over the total mirna length minus a tolerance offset of  <dig> nt. mirna target sites in the 3’-utr of murine mrnas srebf <dig>  hgmcr, hgmcs <dig>  mvk, idi <dig>  fdft <dig>  cyp <dig>  sc4mol, and ldlr were predicted using miranda  with the following parameter settings: minimum score  <dig>  minimum free energy − <dig> kcal/mol, conservation off, scaling parameter  <dig>  gap open penalty − <dig> , gap extend penalty − <dig> . ribosomal 28s, 18s,  <dig> s and 5s rrnas were blasted against mirbase release  <dig> .

mirna profiling by quantitative real-time pcr
ten ng of total rna from scrapie- and mock-infected n2a cells were reverse transcribed . the relative expression levels of mmu-mir- <dig>  mmu-mir-503*, mmu-mir- <dig> and mmu-mir-542-5p was determined in a stem-loop based quantitative real-time pcr  assay  according to the supplier's instructions. cycling was performed after initial denaturation for  <dig> min at 95°c for  <dig> cycles with 95°c for  <dig> sec and 60°c for  <dig> sec in a  <dig> real time pcr system . relative expression levels were calculated according to the ΔΔct-method
 <cit>  using the non-regulated mirna hsa-mir-106b* as a housekeeping rna. statistical significance was determined by two way anova with bonferroni post test .

RESULTS
in the present study we applied joint profiling to prion-infected neuronal cell cultures. therefore we performed co-expression analysis of mirnas and mrnas combined with a stringent mirna target prediction to identify relevant mirna:mrna pairs. this combined approach will be referred to as joint profiling. reliable joint profiling by a direct comparison of mirna and mrna expression data depends on the use of identical samples for both studies. thus we have used the prion-infected neuroblastoma n2a cell model that had been generated for whole genome transcriptome profiling
 <cit> . in brief, the n2a cells were infected in parallel with brain homogenate derived from terminally ill mice infected with the scrapie strain  <dig> l  or from mock-infected healthy mice  as previously reported
 <cit> . we then extracted total rna from scn2a and n2a-mock cells. to confirm high quality rna we conducted nano-scale electrophoresis that showed a high rna integrity number  of  <dig>  and  <dig>  in both samples, respectively.

the recent development of high-throughput sequencing technologies  allows for the comprehensive recording of all nucleic acid sequences in virtually any biological sample. we decided to use the solexa platform that is especially suitable for mirna analysis due to its immense capacity to generate high numbers of short sequence reads with high accuracy. to achieve the highest possible sensitivity both samples were enriched for small rnas with a cut-off range from  <dig> to  <dig> nt. to further increase the sequencing depth  we used one capillary per sample with a capacity of approximately  <dig> million base pairs. our ultra-deep sequencing analysis resulted in the generation of  <dig>  x  <dig> and  <dig>  x  <dig> sequence reads from scn2a and n2a-mock cells, respectively.

for the generation of mirna profiles from these libraries, successive filtering and normalization steps were implemented . as a first step, compression of data was achieved by merging of identical sequence reads and encoding their frequency into the respective sequence identifier. since the population of small rnas must be expected to include mrna degradation products with limited significance
 <cit>  we increased the specificity of our dataset by exclusion of rare sequences. we arbitrarily applied a cut-off for reads with a frequency < <dig>  it should be noted that this stringent cut-off results in loss of information, but is required to reduce the expected false positive rate. identification of all expressed murine mirnas in our samples was achieved by annotation of the filtered dataset to the mirbase  <dig> . our blast analysis allowed up to three mismatches at the 5’- or 3’-end of each mirna, respectively. although this leads to loss of specificity regarding closely related mirnas, it enabled the identification of mirna-processing variants that differ from the mirbase entries
 <cit> . 

to date, several mirnas have been removed from mirbase due to the fact that the sequences were identical to ribosomal rnas , e.g. mir- <dig> and hsa-mir- <dig> from mirbase release  <dig>  . to ensure that our dataset would not include such rrna-derived sequences, we did an additional blast analysis that compared the entire murine mirbase dataset with mouse 28s, 18s, 5s and  <dig> s rrna ncbi entries. we found that  <dig> mirnas appeared to be rrna fragments and thus were removed from our analysis. most, but not all of these rrna fragments were also described by others
 <cit>  and have meanwhile been deleted from mirbase. however, mmu-mir- <dig> and mmu-mir- <dig> are identical to ribosomal sequences and still valid in the current mirbase release  <dig> 

after this successive filtering we identified  <dig> mirnas expressed in mock-infected and  <dig> expressed in scrapie-infected n2a cells, which collectively correspond to  <dig> individual mirnas .

for the identification of regulated mirnas, the libraries derived from scrapie-infected and mock-infected cells needed to be normalized. the normalization of ultra deep sequencing data has been reported to be a crucial step in interpreting regulation
 <cit> . parameswaran and colleagues have described two alternative methods,  the normalization to total small rnas sequenced for each library or  the normalization against the total number of mirnas in the respective samples. applying both normalization methods to our filtered datasets we obtained similar results . however, normalization against the total number of mirnas bears the risk of creating a bias in case that a high proportion of mirnas is regulated. therefore we chose to normalize against the total number of sequence reads.

next we aimed to identify mirnas that were differentially expressed in scrapie-infected cells as compared to mock-infected controls. regulation of mirnas was considered to be robust if the relative abundance differed at least twofold between both libraries. using this analysis strategy we found  <dig> upregulated and seven downregulated mirnas in addition to a number of mirnas that were solely expressed in scn2a or n2a-mock cells. since we had restricted our analysis to sequences that had been read more than ten times, we filtered the solely expressed mirnas for those that were detected more than  <dig> times to reach the criterion of twofold regulation. six mirnas from n2a-mock cells matched this criterion and were termed “downregulated” without assigning a specific regulation factor. the resulting  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated mirnas with their corresponding sequence reads are listed in table
 <dig> 

it is known that the upregulation of mirnas results in the downregulation of their specific target genes. vice versa, downregulation of mirnas could lead to the upregulation mrna levels, presumably by a de-repression mechanism
 <cit> . accordingly, some or all of the  <dig> downregulated mirnas may be responsible for the upregulation of those mrnas that induce prion-associated disturbance of cholesterol homeostasis.

in the light of these considerations we conducted a mirna target search. we examined the 3’-utrs of the cholesterogenic mouse genes  for putative binding sites for the  <dig> downregulated mirnas. four out of  <dig> mirnas were not predicted to bind any of the nine target genes. however, nine mirnas showed multiple targets in at least one of these mrnas . interestingly, four of those mirnas, namely mmu-mir- <dig>  mmu-mir- <dig>  mmu-mir-503*, and mmu-mir-542-5p are located in a genomic cluster within  <dig> kb on the mouse x-chromosome. 

we next validated the regulation of the mirnas from this cluster  by qrt-pcr. for normalization we used the mmu-mir-106b* as a housekeeping mirna, presuming that it was expressed at constant and robustly high levels. using a commercial kit, mmu-mir- <dig> was not detected by qrt-pcr analysis. to provide comparability among the quantification of the different mirnas we did not modify the recommended protocol of the commercial detection kit in order to achieve detection of mmu-mir- <dig>  in comparison, mmu-mir-503* could be detected, however, we could not confirm regulation. the fact that in ultra-deep sequencing the number of sequence reads and the upregulation factors were both at the borderline may have prevented the robust detection of mir-503*-regulation by qrt-pcr. however, the regulation of the more abundantly expressed mirnas mmu-mir- <dig> and −542-5p was confirmed by qrt-pcr, indicating to a high validity of the ultra-deep sequencing . furthermore the magnitude of downregulation in scrapie-infected versus mock-infected cells of mmu-mir- <dig> and mmu-mir-542-5p was comparable to that estimated by ultra-deep sequencing. in summary, our joint profiling approach lead to the identification of two mirna candidates that correlate with disturbance in cholesterol homeostasis in prion-infected cells.

we have now used ultra-deep sequencing technology to profile all micrornas  that could be associated with this effect in these n2a cells. using stringent filters and normalization strategies we identified a small set of mirnas that were up- or downregulated upon prion infection. using bioinformatic tools we predicted whether the downregulated mirnas could target mrnas that have been previously identified to enhance cholesterol synthesis in these cells. application of this joint profiling approach revealed that nine mirnas potentially target cholesterol-related genes. four of those mirnas are localized in a mirna-dense cluster on the mouse x-chromosome. among these, twofold downregulation of mmu-mir- <dig> and mmu-mir-542-5p was confirmed by qrt-pcr. the same mirnas were predicted as putative regulators of the sterol regulatory element-binding factor  <dig> , the low-density lipoprotein receptor  or the ipp isomerase.


CONCLUSIONS
the results demonstrate that joined profiling by ultra-deep sequencing is highly valuable to identify candidate mirnas involved in prion-induced dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis.

"BACKGROUND
malaria pathogenesis poses a major hindrance to development in many parts of the world with more than  <dig> million people suffering from the disease and at least one million dying from p. falciparum infection each year  <cit> .
disease severity has been associated with the accumulation of infected erythrocytes  in microvasculature of vital organs, such as the brain and placenta  <cit> .
a key protein family involved in ie binding is the antigenic variant p. falciparum erythrocyte membrane  <dig>   <cit> .
each parasite genome contains about  <dig> var genes that encode pfemp <dig> proteins  <cit> , which are expressed in a mutually exclusive fashion at the ie surface  <cit> .
switches in var gene expression allow parasites to evade the host antibody response and sequester at different microvascular sites in the body  <cit> .
therefore, further definition of the var gene family conservation, the factors regulating variant antigen gene diversification, and the expression of particular var genes during disease will provide critical insights into malaria pathogenesis and aid disease interventions.
var genes have a two-exon structure  <cit> .
the first exon is large  and encodes multiple adhesion domains called the duffy binding-like  and cysteine-rich interdomain region .
the second exon is smaller  and codes for a more conserved cytoplasmic tail.
although pfemp <dig> sequences are highly diverse, the adhesion domains can be grouped by sequence similarity  <cit>  into seven types of dbl domains  and four types of cidr domains  that have been used as criteria for dissecting pfemp <dig> protein domain structures and binding functions.
the pfemp <dig> proteins in the 3d <dig> genome have been arbitrarily classified into one of seventeen different protein architectural types based upon domain composition  <cit>  and divided into three major  and two intermediate  groups on the basis of 5' upstream  sequence and chromosomal location  <cit> .
var group a genes have upsa flanking sequences and are located in sub-telomeric regions transcribed toward the telomere, while group b consists of telomeric var genes flanked by upsb sequences that are transcribed toward the centromere, and group c are flanked by upsc sequences and are located in central chromosomal regions.
group b/a genes are very similar in location and transcriptional orientation to group b genes, but are located further from the telomere following other var genes or pseudogenes.
in contrast, group b/c genes have an upsb-like 5' flanking sequence, but are located in central chromosomal regions.
thus, it has been postulated that groups b/a and b/c represent transitional groups between the major groupings  <cit> .
inter-isolate comparisons have also revealed the existence of three unusual genes: var1csa, var2csa, and type  <dig> var genes, which appear in nearly all parasite isolates  <cit> .
these semi-conserved homologs may have important roles in the host-parasite interaction.
the pfemp <dig> encoded by var2csa binds the placental adhesion receptor, chondroitin sulfate a , and therefore has a critical role in the pathogenesis of pregnancy associated malaria  <cit> , while no function has yet been ascribed to the proteins encoded by var1csa and type  <dig> var.
the genomic organization of var genes may have an important role in var gene evolution.
similar to other variant antigen families, gene recombination or gene conversion between var paralogs may contribute to the rapid evolution of the gene family  <cit> .
it has been hypothesized that the frequency of recombination between var genes may depend upon chromosomal location, gene orientation, and homology in the gene flanking sequence.
sequence and binding analysis of 3d <dig> var genes indicate that groups b and c pfemp <dig> proteins bind the primary microvasculature receptor  while group a pfemp <dig> proteins do not  <cit> .
thus, var gene recombination hierarchies may promote the evolution of pfemp <dig> adhesion groups with different patterns of sequestration and disease.
a fundamental question is whether the gene organization observed in 3d <dig> occurs in other parasite isolates and contributes to a general recombination mechanism shaping the variant antigen repertoire.
to investigate evolutionary mechanisms of the var gene family and provide new tools to study the role of pfemp <dig> proteins in mediating cytoadhesion, we have sequenced var genes from isolate it4/25/ <dig> , which has maintained the ability to cytoadhere after in vitro adaptation  <cit> , and compared these genes to the var repertories of the 3d <dig> genome reference isolate and of the hb <dig> isolate, for which sequence contigs were recently made available .
although there are currently relatively few reports, isolate hb <dig> also maintains cytoadherence in culture  <cit>  and is therefore a useful addition to comparative var analyses.
all three parasites, it <dig>  hb <dig>  and 3d <dig>  have been cloned in vitro and represent single parasite genotypes.
the it <dig> parasite was originally isolated from brazil  <cit> , but is known to have undergone accidental cross-contamination at an early stage of its history after in vitro adaptation  <cit> .
the hb <dig> clone was derived from the honduras i/cdc isolate  <cit>  and the nf <dig> parent to the 3d <dig> clone was isolated from an individual who lived near an airport in amsterdam and never left the netherlands  <cit> .
based upon genotyping and parasite population studies, it <dig> groups with asian isolates, 3d <dig> groups with african isolates, and hb <dig> represents central america  <cit> .
despite progress in understanding the mechanisms of cytoadhesion and antigenic variation of pfemp <dig>  limited information about the factors regulating variant antigen diversification and the extent of repertoire overlap between parasite isolates exists.
most studies have relied on small var sequence ""tags"" amplified from the first dbl domain in pfemp <dig> proteins  <cit> .
the studies presented here represent the first comprehensive analyses of var genes across multiple parasite isolates.
these comparisons reveal general principles of var gene organization that have become established across geographically diverse parasite isolates and provide powerful tools to study the cytoadherent and immunogenic properties of pfemp <dig> proteins.
RESULTS
the var gene repertoires from the it <dig> and hb <dig> isolates
conservation in the var gene 5' and 3' gene-flanking regions, the semi-conserved exon  <dig>  and other domains allowed us to design a series of primers  and extend it <dig> var tags that we had previously sequenced from the pfemp <dig> dblα, β, γ, and δ domains  <cit> .
we sequenced  <dig> full-length var genes and  <dig> partial genes from the it <dig> isolate , in addition to the  <dig> full-length var genes that have been previously characterized .
these genes represent all but  <dig> of the  <dig> it <dig> sequence tags identified from other studies  <cit> .
in order to estimate the proportion of it <dig> var genes represented by these sequences, we searched the 1× coverage it <dig> genome sequence at the wellcome trust sanger institute  <cit>  for additional var sequences.
out of  <dig> reads with sequence similarity to the first exon of any known var genes, only ~15% do not overlap with our data set.
assembly of these reads shows that most of the non-overlapping reads represent small sequence fragments no larger than a single read and three partial gene fragments of 3– <dig> kb .
thus, the var gene repertoire presented here includes partial or complete sequence for most it <dig> var genes.
eight var genes were mapped to specific chromosomes using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and southern analysis  and in some cases, intrachromosomal location  was identified based on apai restriction fragment length  <cit> .
the chromosomal locations of a further  <dig> var genes were based on previously published data  <cit> .
analysis of the hb <dig> sequence contigs obtained from the 10× coverage genome sequence at the broad institute <cit>  identified  <dig> var genes that contain a dblα domain as well as two var2csa homologs;  <dig> of the  <dig> var genes are full-length,  <dig> are incomplete and six are pseudogenes containing stops or frame-shifts .
examination of 5' and 3' flanking sequences  enabled us to predict the chromosomal location of most genes , although in a number of cases they could not be assigned to specific chromosome ends.
these predictions assume that recombination has not changed the arrangement of chromosome ends in hb <dig> and 3d <dig>
comparisons of the it <dig> and hb <dig> pfemp <dig> protein domain architecture revealed representatives of most classes previously described in 3d <dig>   <cit>  plus fourteen new types .
of the  <dig> domain architectures, most types contain only a single representative per isolate and only seven  are found in all three isolates.
while five  are found only in 3d <dig>  eight  are unique to it <dig>  and six  to hb <dig> .
moreover, the distribution of var genes among the shared domain architecture classes differs substantially between isolates.
more than half  of the 3d <dig> var genes have a type  <dig> architecture, but this type of var gene is rarer in it <dig>  and hb <dig> .
conversely, it <dig> contains six type  <dig> var genes compared to only one in 3d <dig> and hb3; while hb <dig> contains six representatives of type  <dig>  which is not present in either 3d <dig> or it <dig>  the differential abundance of individual pfemp <dig> types between parasite isolates and the presence of new pfemp <dig> types in isolates it <dig> and hb <dig> indicate considerable inter-strain plasticity in the variant antigen repertoire.
despite these differences in gene repertoires, the previously described tandem domain associations  <cit>  are consistently preserved, indicating the potential structural and functional significance of these domain relationships.
abolded protein architectures were detected in all three isolates.
bthese genes were members of the b-st var group.
cthe it <dig> and hb <dig> are partial gene repertoire estimates.
while seven protein architectural types are shared among the three isolates, most var genes have overall amino acid sequence identities of < 50% in individual domains , even those within the same architectural type.
however, three var genes  are highly conserved at the sequence level, with > 75% identity over multiple domains.
partial gene sequence tags for these three var genes have been amplified from many parasite isolates indicating their unusual conservation for the var gene family  <cit> .
however, these isolate-transcendent members can have different copy numbers between parasite isolates.
for instance, while 3d <dig> has three copies of the type  <dig> var, we could amplify only one copy in it <dig> and did not find any copies in the genomic sequence from hb <dig>  in addition, hb <dig> contains two var2csa copies rather than one copy as in 3d <dig> and it <dig>  although var1csa is present in all three parasites, it is a truncated pseudogene in 3d <dig>  and the second exon has a frameshift in the hb <dig> allele.
also, var1csa is believed to be truncated in many field isolates  <cit>  and has a distinct gene transcription pattern from other var genes  <cit> .
therefore it may have a different biological role than other var genes.
sequence comparison of  <dig> – <dig>  kb of 5' flanking sequence from the 3d <dig> var genes has defined five upstream types; upsa, b, c, d, and e types  <cit> .
phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> bp of 5' flanking sequences from the it <dig>  hb <dig>  and 3d <dig> var genes revealed that it <dig> and hb <dig> have similar sequence groupings as 3d <dig> .
while we found similar classes as in previous studies, we have sub-divided upsb into four sub-groups  and upsc into two sub-groups .
this study also revealed that upsd is very similar to upsa , and that these categories can be more accurately referred to as upsa <dig>  and upsa <dig> .
notably, the proportion of var genes in each ups type is similar between isolates .
the 3d <dig> var gene repertoire has been previously categorized into three major  and two intermediate  groups on the basis of ups sequence and chromosomal location  <cit> .
the hb <dig> and it <dig> var genes can be similarly assigned to the three major groups on the basis of ups sequence , but differences in chromosomal location between isolates argue for a modification of the sub-groupings.
for example, the hb <dig> repertoire contains one upsa1-associated var gene  that is in a central chromosomal cluster rather than the typical sub-telomeric location .
therefore, to allow for the future addition of 'atypical' genes, we have developed a naming system based upon var gene location and ups sequence type.
the ups types  when known are listed first followed by a chromosome location reference.
t, st, and sst refer to the first, second, and third var genes from the telomere respectively and c refers to central var genes.
for example, we have now separated var group a into sub-groups a1c, a1st, and a1sst to represent central and sub-telomeric var genes, respectively.
similarly, group b is divided to represent var genes with corresponding central  or telomeric  locations.
members of the b/a group previously defined by lavstsen et al.
<cit>  are now classified as b1st, b2st, etc.
denoting both the 5' upstream type plus a distinct sub-telomeric chromosomal location which follows other var genes or pseudogenes  <cit> .
as observed previously  <cit> , the var gene chromosomal location was highly predictive of 5' gene flanking sequence .
for instance, nearly all centromere-transcribed var genes in the telomeric location were upsb <dig> type .
in contrast, members of the ""transitional"" b/c var group located in central chromosomal locations, associate with any of the 5' flanking sequences upsb1- <dig>  interestingly, while hb <dig> contains a copy of the semi-conserved var1csa gene  with the expected upsa <dig> sequence , the hb <dig> isolate is unique in having a second distinct pfemp <dig> protein associated with the upsa <dig> sequence .
thus, we have classified both within group a2st.
the highly conserved, and sequence divergent, var2csa remains in a separate ups group .
although the general chromosomal distribution of var genes in sub-telomeric regions or central regions on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are similar between the three isolates, the genes themselves are not conserved with the exception of var1csa, var2csa and type  <dig> var.
significantly,var genes in the same chromosomal location from the three isolates differ in both sequence and protein architecture .
furthermore, the order of var ups types in central var gene clusters differ between isolates .
these differences between isolates are evidence of gene recombination that has occurred within the coding and gene-flanking regions.
var gene recombination
to study the genetic relationship of different var genes, we performed repertoire-wide nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons using a number of different approaches and visualization tools .
the artemis comparison tool   <cit>  was used to visualize regions of similarity identified by reciprocal blastn searches of var exon <dig> nucleotide sequences.
using criteria of a word size of 90nt, > 90% identity we observed the gene duplication in 3d <dig>  and identified one gene duplication in hb <dig> .
these gene pairs are nearly identical over their entire lengths .
these analyses also visualize the semi-conserved var genes  identified above, which have multiple regions of high sequence similarity  between isolates .
act comparisons also identified several instances of partial sequence similarity  between two var genes of the same isolate.
selected examples are shown , illustrating the segmental nature of sequence similarity between genes, with only part of each sequence showing a high degree of sequence similarity to the other partner.
the 3d <dig> repertoire contains four examples of such ""chimeric"" gene pairs, the current set of it <dig> var genes has eight, and the hb <dig> repertoire has six .
in some cases , a var gene appears to be a ""true"" chimera of two different var genes , while in other cases the chimeras represent partial duplications between two var genes.
amal8p <dig>  and pfd1235w are duplicated in 3d <dig>  so the match with hb3var <dig> effectively occurs only once.
bthese two genes have a unique upsb <dig> type 5' flanking sequence and are the first genes in a chromosome  <dig> central cluster in hb <dig> and 3d <dig>  respectively.
chighlighted rows indicate multiple hits of high sequence similarity, shared between the same gene pairs.
despite geographic separation of 3d <dig>  it <dig>  and 3d <dig>  similar examples of segmental sequence similarity greater than  <dig> bp can be seen between var genes of the different isolates; with five examples between 3d <dig> and hb <dig>  three between hb <dig> and it <dig> and one between 3d <dig> and it <dig> .
remarkably, one of the inter-isolate gene pairs, hb3var <dig> and pfl1950w, are both the first var genes in a central cluster on chromosome  <dig> .
these two genes have nearly identical and highly distinctive upsb <dig> type 5' flanking sequences  and share approximately  <dig> bp of coding region identity , but otherwise have diverged from one another.
this region of similarity identifies a recombination event that likely predates the continental separation of p. falciparum isolates.
these analyses also demonstrate that most var genes share little sequence identity suggesting that the var genes have diverged extensively between parasite isolates and have undergone segmental recombination .
however, the patterns of sequence identities are not random in that similarities preferentially occur between members of the same ups group .
for instance, upsa <dig> var genes are  <dig> × more likely to share similarity with other upsa <dig> genes than with different ups groups and upsb2- <dig> var genes are  <dig> × more likely to share similarity within the upsb2- <dig> group .
the same trend holds for gene similarities involving smaller gene segments  <dig> nucleotides and up .
an exception is central var genes, which contain ""mixed"" chimeras of upsb and upsc-associated var genes , suggesting both groups of central chromosome var genes are recombining.
to detect patterns of protein similarities, we conducted ""repertoire-wide"" dot-plot analyses using concatamers of var exon <dig> sequences ordered by isolate and 5' flanking sequence type.
these analyses are designed to detect small windows of sequence similarity  between pfemp <dig> amino acid sequences and clearly show that upsa pfemp <dig> proteins share less similarity with upsb and upsc proteins than with other upsa proteins .
conversely, upsb and upsc proteins are indistinguishable in terms of their degree of sequence identity with each other.
this analysis combined with the analyses of individual domains  shows approximately as much overall repertoire similarity within as between these geographically diverse strains.
to identify the regions of similarity between pfemp <dig> proteins, the dotplot matches were plotted along the length of individual proteins.
overall, the dbl <dig> domains in pfemp <dig> proteins tend to have the most similarity between proteins, although there are regions of similarity in some cidr domains .
most of the similarity between pfemp <dig> proteins, including between the b and c groups, is associated with semi-conserved homology blocks in dbl domains .
these homology blocks correspond to structural elements in solved structures  <cit> .
these analyses also clearly illustrate that var2csa and type  <dig> proteins share almost no identity with other pfemp <dig> proteins.
curiously, the rosetting-associated it4var <dig> protein is not related to other upsa proteins over most of its length .
however, unlike the semi-conserved type  <dig> var or var2csa, hb <dig> and 3d <dig> do not have a var <dig> homolog.
although this result suggests that it4var <dig> is not recombining with other var genes, more study is needed to determine its conservation in the parasite population.
taken together, these sequence comparisons support the hypothesis that var genes have differentiated into separately recombining groups that may be important to the evolution of the structure and function of pfemp <dig> proteins.
discussion
while the sequencing of the 3d <dig> genome has contributed greatly in determining pfemp <dig> functions and genetic diversity , the associations of var gene repertoires within and between parasite isolates and the factors regulating variant antigen diversification remain largely unknown.
to gain understanding into the evolutionary mechanisms shaping the variant antigen repertoire we present here the nearly complete var repertoire of a cytoadhesive laboratory isolate, it4/25/ <dig>  and compare it to the 3d <dig> genome reference isolate and the recently sequenced hb <dig> genome.
despite the enormous diversity of these genes, several features of the var gene family are conserved across isolates including var groupings based upon central or telomeric chromosome location and 5' flanking sequence that may have an important role in the evolution and function of var genes.
it has been hypothesized that an original ancestral var gene was duplicated and diverged into the three main var groups  and subsequently into additional transitional groups  <cit> .
this interpretation is supported by our analyses showing similar categories of var genes in all three parasite isolates.
based upon sequence comparisons, b and c groups are more similar, even though these genes tend to occupy different chromosomal locations at sub-telomeric and central chromosomal regions, respectively.
however, the regions of similarity are predominantly associated with semiconserved homology blocks that are predicted to form the structural scaffolding for the dbl adhesion domains.
conversely, the group a genes differ greatly from the b and c groups while the coding region of the three isolate transcendent var genes, var1csa, var2csa, and type  <dig> var genes have unique features and are different from all other var genes.
however, these isolate transcendent var genes are more related to the upsa group in that they are sub-telomeric, transcribed towards the telomere, and have 5' gene flanking regions that most resemble the upsa type.
repertoire-wide sequence comparisons show that most gene similarities occur between genes within the same var group, particularly for gene segments larger than  <dig> bp.
an exception is central var clusters, which contain both upsb and upsc-associated var genes.
while the functional significance of these different 5' promoter types is not completely understood  <cit> , these two sets of central var genes appear to be recombining with each other.
taken together, these analyses suggest that var gene recombination preferentially occurs within var groups, with the exception of the semi-conserved var homologs that appear to recombine on their own.
further var gene comparisons of parasites undergoing more frequent recombination in nature or parasite crosses will be of interest to determine the relative frequency of intra- versus inter-group gene recombination.
these findings provide insight into the mechanisms that generate antigenic diversity in p. falciparum through gene recombination hierarchies, and may have parallels in other variant antigen gene families in plasmodium and other organisms.
the mechanisms of gene recombination/conversion are not well studied in p. falciparum.
sequence comparisons and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of parasite crosses and population studies suggest that both small  and larger recombination events contribute to var gene evolution  <cit> .
here, we observe that chimeric junction sites are often not ""clean"" breakpoints and have smaller sections of 90–95% identity  <dig> bp upstream and/or downstream of the central homologous region .
this feature may relate to a mechanism of recombination.
control of var gene expression has been connected to silence-inducing regulators of gene expression  and chromatin packaging  <cit> .
recent studies have shown a possible link between factors involved in transcription regulation  and recombination .
it is interesting to speculate that in p. falciparum, factors that are silencing/controlling var gene expression may also be involved in the recombination and gene conversion mechanisms.
from a study of 3d <dig> var genes expressed after antibody selection, it has been hypothesized that group a may contain common antigenic types that are responsible for severe disease  <cit> .
although the duplicated 3d <dig> upsa var genes, pfd1235w and mal8p <dig> , have been proposed as a fourth isolate-transcendent variant, termed var <dig>  our analyses do not support this conclusion since a var <dig> homolog was not found in it <dig> or hb <dig>  although the hb <dig> isolate contained a match over a portion of the gene.
in addition, var4-like gene fragments were not common in a global survey of parasite isolates using gene-specific primers  <cit> .
instead, this observation may represent one of a number of between-genome var chimeras which are not present in all parasite genomes.
more study is required to determine which segments of var <dig> are maintained in the parasite population and the extent to which the same segments are shared by different parasite isolates.
more generally, with the exception of the type  <dig> var genes and var1csa, the upsa-associated var genes are not highly conserved between the three isolates.
this observation reinforces findings of high genetic diversity of upsa-associated dblα tags from a global collection of parasite isolates  <cit> .
various factors may influence the stability of large var gene segments across a parasite population, including malaria endemicity, the frequency of mixed infections, or functional selection on that gene segment for binding.
the diversity of the upsa var genes suggests that antibody cross-reactivity between different parasite isolates does not necessarily imply the presence of isolate-transcendent var genes, but may be due to cross-reacting antibody epitopes on different pfemp <dig> sequences.
although the possibility that a subset of var genes may be associated with severe malaria remains, these genes may not be as conserved across parasite isolates as the pregnancy malaria vaccine candidate var2csa.
the concept of a recombination hierarchy has implications for the evolution of parasite virulence and disease investigation.
the conservation of var groupings across isolates raises the possibility that var groups may be diverging and/or evolving in characteristic patterns.
for instance, group a var genes, with the exception of the type  <dig> var genes, encode larger proteins with more complex domain compositions and have different protein head structures  from other var groups .
in contrast, the relatively small type  <dig> proteins, which consist of four adhesion domains, are not associated with group a in any of the isolates.
it has been suggested that immune selection can cause polymorphic antigens to self-organize into sets of non-overlapping variants within a population  <cit> .
increased frequency of inter-locus recombination or gene conversion may also act as a homogenizing force leading to the functional and structural specialization of different gene groups  <cit> .
interestingly, the proportion of small to larger pfemp <dig> proteins and the distribution of pfemp <dig> architectural types differed between isolates.
given the different selective pressures for binding and immune evasion, it may be to the parasite's advantage to have different sets of recombining genes  <cit> .
these sets might include genes optimized to promote rapid parasite growth and transmission in the non-immune host, diversified genes that promote parasite transmission and persistence of infection in the face of higher levels of host immunity or organ-specific variants that expand parasite tropism to new host tissues, such as the placenta.
unlike many isolates that have been adapted to in vitro cultivation, the it <dig> genotype stably maintains the cytoadherent phenotype and therefore has become the primary model for this virulence determinant.
cd <dig> binding, intercellular adhesion molecule  <dig>  binding, and infected erythrocyte rosetting, or the binding of infected erythrocytes to uninfected erythrocytes, have been shown to reside in multiple different it <dig> pfemp <dig> proteins .
although proteins that bind the same host receptor frequently use the same type of binding domain  <cit> , the overall protein architectures are highly distinct.
for instance, three icam- <dig> binding pfemp <dig> proteins  all use dblβ c <dig> domains but have different domain structure types and two rosetting pfemp <dig> proteins, r29var  <cit>  and fcrs <dig> var <dig>  <cit>  also have different domain structure types and bind different receptors on the erythrocyte surface.
our study completes the sequences for three additional it <dig> var genes upregulated in rosetting parasite clones, which were previously identified by only their dblα tag sequences   <cit> .
overall, the rosetting var protein structures are not highly related , although the dbl1α <dig> domain is similar between the upsa-linked r29var and it4var <dig> predicted proteins, which may be significant because dbl1α <dig> is an erythrocyte binding region in r29var  <cit> .
in contrast, the other three rosetting-linked var genes  have dblα domains instead of dblα <dig> domains and associate with ups b, c, or unknown ups sequence.
while these comparisons suggest that rosetting pfemp <dig> proteins are not restricted to particular var groups, further study is needed to determine whether rosetting proteins in the same var group use a similar constellation of erythrocyte receptors.
CONCLUSIONS
a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for malaria pathogenesis is lacking, partly because of the complexity of the var gene family and the inability to model cytoadhesion with most culture-adapted laboratory isolates.
in this study, we determined the var gene repertoires from the it <dig> and hb <dig> isolates and provide evidence for a recombination hierarchy that shapes the evolution of the pfemp <dig> virulence determinant.
furthermore, determination of the nearly complete var gene repertoire from the cytoadhesive it <dig> parasite genotype, which has been adapted to both grow in the laboratory and infect new world monkeys, provides a unique capability to model cytoadhesion and immune acquisition in vitro and in vivo.
future binding and expression studies with cytoadhesive laboratory isolates, such as it <dig> and hb <dig>  in conjunction with analyses of the fully sequenced genomes will allow us to classify pfemp <dig> proteins into biologically meaningful subsets and greatly accelerate understanding into malaria pathogenesis and immune evasion.
",584,"BACKGROUND
malaria pathogenesis poses a major hindrance to development in many parts of the world with more than  <dig> million people suffering from the disease and at least one million dying from p. falciparum infection each year  <cit> . disease severity has been associated with the accumulation of infected erythrocytes  in microvasculature of vital organs, such as the brain and placenta  <cit> . a key protein family involved in ie binding is the antigenic variant p. falciparum erythrocyte membrane  <dig>   <cit> . each parasite genome contains about  <dig> var genes that encode pfemp <dig> proteins  <cit> , which are expressed in a mutually exclusive fashion at the ie surface  <cit> . switches in var gene expression allow parasites to evade the host antibody response and sequester at different microvascular sites in the body  <cit> . therefore, further definition of the var gene family conservation, the factors regulating variant antigen gene diversification, and the expression of particular var genes during disease will provide critical insights into malaria pathogenesis and aid disease interventions.

var genes have a two-exon structure  <cit> . the first exon is large  and encodes multiple adhesion domains called the duffy binding-like  and cysteine-rich interdomain region . the second exon is smaller  and codes for a more conserved cytoplasmic tail. although pfemp <dig> sequences are highly diverse, the adhesion domains can be grouped by sequence similarity  <cit>  into seven types of dbl domains  and four types of cidr domains  that have been used as criteria for dissecting pfemp <dig> protein domain structures and binding functions.

the pfemp <dig> proteins in the 3d <dig> genome have been arbitrarily classified into one of seventeen different protein architectural types based upon domain composition  <cit>  and divided into three major  and two intermediate  groups on the basis of 5' upstream  sequence and chromosomal location  <cit> . var group a genes have upsa flanking sequences and are located in sub-telomeric regions transcribed toward the telomere, while group b consists of telomeric var genes flanked by upsb sequences that are transcribed toward the centromere, and group c are flanked by upsc sequences and are located in central chromosomal regions. group b/a genes are very similar in location and transcriptional orientation to group b genes, but are located further from the telomere following other var genes or pseudogenes. in contrast, group b/c genes have an upsb-like 5' flanking sequence, but are located in central chromosomal regions. thus, it has been postulated that groups b/a and b/c represent transitional groups between the major groupings  <cit> .

inter-isolate comparisons have also revealed the existence of three unusual genes: var1csa, var2csa, and type  <dig> var genes, which appear in nearly all parasite isolates  <cit> . these semi-conserved homologs may have important roles in the host-parasite interaction. the pfemp <dig> encoded by var2csa binds the placental adhesion receptor, chondroitin sulfate a , and therefore has a critical role in the pathogenesis of pregnancy associated malaria  <cit> , while no function has yet been ascribed to the proteins encoded by var1csa and type  <dig> var.

the genomic organization of var genes may have an important role in var gene evolution. similar to other variant antigen families, gene recombination or gene conversion between var paralogs may contribute to the rapid evolution of the gene family  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that the frequency of recombination between var genes may depend upon chromosomal location, gene orientation, and homology in the gene flanking sequence. sequence and binding analysis of 3d <dig> var genes indicate that groups b and c pfemp <dig> proteins bind the primary microvasculature receptor  while group a pfemp <dig> proteins do not  <cit> . thus, var gene recombination hierarchies may promote the evolution of pfemp <dig> adhesion groups with different patterns of sequestration and disease. a fundamental question is whether the gene organization observed in 3d <dig> occurs in other parasite isolates and contributes to a general recombination mechanism shaping the variant antigen repertoire.

to investigate evolutionary mechanisms of the var gene family and provide new tools to study the role of pfemp <dig> proteins in mediating cytoadhesion, we have sequenced var genes from isolate it4/25/ <dig> , which has maintained the ability to cytoadhere after in vitro adaptation  <cit> , and compared these genes to the var repertories of the 3d <dig> genome reference isolate and of the hb <dig> isolate, for which sequence contigs were recently made available . although there are currently relatively few reports, isolate hb <dig> also maintains cytoadherence in culture  <cit>  and is therefore a useful addition to comparative var analyses.

all three parasites, it <dig>  hb <dig>  and 3d <dig>  have been cloned in vitro and represent single parasite genotypes. the it <dig> parasite was originally isolated from brazil  <cit> , but is known to have undergone accidental cross-contamination at an early stage of its history after in vitro adaptation  <cit> . the hb <dig> clone was derived from the honduras i/cdc isolate  <cit>  and the nf <dig> parent to the 3d <dig> clone was isolated from an individual who lived near an airport in amsterdam and never left the netherlands  <cit> . based upon genotyping and parasite population studies, it <dig> groups with asian isolates, 3d <dig> groups with african isolates, and hb <dig> represents central america  <cit> .

despite progress in understanding the mechanisms of cytoadhesion and antigenic variation of pfemp <dig>  limited information about the factors regulating variant antigen diversification and the extent of repertoire overlap between parasite isolates exists. most studies have relied on small var sequence ""tags"" amplified from the first dbl domain in pfemp <dig> proteins  <cit> . the studies presented here represent the first comprehensive analyses of var genes across multiple parasite isolates. these comparisons reveal general principles of var gene organization that have become established across geographically diverse parasite isolates and provide powerful tools to study the cytoadherent and immunogenic properties of pfemp <dig> proteins.

RESULTS
the var gene repertoires from the it <dig> and hb <dig> isolates
conservation in the var gene 5' and 3' gene-flanking regions, the semi-conserved exon  <dig>  and other domains allowed us to design a series of primers  and extend it <dig> var tags that we had previously sequenced from the pfemp <dig> dblα, β, γ, and δ domains  <cit> . we sequenced  <dig> full-length var genes and  <dig> partial genes from the it <dig> isolate , in addition to the  <dig> full-length var genes that have been previously characterized . these genes represent all but  <dig> of the  <dig> it <dig> sequence tags identified from other studies  <cit> . in order to estimate the proportion of it <dig> var genes represented by these sequences, we searched the 1× coverage it <dig> genome sequence at the wellcome trust sanger institute  <cit>  for additional var sequences. out of  <dig> reads with sequence similarity to the first exon of any known var genes, only ~15% do not overlap with our data set. assembly of these reads shows that most of the non-overlapping reads represent small sequence fragments no larger than a single read and three partial gene fragments of 3– <dig> kb . thus, the var gene repertoire presented here includes partial or complete sequence for most it <dig> var genes. eight var genes were mapped to specific chromosomes using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and southern analysis  and in some cases, intrachromosomal location  was identified based on apai restriction fragment length  <cit> . the chromosomal locations of a further  <dig> var genes were based on previously published data  <cit> .

analysis of the hb <dig> sequence contigs obtained from the 10× coverage genome sequence at the broad institute <cit>  identified  <dig> var genes that contain a dblα domain as well as two var2csa homologs;  <dig> of the  <dig> var genes are full-length,  <dig> are incomplete and six are pseudogenes containing stops or frame-shifts . examination of 5' and 3' flanking sequences  enabled us to predict the chromosomal location of most genes , although in a number of cases they could not be assigned to specific chromosome ends. these predictions assume that recombination has not changed the arrangement of chromosome ends in hb <dig> and 3d <dig> 

comparisons of the it <dig> and hb <dig> pfemp <dig> protein domain architecture revealed representatives of most classes previously described in 3d <dig>   <cit>  plus fourteen new types . of the  <dig> domain architectures, most types contain only a single representative per isolate and only seven  are found in all three isolates. while five  are found only in 3d <dig>  eight  are unique to it <dig>  and six  to hb <dig> . moreover, the distribution of var genes among the shared domain architecture classes differs substantially between isolates. more than half  of the 3d <dig> var genes have a type  <dig> architecture, but this type of var gene is rarer in it <dig>  and hb <dig> . conversely, it <dig> contains six type  <dig> var genes compared to only one in 3d <dig> and hb3; while hb <dig> contains six representatives of type  <dig>  which is not present in either 3d <dig> or it <dig>  the differential abundance of individual pfemp <dig> types between parasite isolates and the presence of new pfemp <dig> types in isolates it <dig> and hb <dig> indicate considerable inter-strain plasticity in the variant antigen repertoire. despite these differences in gene repertoires, the previously described tandem domain associations  <cit>  are consistently preserved, indicating the potential structural and functional significance of these domain relationships.

abolded protein architectures were detected in all three isolates.

bthese genes were members of the b-st var group.

cthe it <dig> and hb <dig> are partial gene repertoire estimates.

while seven protein architectural types are shared among the three isolates, most var genes have overall amino acid sequence identities of < 50% in individual domains , even those within the same architectural type. however, three var genes  are highly conserved at the sequence level, with > 75% identity over multiple domains. partial gene sequence tags for these three var genes have been amplified from many parasite isolates indicating their unusual conservation for the var gene family  <cit> . however, these isolate-transcendent members can have different copy numbers between parasite isolates. for instance, while 3d <dig> has three copies of the type  <dig> var, we could amplify only one copy in it <dig> and did not find any copies in the genomic sequence from hb <dig>  in addition, hb <dig> contains two var2csa copies rather than one copy as in 3d <dig> and it <dig>  although var1csa is present in all three parasites, it is a truncated pseudogene in 3d <dig>  and the second exon has a frameshift in the hb <dig> allele. also, var1csa is believed to be truncated in many field isolates  <cit>  and has a distinct gene transcription pattern from other var genes  <cit> . therefore it may have a different biological role than other var genes.

sequence comparison of  <dig> – <dig>  kb of 5' flanking sequence from the 3d <dig> var genes has defined five upstream types; upsa, b, c, d, and e types  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> bp of 5' flanking sequences from the it <dig>  hb <dig>  and 3d <dig> var genes revealed that it <dig> and hb <dig> have similar sequence groupings as 3d <dig> . while we found similar classes as in previous studies, we have sub-divided upsb into four sub-groups  and upsc into two sub-groups . this study also revealed that upsd is very similar to upsa , and that these categories can be more accurately referred to as upsa <dig>  and upsa <dig> . notably, the proportion of var genes in each ups type is similar between isolates .

the 3d <dig> var gene repertoire has been previously categorized into three major  and two intermediate  groups on the basis of ups sequence and chromosomal location  <cit> . the hb <dig> and it <dig> var genes can be similarly assigned to the three major groups on the basis of ups sequence , but differences in chromosomal location between isolates argue for a modification of the sub-groupings. for example, the hb <dig> repertoire contains one upsa1-associated var gene  that is in a central chromosomal cluster rather than the typical sub-telomeric location . therefore, to allow for the future addition of 'atypical' genes, we have developed a naming system based upon var gene location and ups sequence type. the ups types  when known are listed first followed by a chromosome location reference. t, st, and sst refer to the first, second, and third var genes from the telomere respectively and c refers to central var genes. for example, we have now separated var group a into sub-groups a1c, a1st, and a1sst to represent central and sub-telomeric var genes, respectively. similarly, group b is divided to represent var genes with corresponding central  or telomeric  locations. members of the b/a group previously defined by lavstsen et al.  <cit>  are now classified as b1st, b2st, etc. denoting both the 5' upstream type plus a distinct sub-telomeric chromosomal location which follows other var genes or pseudogenes  <cit> .

as observed previously  <cit> , the var gene chromosomal location was highly predictive of 5' gene flanking sequence . for instance, nearly all centromere-transcribed var genes in the telomeric location were upsb <dig> type . in contrast, members of the ""transitional"" b/c var group located in central chromosomal locations, associate with any of the 5' flanking sequences upsb1- <dig>  interestingly, while hb <dig> contains a copy of the semi-conserved var1csa gene  with the expected upsa <dig> sequence , the hb <dig> isolate is unique in having a second distinct pfemp <dig> protein associated with the upsa <dig> sequence . thus, we have classified both within group a2st. the highly conserved, and sequence divergent, var2csa remains in a separate ups group .

although the general chromosomal distribution of var genes in sub-telomeric regions or central regions on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are similar between the three isolates, the genes themselves are not conserved with the exception of var1csa, var2csa and type  <dig> var. significantly,var genes in the same chromosomal location from the three isolates differ in both sequence and protein architecture . furthermore, the order of var ups types in central var gene clusters differ between isolates . these differences between isolates are evidence of gene recombination that has occurred within the coding and gene-flanking regions.

var gene recombination
to study the genetic relationship of different var genes, we performed repertoire-wide nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons using a number of different approaches and visualization tools . the artemis comparison tool   <cit>  was used to visualize regions of similarity identified by reciprocal blastn searches of var exon <dig> nucleotide sequences. using criteria of a word size of 90nt, > 90% identity we observed the gene duplication in 3d <dig>  and identified one gene duplication in hb <dig> . these gene pairs are nearly identical over their entire lengths . these analyses also visualize the semi-conserved var genes  identified above, which have multiple regions of high sequence similarity  between isolates .

act comparisons also identified several instances of partial sequence similarity  between two var genes of the same isolate. selected examples are shown , illustrating the segmental nature of sequence similarity between genes, with only part of each sequence showing a high degree of sequence similarity to the other partner. the 3d <dig> repertoire contains four examples of such ""chimeric"" gene pairs, the current set of it <dig> var genes has eight, and the hb <dig> repertoire has six . in some cases , a var gene appears to be a ""true"" chimera of two different var genes , while in other cases the chimeras represent partial duplications between two var genes.

amal8p <dig>  and pfd1235w are duplicated in 3d <dig>  so the match with hb3var <dig> effectively occurs only once.

bthese two genes have a unique upsb <dig> type 5' flanking sequence and are the first genes in a chromosome  <dig> central cluster in hb <dig> and 3d <dig>  respectively.

chighlighted rows indicate multiple hits of high sequence similarity, shared between the same gene pairs.

despite geographic separation of 3d <dig>  it <dig>  and 3d <dig>  similar examples of segmental sequence similarity greater than  <dig> bp can be seen between var genes of the different isolates; with five examples between 3d <dig> and hb <dig>  three between hb <dig> and it <dig> and one between 3d <dig> and it <dig> . remarkably, one of the inter-isolate gene pairs, hb3var <dig> and pfl1950w, are both the first var genes in a central cluster on chromosome  <dig> . these two genes have nearly identical and highly distinctive upsb <dig> type 5' flanking sequences  and share approximately  <dig> bp of coding region identity , but otherwise have diverged from one another. this region of similarity identifies a recombination event that likely predates the continental separation of p. falciparum isolates.

these analyses also demonstrate that most var genes share little sequence identity suggesting that the var genes have diverged extensively between parasite isolates and have undergone segmental recombination . however, the patterns of sequence identities are not random in that similarities preferentially occur between members of the same ups group . for instance, upsa <dig> var genes are  <dig> × more likely to share similarity with other upsa <dig> genes than with different ups groups and upsb2- <dig> var genes are  <dig> × more likely to share similarity within the upsb2- <dig> group . the same trend holds for gene similarities involving smaller gene segments  <dig> nucleotides and up . an exception is central var genes, which contain ""mixed"" chimeras of upsb and upsc-associated var genes , suggesting both groups of central chromosome var genes are recombining.

to detect patterns of protein similarities, we conducted ""repertoire-wide"" dot-plot analyses using concatamers of var exon <dig> sequences ordered by isolate and 5' flanking sequence type. these analyses are designed to detect small windows of sequence similarity  between pfemp <dig> amino acid sequences and clearly show that upsa pfemp <dig> proteins share less similarity with upsb and upsc proteins than with other upsa proteins . conversely, upsb and upsc proteins are indistinguishable in terms of their degree of sequence identity with each other. this analysis combined with the analyses of individual domains  shows approximately as much overall repertoire similarity within as between these geographically diverse strains.

to identify the regions of similarity between pfemp <dig> proteins, the dotplot matches were plotted along the length of individual proteins. overall, the dbl <dig> domains in pfemp <dig> proteins tend to have the most similarity between proteins, although there are regions of similarity in some cidr domains . most of the similarity between pfemp <dig> proteins, including between the b and c groups, is associated with semi-conserved homology blocks in dbl domains . these homology blocks correspond to structural elements in solved structures  <cit> . these analyses also clearly illustrate that var2csa and type  <dig> proteins share almost no identity with other pfemp <dig> proteins. curiously, the rosetting-associated it4var <dig> protein is not related to other upsa proteins over most of its length . however, unlike the semi-conserved type  <dig> var or var2csa, hb <dig> and 3d <dig> do not have a var <dig> homolog. although this result suggests that it4var <dig> is not recombining with other var genes, more study is needed to determine its conservation in the parasite population. taken together, these sequence comparisons support the hypothesis that var genes have differentiated into separately recombining groups that may be important to the evolution of the structure and function of pfemp <dig> proteins.

discussion
while the sequencing of the 3d <dig> genome has contributed greatly in determining pfemp <dig> functions and genetic diversity , the associations of var gene repertoires within and between parasite isolates and the factors regulating variant antigen diversification remain largely unknown. to gain understanding into the evolutionary mechanisms shaping the variant antigen repertoire we present here the nearly complete var repertoire of a cytoadhesive laboratory isolate, it4/25/ <dig>  and compare it to the 3d <dig> genome reference isolate and the recently sequenced hb <dig> genome.

despite the enormous diversity of these genes, several features of the var gene family are conserved across isolates including var groupings based upon central or telomeric chromosome location and 5' flanking sequence that may have an important role in the evolution and function of var genes. it has been hypothesized that an original ancestral var gene was duplicated and diverged into the three main var groups  and subsequently into additional transitional groups  <cit> . this interpretation is supported by our analyses showing similar categories of var genes in all three parasite isolates.

based upon sequence comparisons, b and c groups are more similar, even though these genes tend to occupy different chromosomal locations at sub-telomeric and central chromosomal regions, respectively. however, the regions of similarity are predominantly associated with semiconserved homology blocks that are predicted to form the structural scaffolding for the dbl adhesion domains. conversely, the group a genes differ greatly from the b and c groups while the coding region of the three isolate transcendent var genes, var1csa, var2csa, and type  <dig> var genes have unique features and are different from all other var genes. however, these isolate transcendent var genes are more related to the upsa group in that they are sub-telomeric, transcribed towards the telomere, and have 5' gene flanking regions that most resemble the upsa type.

repertoire-wide sequence comparisons show that most gene similarities occur between genes within the same var group, particularly for gene segments larger than  <dig> bp. an exception is central var clusters, which contain both upsb and upsc-associated var genes. while the functional significance of these different 5' promoter types is not completely understood  <cit> , these two sets of central var genes appear to be recombining with each other. taken together, these analyses suggest that var gene recombination preferentially occurs within var groups, with the exception of the semi-conserved var homologs that appear to recombine on their own. further var gene comparisons of parasites undergoing more frequent recombination in nature or parasite crosses will be of interest to determine the relative frequency of intra- versus inter-group gene recombination. these findings provide insight into the mechanisms that generate antigenic diversity in p. falciparum through gene recombination hierarchies, and may have parallels in other variant antigen gene families in plasmodium and other organisms.

the mechanisms of gene recombination/conversion are not well studied in p. falciparum. sequence comparisons and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of parasite crosses and population studies suggest that both small  and larger recombination events contribute to var gene evolution  <cit> . here, we observe that chimeric junction sites are often not ""clean"" breakpoints and have smaller sections of 90–95% identity  <dig> bp upstream and/or downstream of the central homologous region . this feature may relate to a mechanism of recombination. control of var gene expression has been connected to silence-inducing regulators of gene expression  and chromatin packaging  <cit> . recent studies have shown a possible link between factors involved in transcription regulation  and recombination . it is interesting to speculate that in p. falciparum, factors that are silencing/controlling var gene expression may also be involved in the recombination and gene conversion mechanisms.

from a study of 3d <dig> var genes expressed after antibody selection, it has been hypothesized that group a may contain common antigenic types that are responsible for severe disease  <cit> . although the duplicated 3d <dig> upsa var genes, pfd1235w and mal8p <dig> , have been proposed as a fourth isolate-transcendent variant, termed var <dig>  our analyses do not support this conclusion since a var <dig> homolog was not found in it <dig> or hb <dig>  although the hb <dig> isolate contained a match over a portion of the gene. in addition, var4-like gene fragments were not common in a global survey of parasite isolates using gene-specific primers  <cit> . instead, this observation may represent one of a number of between-genome var chimeras which are not present in all parasite genomes. more study is required to determine which segments of var <dig> are maintained in the parasite population and the extent to which the same segments are shared by different parasite isolates.

more generally, with the exception of the type  <dig> var genes and var1csa, the upsa-associated var genes are not highly conserved between the three isolates. this observation reinforces findings of high genetic diversity of upsa-associated dblα tags from a global collection of parasite isolates  <cit> . various factors may influence the stability of large var gene segments across a parasite population, including malaria endemicity, the frequency of mixed infections, or functional selection on that gene segment for binding. the diversity of the upsa var genes suggests that antibody cross-reactivity between different parasite isolates does not necessarily imply the presence of isolate-transcendent var genes, but may be due to cross-reacting antibody epitopes on different pfemp <dig> sequences. although the possibility that a subset of var genes may be associated with severe malaria remains, these genes may not be as conserved across parasite isolates as the pregnancy malaria vaccine candidate var2csa.

the concept of a recombination hierarchy has implications for the evolution of parasite virulence and disease investigation. the conservation of var groupings across isolates raises the possibility that var groups may be diverging and/or evolving in characteristic patterns. for instance, group a var genes, with the exception of the type  <dig> var genes, encode larger proteins with more complex domain compositions and have different protein head structures  from other var groups . in contrast, the relatively small type  <dig> proteins, which consist of four adhesion domains, are not associated with group a in any of the isolates. it has been suggested that immune selection can cause polymorphic antigens to self-organize into sets of non-overlapping variants within a population  <cit> . increased frequency of inter-locus recombination or gene conversion may also act as a homogenizing force leading to the functional and structural specialization of different gene groups  <cit> . interestingly, the proportion of small to larger pfemp <dig> proteins and the distribution of pfemp <dig> architectural types differed between isolates. given the different selective pressures for binding and immune evasion, it may be to the parasite's advantage to have different sets of recombining genes  <cit> . these sets might include genes optimized to promote rapid parasite growth and transmission in the non-immune host, diversified genes that promote parasite transmission and persistence of infection in the face of higher levels of host immunity or organ-specific variants that expand parasite tropism to new host tissues, such as the placenta.

unlike many isolates that have been adapted to in vitro cultivation, the it <dig> genotype stably maintains the cytoadherent phenotype and therefore has become the primary model for this virulence determinant. cd <dig> binding, intercellular adhesion molecule  <dig>  binding, and infected erythrocyte rosetting, or the binding of infected erythrocytes to uninfected erythrocytes, have been shown to reside in multiple different it <dig> pfemp <dig> proteins . although proteins that bind the same host receptor frequently use the same type of binding domain  <cit> , the overall protein architectures are highly distinct. for instance, three icam- <dig> binding pfemp <dig> proteins  all use dblβ c <dig> domains but have different domain structure types and two rosetting pfemp <dig> proteins, r29var  <cit>  and fcrs <dig> var <dig>  <cit>  also have different domain structure types and bind different receptors on the erythrocyte surface. our study completes the sequences for three additional it <dig> var genes upregulated in rosetting parasite clones, which were previously identified by only their dblα tag sequences   <cit> . overall, the rosetting var protein structures are not highly related , although the dbl1α <dig> domain is similar between the upsa-linked r29var and it4var <dig> predicted proteins, which may be significant because dbl1α <dig> is an erythrocyte binding region in r29var  <cit> . in contrast, the other three rosetting-linked var genes  have dblα domains instead of dblα <dig> domains and associate with ups b, c, or unknown ups sequence. while these comparisons suggest that rosetting pfemp <dig> proteins are not restricted to particular var groups, further study is needed to determine whether rosetting proteins in the same var group use a similar constellation of erythrocyte receptors.

CONCLUSIONS
a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for malaria pathogenesis is lacking, partly because of the complexity of the var gene family and the inability to model cytoadhesion with most culture-adapted laboratory isolates. in this study, we determined the var gene repertoires from the it <dig> and hb <dig> isolates and provide evidence for a recombination hierarchy that shapes the evolution of the pfemp <dig> virulence determinant. furthermore, determination of the nearly complete var gene repertoire from the cytoadhesive it <dig> parasite genotype, which has been adapted to both grow in the laboratory and infect new world monkeys, provides a unique capability to model cytoadhesion and immune acquisition in vitro and in vivo. future binding and expression studies with cytoadhesive laboratory isolates, such as it <dig> and hb <dig>  in conjunction with analyses of the fully sequenced genomes will allow us to classify pfemp <dig> proteins into biologically meaningful subsets and greatly accelerate understanding into malaria pathogenesis and immune evasion.

"BACKGROUND
protein interaction data are an increasingly important bioinformatics dataset used in biomedical research.
these data are generated by a multitude of methods including both high-throughput and more traditional low-throughput proteomics studies  <cit>  as well as in silico predictions based on known interactions  <cit> .
the past several years have seen a proliferation of interaction databases as the field focuses on ways to collect these data into machine readable formats where they may be more easily computed on and reliably exchanged between users.
the international molecular exchange   <cit>  represents one effort to consolidate efforts of interaction databases by facilitating exchange of information between primary databases according to an agreed standard exchange language called the human proteome organization's proteomics standards initiative molecular interaction format   <cit> .
archival members of imex agree to share and provide a full dataset of globally available imex molecular interaction records  in a manner similar to the international nucleotide sequence database collaboration   <cit> .
imex also serves to coordinate curation tasks between the partner databases to avoid redundant efforts.
imex is open to new members and is comprised of five active partners including dip  <cit> , intact  <cit> , mint  <cit> , mpact  <cit>  and biogrid  <cit> .
the potential for new imex members is enormous: one recent compilation of protein-protein interaction resources listed over  <dig> databases  <cit> .
this large list represents a lively interest in interaction data; it also represents a problem for the user searching for information since there is no unifying index.
we set out to create such an index with two goals in mind; first the index should be capable of grouping together equivalent protein interactions into a single group.
the measure of equivalence should be based on exact sequence matches of the protein participants according to the source record without further interpretation based on, for example, encoding genes or near sequence identity.
second, operations performed to map protein and interaction records to these redundant groups should be preserved; this would allow for the mapping to be recreated for data integrity checking and would help identify and classify potential problem records.
presently, imex archival databases provide a complete set of records generated by its members; however, these records are meant to be archival and do not resolve redundancies between records.
this becomes problematic when trying to compile a non-redundant list of interactors for a given protein especially when records may use different identifiers to describe the same protein.
a number of recent studies have addressed this issue and reported on databases and/or software that aim to generate consolidated interaction data sets from primary interaction databases .
mimi groups together redundant protein interactors and redundant interactions using ""keyless identity functions"" and ""deep merging""; however, these methods are never explicitly defined  <cit> .
piana software also allows for integration of protein interaction data from multiple sources and apparently resolves redundancies between different protein identifier types; again, the methods used to do this are never explicitly defined  <cit> .
cpath software also allows users to integrate protein interaction data from multiple sources.
redundant proteins are identified using lookup tables that may be defined by the user  <cit> ; however, identical interactions and complexes are not grouped together.
the solution presented in this study is unique in that it uses a well-defined, reproducible method to assign distinct identifiers to each distinct protein and to each distinct interaction and/or complex in which the protein participates.
our method is also unique in that it was designed to trace this process and provide feedback to source databases on problematic assignments.
mapping protein identifiers to redundant groups is at the heart of this task and a number of solutions exist .
one such solution, the seguid database  <cit> , creates and records unique identifiers  for over  <dig> million distinct proteins based on their primary amino acid sequence using the secure hash algorithm digest .
two protein sequence records that describe proteins with the same primary sequence will have the same unique sha- <dig> identifier and will therefore be assigned to the same redundant group.
we chose to employ this existing method and resource as the basis of mapping protein identifiers to redundant groups for a number of reasons.
first, the definition of redundancy is based solely on sequence.
this forms a well-defined, baseline solution that is not subject to interpretation.
second, anyone can generate these keys using only sequence data and an algorithm .
this facilitates accessibility to the solution.
third, the sha- <dig> algorithm provides for  <dig> e <dig> possible unique keys.
this number is significantly higher than other digest algorithms  and therefore provides further protection against collisions .
our construction of a protein interaction index involved parsing psi-mi files provided by nine interaction databases including bind  <cit> , biogrid  <cit> , dip  <cit> , hprd  <cit> , intact  <cit> , mint  <cit> , mpact  <cit> , mppi  <cit>  and ophid  <cit> .
mapping proteins  to redundant groups employed seguid-based keys and required addressing a number of issues including malformed and deprecated identifiers, incorrectly assigned taxonomy identifiers and resolution of ambiguous mappings.
methods used to make these assignments were recorded allowing for a detailed examination of potential problems with source records and our own system.
this paper describes the software system and the consolidated interaction dataset that it constructs.
we demonstrate the utility of the data set and argue that the method is suited well to integrating high-throughput proteomics studies with existing interaction knowledge.
we also suggest that the resulting index could provide useful feedback and search capabilities to source databases.
interaction data that may be publicly redistributed under the license agreement of the source database is indexed by the irefindex  and made freely available in taxon-specific divisions via anonymous ftp in the psi-mitab  <dig>  tab-delimited, text format.
RESULTS
the non-redundant index of interactions was constructed in four steps summarized here and described further in the following sections.
first, sha- <dig> digest sequence identifiers  for proteins were compiled from several sources and were cross-referenced with the source database and most recent accession and taxonomy identifiers for the protein sequence record.
second, interaction data were compiled from several sources and compiled in a single relational database.
third, for each protein interactor in each interaction record, a redundant object group  was assigned using the seguid and taxonomy identifier for the protein.
fourth, each protein-protein binary interaction or complex was assigned to a redundant interaction group  on the basis of the rog assignments made above.
the number of distinct interaction records was examined for each source database and for each of several taxons.
<dig>  seguid's
sequence globally unique identifiers   <cit>  were employed to provide a unique key for each protein in the interaction dataset that was independent of the source database and accession used to describe the protein.
this key may be derived by external groups using only the primary amino acid sequence and the algorithm described below.
this key was used to map protein accessions used in interaction records to redundant groups and, in turn, group together redundant interaction records.
the algorithm for the creation of a seguid has been described previously  <cit> .
briefly, an amino acid sequence in single-letter code is converted to upper case after all non-letter characters and trailing or leading spaces are removed.
the secure hash algorithm <cit>   is used to construct a 160-bit message digest of this amino acid sequence; we used the java.security.
message library implementation of sha- <dig>  this digest was converted to the base <dig> representation using the base <dig> java class   <cit> .
all trailing ""="" characters used for padding were removed to yield the final  <dig> character long seguid string.
seguid's may also be derived from primary amino acid sequence using the web interface and services provided by the seguid database  <cit> .
in addition, pre-calculated seguid's and their mapping to various protein database accessions, aliases and fasta files can be directly downloaded from the seguid ftp site.
seguid's may be used to refer to a group of accessions that all refer to the same primary amino acid sequence .
since two proteins in two different organisms may share the same sequence, we also employed a rog  identifier to distinguish between identical protein sequences in different organisms.
a rog identifier consists of a seguid string concatenated with the ncbi taxonomy identifier  <cit> .
so, for instance, while the proteins pointed to by accessions refseq: np_ <dig> and uniprot:q3yuu <dig> belong to the same redundant sequence group  these proteins belong to different rog's .
<dig>  initial compilation of molecular interaction data
interaction records were retrieved from nine different sources and a number of elements from each record were parsed to a relational database .
in total,  <dig>  records were retrieved including  <dig>  records where all described interacting elements  were proteins.
the elements parsed from each record included the source interaction database and accession for the interaction record .
each interaction record typically contains two interactors ; however, many interaction records describe complexes where greater than two interactors are present.
in these cases, the record indicates that the interactors are all participants in some complex without specifying the individual binary interactions present between the interactors.
other interaction records contain only one interactor; these records represent multimeric complexes containing only one subunit type that is present in two or more copies.
in all cases, the interactors present in an interaction record were examined and an entry was made for each in the relational database.
no attempt was made at this point to consolidate redundant interactors; every interactor in every interaction record is considered a unique object in the relational database.
the entry for each of these interactors included:
<dig> complex2refs.txt
<dig> ints.txt
<dig> refs.txt
<dig> complexes.txt
<dig> labels.txt
1) a single primary reference describing the interactor in an external sequence database,
2) a list of secondary references that may also point to the interactor in an external sequence database,
3) an ncbi taxonomy identifier describing the source organism of the interactor,
and
4) the primary amino acid sequence of the protein interactor,
.
only the first element is mandatory under the psi-mi schema.
the other three elements were retrieved and recorded whenever present.
all four elements were used during the next stage of processing in an attempt to map the interactor to a redundant object group .
<dig>  mapping protein interactors to redundant object groups
the data retrieved for each interactor from each interaction record were used in the process outlined in figure  <dig> to assign a rog identifier to each protein interactor.
this process follows an order of preference for the data used to make the rog assignment.
an attempt at assignment is first made by using the primary reference provided in the interaction record.
if this fails, the secondary references provided in the interaction record are used.
if this fails, the protein's primary amino acid sequence is used .
the process ends as soon as a non-ambiguous assignment is made.
in the course of this assignment, a rog ""assignment score"" is generated; this is a nominal value that provides information on how the assignment was made.
the assignment score is composed of a set of features that may each have a value of  <dig> or  <dig>  a human readable version of this score is generated by representing each feature with a value of  <dig> with a single character unique to that feature.
these characters and their mappings to assignment score features are listed in table  <dig>  as an example, the score represented by ""puo+"" indicates that the assignment was made using the primary accession  from the interaction record, that the accession required updating , and that there were more than one  possible updated accessions but only one of these accessions pointed to a sequence that was identical to the original  sequence listed in the interaction record.
in effect, assignment scores are associated with a path through our workflow.
a number of scores are possible when using our workflow.
these possible scores are listed in figure  <dig> and scores that were actually observed are underlined.
1total number of assignment scores where this occurs expressed as a percentage of all assignments .
<dig>  detailed description of the assignment process
each logical block in the assignment process is represented in figure  <dig> and is further described below.
a: using the primary reference
the assignment process begins with a consideration of the primary protein reference given by the interaction record.
the reference consists of an external database identifier  and an accession pointing to a record in that database .
the taxonomy identifier for the protein is also considered.
if the accession is found in the uniprot partition of the seguid table with the expected taxonomy identifier, then the protein interactor is assigned the corresponding seguid and rog identifiers with an assignment score of ""p"".
seventy nine percent of all assignments were made using the primary reference .
the external database or taxon provided by the interaction record may be ambiguous .
in these cases, database  and/or taxon  criteria may be relaxed in searching the seguid table; the assignment is made with the corresponding score .
unexpected database names are only tolerated when the provided protein accession is alphanumeric.
unexpected taxon identifiers are always tolerated.
in all cases, these discrepancies are recorded along with the expected database name and/or taxon.
in some cases, the accession found in the interaction record may require modification in order to find a matching entry in the seguid table .
for example, minor typographical changes are allowed  or the version number of an accession is ignored .
these cases are indicated by score characters m and v respectively.
lastly, protein references are associated with a ""type"" that may be either ""identity"" or ""see also"".
the later indicates that the reference does not point to a record about the interactor's sequence but to a record where additional information can be retrieved about the protein.
in a few rare cases, the primary reference was of the type ""see also"".
assignments were made with these references and marked by the score character q .
b: updating accessions
protein sequence records from uniprot may be altered over time.
in some cases, the new record will receive a new primary accession and the old accession will be included in the new record as a secondary accession.
it is also possible that a sequence record may be used to make more than one new sequence record.
in these cases, the old accession will appear as a secondary accession in each of the new records  <cit> .
our work-flow checks for these cases.
in the event that a uniprot accession for a protein  is not found in the seguid table, an attempt is made to update the accession.
this is accomplished by searching for uniprot records that list the interaction-record-provided accession as a secondary accession.
if only a single record is found, the uniprot primary accession in this record is taken as the updated accession.
the corresponding assignment score will contain a u .
on the other hand, it is possible that more than one record is found and that these records describe different protein sequences .
in this case, the mapping from the interaction-record-provided accession to an updated accession is said to be ambiguous.
this ambiguity may be resolved in block g using the protein's sequence when provided by the interaction record .
ncbi accessions do not require an analogous logical block.
an ncbi accession follows a sequence record for its lifetime.
changes in the sequence are indicated by changes to its version number and its primary geninfo identifier   <cit> .
the assignment process considers ncbi accessions and will ignore version information where provided .
in the case that gi's or protein databank identifiers are provided, entrez programming utilities   <cit>  are used to retrieve the genbank or refseq accession.
corresponding assignment scores will contain the letter i to indicate a gi was used and the letter e to indicate that eutils were used.
in summary, an attempt is always made by the assignment process to update the protein's reference to its most recent version.
c: using gene identifiers
in the event that the primary accession is still not found in the seguid table and the accession provided is an entrez geneid  <cit> , the protein accessions corresponding to the gene are retrieved.
in the best case, only one protein product is present and its taxonomy identifier matches the one given in the interaction record; the assignment score will contain a g. this block also allows for a relaxed taxon match during search of the seguid table .
in the event that more than one protein is encoded by the gene, the assignment may be made using the protein's sequence when provided by the interaction record .
d, e, f: using secondary references
in those cases where an assignment cannot be made using the primary reference provided by the interaction record, the secondary references are consulted.
corresponding assignment scores will contain the letter s. these three blocks of code essentially follow the same logic as their analogous blocks for the primary reference .
only those secondary identifiers with the type ""identity"" are considered in these steps.
these blocks also account for the possibility that the set of secondary references may point to more than one protein .
this ambiguity may be resolved in block g using the protein's sequence.
g: resolving ambiguities using interaction record provided sequence
this logical block attempts to resolve ambiguous assignments that may have arisen in the above blocks by using the protein sequence .
this case is marked in the assignment score by the character ""+"" and may be resolved if the seguid for the sequence  matches one  of the possible assignments .
h: resolving ambiguities using arbitrary methods
this logical block makes an arbitrary assignment where more than one assignment is possible and the ambiguity could not be resolved by using the protein sequence .
this case is marked in the score by the character ""+"" and may be arbitrarily resolved by choosing the assignment that has the expected taxonomy identifier  or by simply choosing the assignment with the largest seguid .
the largest seguid is determined as the last in a list of seguid strings that have been sorted in ascending lexicographical order .
arbitrary assignment is a stop gap measure and assignments with scores containing l or x  should be treated with caution .
i: using interaction record sequences and archival sequences
in the event that no assignment is possible , but the interaction record lists a sequence, the seguid is calculated for the sequence and a new entry is made in the seguid table .
the interactor is assigned to the corresponding rog.
likewise, if a protein reference can be used to retrieve an archived  sequence from eutils, the seguid is calculated for the sequence and a new  entry is made in the seguid table.
this mechanism serves as a stop-gap measure .

<dig>  review of assignment scores
type  <dig> assignments were least problematic.
in all cases, an unambiguous assignment to a rog was possible using either a primary or secondary reference .
in a few cases, version information was ignored , the source database  was relaxed or minor modifications  to the accession were allowed in order to find the corresponding entry in our seguid table.
in total, type  <dig> assignments accounted for 77% of the assignments made.
type  <dig> assignments required that the accession provided by the source database be updated using either uniprot secondary accessions  or ncbi eutils .
in all cases, an unambiguous assignment was made.
in a few cases, the sequence provided by the interaction database was required to accomplish this .
in total, type  <dig> assignments accounted for 3% of the assignments made.
there is likely always to be some asynchrony between interaction database releases and the major sequence databases; the ability to map accessions to their most recent versions is therefore an essential component of any integrative effort.
type  <dig> assignments involved references where the taxonomy identifier provided by the interaction database was different than the 'true' taxon provided by the source sequence record.
type  <dig> assignments represent those rare cases where both an update to an accession was required and the true taxonomy identifier was different than expected.
type  <dig> and  <dig> cases accounted for 16% of all assignments and were typically the result of the interaction record listing a taxon that is parental to the true taxon .
for the most part, this practice was not a problem for our purposes because the protein reference pointed to a single sequence record where the 'true' taxonomy identifier was listed.
however, these differences must be carefully considered when analyzing data or when designing search strategies based on taxonomy identifiers.
type  <dig> assignments involved references that could be mapped to a number of different proteins  and that could not be resolved using sequence data provided in the record.
in some cases, this was resolved by choosing the rog that had the expected taxonomy identifier  or by the arbitrary method of choosing the assignment with the largest seguid  according to its ascii value.
the majority of cases arose from use of internal identifiers for the protein's primary reference and where the list of alternative secondary accessions pointed to multiple proteins.
psi-mi guidelines suggest that proteins be represented with stable identifiers such as uniprotkb or refseq accessions  <cit>  and our results would recommend that distribution of internal identifiers in psi-mi files be avoided.
this would have been possible in the majority of cases.
in a few cases, retired uniprot accessions were found that had been split into several new records.
the correct mapping was not discernable even when taking into account taxon and sequence information present in the interaction record .
ambiguity also arose from the use of entrezgene identifiers that point to multiple protein products.
finally, type  <dig> assignments involved interactors for which no matching reference or sequence existed in our seguid table.
the protein sequence provided by the interaction record  was used to construct a new  seguid entry.
this served to group together any other interactors that might have the same sequence in the current build of the index.
this is a stop-gap measure and new seguid entries are discarded from one build of the database to another.
the majority of these cases are due to ncbi accessions that have been retired and for which mappings to new accessions are non-existent and not easily automated .
this discontinuity between related sequences is a limitation of ncbi accession use.
in some cases, uniprot accessions circumvent this problem by providing secondary  accessions in active records as a built-in history of the sequence; however, in cases where sequence records are split, this may lead to multiple mappings that are not easily disambiguated .
on the other hand, the ncbi accession.version and geninfo system allows for simple and unambiguous updating of a sequence while the accession is active  assignments).
in the end, there is no perfect system and integrating data will be dependent on updates and clarifications from source databases.
in summary, our method has allowed us to unambiguously map 96% of all protein interactors to redundant object groups .
the remaining 4% of proteins are problematic either because our mappings are ambiguous  or because we are unable to make any mapping at all to a current sequences .
these identifiers will be the subject of further investigation with the source databases.
the protein identifier cross-reference service  <cit>  was released while this project was under development; implementation of this resource provides access to uniparc sequences and may resolve some of these unassigned identifiers.
table  <dig> results have been broken down by database and will be made available to interested source databases.
<dig>  mapping protein-protein binary interactions and complexes to redundant interaction groups
each interaction record involving only protein interactors was assigned to a redundant interaction group  on the basis of the rog assignments made above.
a rig identifier  is constructed by concatenating rog identifiers , applying the sha- <dig> algorithm to the resulting string, converting the digest to its base <dig> representation and removing all trailing ""="" characters used for padding .
the rigid constitutes a unique and universal pointer to a set of interaction or complex records that all involve the same proteins from the same organism.
table  <dig> summarizes our efforts to map source interaction data to redundant interaction groups.
in total, we collected  <dig>  interaction records that involved only proteins.
99% of these were assigned rog's for each interactor and the corresponding rig was calculated.
in total, we found  <dig>  rigid's corresponding to distinct interactions.
<dig>   of these corresponded to binary protein interactions,  <dig>   to complexes involving  <dig> or more proteins and  <dig>   to interactions involving only one interactor type .
only 44% of the rigid assignments represented distinct interactions or complexes.
this redundancy in the consolidated dataset was higher than the redundancy within any given source  suggesting that there was a fair amount of redundancy between datasets.
we examined pairs of source datasets  and showed that this was the case.
there were no examples of one data source completely subsuming another.
in fact, each source possesses a large number of distinct interactions.
this further illustrates the need for a consolidated dataset.
at the same time, this demonstrates that a user searching for interaction information using a number of web-site interfaces would be overcome with redundant interactions; many of these redundancies are not apparent by a visual inspection of the records especially when different protein identifier schemes are used.

1at least one interactor in the counted rig's has this taxonomy identifier according to either the source sequence record or source interaction record.
utility of consolidated data
a great deal of interaction data is derived from high-throughput methods based on co-immunoprecipitation with a tagged bait protein.
these data result in ""complex"" interaction records with many interactors where the interactions between specific protein subunits remain unknown.
consolidation of these complex data with pair wise interaction data allows for the development of a more complete picture of the potential biological complexes.
figure  <dig> shows a bi-partite graph where a complex record is represented with a closed circle and protein members of this complex are indicated by open circles and adjoining edges to the complex node.
the clustering coefficient of this complex will approach  <dig> as all potential interactions between members are met by pair wise interactions from the consolidated database.
the complex represented is the alternative ctf18-dcc1-ctf8-replication factor c complex and was observed using affinity purification methods  <cit> .
evidence for  <dig> of the  <dig> pair wise interactions between its protein members is provided by  <dig> interactions databases including  <dig> interactions found only in ophid and  <dig> interactions that are only found in hprd.
this example illustrates the utility of combining data from multiple sources while treating pair wise and complex interaction data as separate but complementary data types.
this subject has been explored in detail with methods proposed by scholtens and gentleman demonstrating how data from affinity purification and yeast two-hybrid experiments can be combined to form a more complete picture of potential complexes  <cit> .
we suggest that data from the irefindex would be amenable to this same type of analysis since it includes both complex and binary interaction data in a single non-redundant index.
the non-redundant nature of our data set has also allowed us to classify interactions based on supporting literature.
pubmed identifiers  listed in interaction records point to literature references that support an interaction.
a pmid may be used to support more than one interaction.
the lpr score  is the lowest number of unique interactions that are supported by one of the interaction's pmid's.
an lpr value of one would indicate that at least one of the pmid's supporting the interaction has never been used to support any other interaction and that the interaction is not likely to rely solely on high-throughput data.
figure  <dig> shows a distribution of interactions according to their lpr.
these data show a bi-modal distribution where 38% of all distinct interactions are supported by low-throughput papers .
these interactions may be taken  to be more reliable than those relying solely on high-throughput data.
in contrast, 46% of interactions have an lpr greater than  <dig> and can be considered high throughput.
the long body of the distribution contains ""middle throughput"" interactions  composing 16% of all distinct interactions.
the publicly distributable subset of the irefindex is available in a psi-mitab  <dig>  tab-delimited text file under a creative commons license .
this format allows for the types of analyses described above.
discussion
this paper presents a detailed description of methods used to consolidate protein interaction data from a variety of sources.
we have paid special attention to describing exactly how assignments to redundant groups have been made.
our goals have been three-fold.
first, we hope that this resource will be used by source interaction databases to identify problem records and improve data accessibility.
second, we believe that a non-redundant dataset is essential to future work .
third, we have presented methods to generate global keys for protein interactions and complexes.
redundancy can be defined in a number of ways.
we have chosen to define rog's based on exact sequence and taxonomy identifier match.
rog's may be further grouped into larger redundant groups that include all products derived from a single gene or proteins that are very similar in sequence.
we could have based rog's on gene identifiers to begin with; but, we do not believe that this is the best possible course for three reasons.
first, not all proteins are easily mapped to entrez gene identifiers.
second, many genes encode redundant protein products.
finally, mapping an interaction to a set of gene identifiers suggests that all products of those genes are involved in the interaction.
once this generalization has been made, there is no way back to specify that some pairs of gene products do not interact.
additionally, the methods suggested here allow external groups to generate universal rig's and rog's for their own data sets and integrate them with this dataset.
they may then choose to further redefine redundancy according to their own purposes.
as an example, modelling the structure of large macromolecular complexes such as the nuclear pore complex  <cit>  is dependent on information from a collection of sources  that helps constrain possible structure solutions.
interaction data for complex structure components may be collected from a variety of databases using our index.
further these data may be supplemented with interaction data for analogous components in a range of organisms.
these protein components may have low to near sequence similarity to the modelled components; their interactions could be easily overlaid with the modelled complex using a simple perl script and file that maps analogous proteins into the same redundant object group.
as further example, recent work has shown that genes associated with complex diseases tend to cluster in the human interaction network  <cit> .
again, these clusters could be supplemented with interaction information from analogous gene products in other organisms.
locating these interactions is facilitated using a list of sequence-related rog identifiers since they are independent of the protein database references used to construct the original interaction records.
our experience suggests that the casual user of interaction data would find it practically impossible to collect and consolidate interaction data using web-interfaces to the numerous source databases.
in addition, the effort expended in setting up and optimizing this system suggests that the task is also inaccessible to most bioinformatics groups unless they are dedicated to analyzing interaction data .
the present index provides useful access to a non-redundant view of interaction data using updated protein identifiers and corrected taxonomy identifiers.
this paper represents more than a year of development time but is still a work in progress that will require further dialogue with the source databases.
in the mean time, users are advised to keep in mind a number of cautionary points.
first, no assessment was made of the accuracy of source records.
source records and literature references should be consulted for further details.
we have assumed that protein references listed in interaction records represent those interactors described in the primary literature.
in truth, in some cases, the authors of this primary literature themselves may be uncertain of the identity of the exact gene products or protein isoforms that mediate the interaction.
in other cases, authors may reference proteins using only a name with no database reference.
there is no allowance  within the psi-mi specification to deal with such ambiguity and different databases deal with this problem in different ways.
biogrid, for instance, intentionally curates interactions at the gene level; all of the protein products for an interactor's gene may be listed within an interaction record.
this practice led to a number of ambiguous assignments for biogrid interactors.
members of the imex consortium adhere to published curation guidelines and we would suggest that other databases also publish their guidelines.
guidelines will understandably differ ; making these guidelines transparent is an essential part of providing access to data.
second, psi-mi xml is a means of exchanging data.
it does not guarantee uniform representation of meaning.
for instance, some experimental methods  will result in ""complex data"".
intact psi-mi xml records will represent these data as a list of multiple interactors in a single interaction.
this ""complex"" grouping carries no information about the binary interactions between member proteins or about their stoichiometry.
in contrast, biogrid will represent complex data using a series of binary interactions with one ""hub"" interactor in common where the hub may be a tagged ""bait"" protein used to immunoprecipitate other proteins from an extract .
the later representation implies binary interactions that may not exist and runs the risk of confounding complexes that share a common ""hub"".
the intact method is more amenable to our bi-partite representation in figure  <dig> where complexes are represented by a separate node type.
these differences in representation may be accounted for during analysis or possibly even normalized prior to analysis.
again, publication of curation guidelines is an important first step towards this.
at present, the irefindex psi-mitab file preserves complex information where it is present in the source record.
in the near future, we hope to collaborate with members of the imex consortium to create a reference index of all publicly available interaction data.
the two biogrid examples given above came to light after soliciting feedback from all source databases on our results; other examples are certain to follow.
eventually, the issues identified by this process can be built into checks carried out by the psi-mi validator  <cit>  to avoid recurrence of these problems by databases and data submitters.
providing a web interface to these data is an obvious priority.
we believe this would be best accomplished by providing a programmatic web-services interface to our data.
this would allow source databases and applications such as cytoscape to provide a user interface to these data that would re-direct users to the appropriate source database.
a common query interface was proposed at the recent hupo-psi meeting in toledo, spain and development is in progress on its implementation by each of the databases  <cit> .
finally, our index has the ability to consolidate interaction records derived from a common publication by multiple source databases.
this view would facilitate cross-checking between databases where such duplications exist.
further, this view may help in the process of normalizing the representation of interactions using common standards and controlled vocabulary.
this process is expected to be most important for legacy records predating the  <dig> imex consortium agreement.
CONCLUSIONS
the irefindex dataset represents a carefully constructed non-redundant index of interaction data.
this resource has numerous applications and may form the basis of further efforts to improve access to information and to normalize representation of interactions.
",55,"BACKGROUND
protein interaction data are an increasingly important bioinformatics dataset used in biomedical research. these data are generated by a multitude of methods including both high-throughput and more traditional low-throughput proteomics studies  <cit>  as well as in silico predictions based on known interactions  <cit> .

the past several years have seen a proliferation of interaction databases as the field focuses on ways to collect these data into machine readable formats where they may be more easily computed on and reliably exchanged between users. the international molecular exchange   <cit>  represents one effort to consolidate efforts of interaction databases by facilitating exchange of information between primary databases according to an agreed standard exchange language called the human proteome organization's proteomics standards initiative molecular interaction format   <cit> . archival members of imex agree to share and provide a full dataset of globally available imex molecular interaction records  in a manner similar to the international nucleotide sequence database collaboration   <cit> . imex also serves to coordinate curation tasks between the partner databases to avoid redundant efforts. imex is open to new members and is comprised of five active partners including dip  <cit> , intact  <cit> , mint  <cit> , mpact  <cit>  and biogrid  <cit> .

the potential for new imex members is enormous: one recent compilation of protein-protein interaction resources listed over  <dig> databases  <cit> . this large list represents a lively interest in interaction data; it also represents a problem for the user searching for information since there is no unifying index.

we set out to create such an index with two goals in mind; first the index should be capable of grouping together equivalent protein interactions into a single group. the measure of equivalence should be based on exact sequence matches of the protein participants according to the source record without further interpretation based on, for example, encoding genes or near sequence identity. second, operations performed to map protein and interaction records to these redundant groups should be preserved; this would allow for the mapping to be recreated for data integrity checking and would help identify and classify potential problem records.

presently, imex archival databases provide a complete set of records generated by its members; however, these records are meant to be archival and do not resolve redundancies between records. this becomes problematic when trying to compile a non-redundant list of interactors for a given protein especially when records may use different identifiers to describe the same protein. a number of recent studies have addressed this issue and reported on databases and/or software that aim to generate consolidated interaction data sets from primary interaction databases . mimi groups together redundant protein interactors and redundant interactions using ""keyless identity functions"" and ""deep merging""; however, these methods are never explicitly defined  <cit> . piana software also allows for integration of protein interaction data from multiple sources and apparently resolves redundancies between different protein identifier types; again, the methods used to do this are never explicitly defined  <cit> . cpath software also allows users to integrate protein interaction data from multiple sources. redundant proteins are identified using lookup tables that may be defined by the user  <cit> ; however, identical interactions and complexes are not grouped together. the solution presented in this study is unique in that it uses a well-defined, reproducible method to assign distinct identifiers to each distinct protein and to each distinct interaction and/or complex in which the protein participates. our method is also unique in that it was designed to trace this process and provide feedback to source databases on problematic assignments.

mapping protein identifiers to redundant groups is at the heart of this task and a number of solutions exist . one such solution, the seguid database  <cit> , creates and records unique identifiers  for over  <dig> million distinct proteins based on their primary amino acid sequence using the secure hash algorithm digest . two protein sequence records that describe proteins with the same primary sequence will have the same unique sha- <dig> identifier and will therefore be assigned to the same redundant group. we chose to employ this existing method and resource as the basis of mapping protein identifiers to redundant groups for a number of reasons. first, the definition of redundancy is based solely on sequence. this forms a well-defined, baseline solution that is not subject to interpretation. second, anyone can generate these keys using only sequence data and an algorithm . this facilitates accessibility to the solution. third, the sha- <dig> algorithm provides for  <dig> e <dig> possible unique keys. this number is significantly higher than other digest algorithms  and therefore provides further protection against collisions .

our construction of a protein interaction index involved parsing psi-mi files provided by nine interaction databases including bind  <cit> , biogrid  <cit> , dip  <cit> , hprd  <cit> , intact  <cit> , mint  <cit> , mpact  <cit> , mppi  <cit>  and ophid  <cit> . mapping proteins  to redundant groups employed seguid-based keys and required addressing a number of issues including malformed and deprecated identifiers, incorrectly assigned taxonomy identifiers and resolution of ambiguous mappings. methods used to make these assignments were recorded allowing for a detailed examination of potential problems with source records and our own system.

this paper describes the software system and the consolidated interaction dataset that it constructs. we demonstrate the utility of the data set and argue that the method is suited well to integrating high-throughput proteomics studies with existing interaction knowledge. we also suggest that the resulting index could provide useful feedback and search capabilities to source databases. interaction data that may be publicly redistributed under the license agreement of the source database is indexed by the irefindex  and made freely available in taxon-specific divisions via anonymous ftp in the psi-mitab  <dig>  tab-delimited, text format.

RESULTS
the non-redundant index of interactions was constructed in four steps summarized here and described further in the following sections. first, sha- <dig> digest sequence identifiers  for proteins were compiled from several sources and were cross-referenced with the source database and most recent accession and taxonomy identifiers for the protein sequence record. second, interaction data were compiled from several sources and compiled in a single relational database. third, for each protein interactor in each interaction record, a redundant object group  was assigned using the seguid and taxonomy identifier for the protein. fourth, each protein-protein binary interaction or complex was assigned to a redundant interaction group  on the basis of the rog assignments made above. the number of distinct interaction records was examined for each source database and for each of several taxons.

 <dig>  seguid's
sequence globally unique identifiers   <cit>  were employed to provide a unique key for each protein in the interaction dataset that was independent of the source database and accession used to describe the protein. this key may be derived by external groups using only the primary amino acid sequence and the algorithm described below. this key was used to map protein accessions used in interaction records to redundant groups and, in turn, group together redundant interaction records.

the algorithm for the creation of a seguid has been described previously  <cit> . briefly, an amino acid sequence in single-letter code is converted to upper case after all non-letter characters and trailing or leading spaces are removed. the secure hash algorithm <cit>   is used to construct a 160-bit message digest of this amino acid sequence; we used the java.security. message library implementation of sha- <dig>  this digest was converted to the base <dig> representation using the base <dig> java class   <cit> . all trailing ""="" characters used for padding were removed to yield the final  <dig> character long seguid string. seguid's may also be derived from primary amino acid sequence using the web interface and services provided by the seguid database  <cit> . in addition, pre-calculated seguid's and their mapping to various protein database accessions, aliases and fasta files can be directly downloaded from the seguid ftp site. seguid's may be used to refer to a group of accessions that all refer to the same primary amino acid sequence . since two proteins in two different organisms may share the same sequence, we also employed a rog  identifier to distinguish between identical protein sequences in different organisms. a rog identifier consists of a seguid string concatenated with the ncbi taxonomy identifier  <cit> . so, for instance, while the proteins pointed to by accessions refseq: np_ <dig> and uniprot:q3yuu <dig> belong to the same redundant sequence group  these proteins belong to different rog's .

 <dig>  initial compilation of molecular interaction data
interaction records were retrieved from nine different sources and a number of elements from each record were parsed to a relational database . in total,  <dig>  records were retrieved including  <dig>  records where all described interacting elements  were proteins. the elements parsed from each record included the source interaction database and accession for the interaction record . each interaction record typically contains two interactors ; however, many interaction records describe complexes where greater than two interactors are present. in these cases, the record indicates that the interactors are all participants in some complex without specifying the individual binary interactions present between the interactors. other interaction records contain only one interactor; these records represent multimeric complexes containing only one subunit type that is present in two or more copies. in all cases, the interactors present in an interaction record were examined and an entry was made for each in the relational database. no attempt was made at this point to consolidate redundant interactors; every interactor in every interaction record is considered a unique object in the relational database. the entry for each of these interactors included:

 <dig> complex2refs.txt
 <dig> ints.txt
 <dig> refs.txt
 <dig> complexes.txt
 <dig> labels.txt
1) a single primary reference describing the interactor in an external sequence database,



2) a list of secondary references that may also point to the interactor in an external sequence database, 

3) an ncbi taxonomy identifier describing the source organism of the interactor,

 and

4) the primary amino acid sequence of the protein interactor,

.

only the first element is mandatory under the psi-mi schema. the other three elements were retrieved and recorded whenever present. all four elements were used during the next stage of processing in an attempt to map the interactor to a redundant object group .

 <dig>  mapping protein interactors to redundant object groups 
the data retrieved for each interactor from each interaction record were used in the process outlined in figure  <dig> to assign a rog identifier to each protein interactor. this process follows an order of preference for the data used to make the rog assignment. an attempt at assignment is first made by using the primary reference provided in the interaction record. if this fails, the secondary references provided in the interaction record are used. if this fails, the protein's primary amino acid sequence is used . the process ends as soon as a non-ambiguous assignment is made.

in the course of this assignment, a rog ""assignment score"" is generated; this is a nominal value that provides information on how the assignment was made. the assignment score is composed of a set of features that may each have a value of  <dig> or  <dig>  a human readable version of this score is generated by representing each feature with a value of  <dig> with a single character unique to that feature. these characters and their mappings to assignment score features are listed in table  <dig>  as an example, the score represented by ""puo+"" indicates that the assignment was made using the primary accession  from the interaction record, that the accession required updating , and that there were more than one  possible updated accessions but only one of these accessions pointed to a sequence that was identical to the original  sequence listed in the interaction record. in effect, assignment scores are associated with a path through our workflow. a number of scores are possible when using our workflow. these possible scores are listed in figure  <dig> and scores that were actually observed are underlined.

1total number of assignment scores where this occurs expressed as a percentage of all assignments .

 <dig>  detailed description of the assignment process
each logical block in the assignment process is represented in figure  <dig> and is further described below.

a: using the primary reference
the assignment process begins with a consideration of the primary protein reference given by the interaction record. the reference consists of an external database identifier  and an accession pointing to a record in that database . the taxonomy identifier for the protein is also considered. if the accession is found in the uniprot partition of the seguid table with the expected taxonomy identifier, then the protein interactor is assigned the corresponding seguid and rog identifiers with an assignment score of ""p"". seventy nine percent of all assignments were made using the primary reference . the external database or taxon provided by the interaction record may be ambiguous . in these cases, database  and/or taxon  criteria may be relaxed in searching the seguid table; the assignment is made with the corresponding score . unexpected database names are only tolerated when the provided protein accession is alphanumeric. unexpected taxon identifiers are always tolerated. in all cases, these discrepancies are recorded along with the expected database name and/or taxon. in some cases, the accession found in the interaction record may require modification in order to find a matching entry in the seguid table . for example, minor typographical changes are allowed  or the version number of an accession is ignored . these cases are indicated by score characters m and v respectively. lastly, protein references are associated with a ""type"" that may be either ""identity"" or ""see also"". the later indicates that the reference does not point to a record about the interactor's sequence but to a record where additional information can be retrieved about the protein. in a few rare cases, the primary reference was of the type ""see also"". assignments were made with these references and marked by the score character q .

b: updating accessions
protein sequence records from uniprot may be altered over time. in some cases, the new record will receive a new primary accession and the old accession will be included in the new record as a secondary accession. it is also possible that a sequence record may be used to make more than one new sequence record. in these cases, the old accession will appear as a secondary accession in each of the new records  <cit> . our work-flow checks for these cases. in the event that a uniprot accession for a protein  is not found in the seguid table, an attempt is made to update the accession. this is accomplished by searching for uniprot records that list the interaction-record-provided accession as a secondary accession. if only a single record is found, the uniprot primary accession in this record is taken as the updated accession. the corresponding assignment score will contain a u . on the other hand, it is possible that more than one record is found and that these records describe different protein sequences . in this case, the mapping from the interaction-record-provided accession to an updated accession is said to be ambiguous. this ambiguity may be resolved in block g using the protein's sequence when provided by the interaction record .

ncbi accessions do not require an analogous logical block. an ncbi accession follows a sequence record for its lifetime. changes in the sequence are indicated by changes to its version number and its primary geninfo identifier   <cit> . the assignment process considers ncbi accessions and will ignore version information where provided . in the case that gi's or protein databank identifiers are provided, entrez programming utilities   <cit>  are used to retrieve the genbank or refseq accession. corresponding assignment scores will contain the letter i to indicate a gi was used and the letter e to indicate that eutils were used. in summary, an attempt is always made by the assignment process to update the protein's reference to its most recent version.

c: using gene identifiers
in the event that the primary accession is still not found in the seguid table and the accession provided is an entrez geneid  <cit> , the protein accessions corresponding to the gene are retrieved. in the best case, only one protein product is present and its taxonomy identifier matches the one given in the interaction record; the assignment score will contain a g. this block also allows for a relaxed taxon match during search of the seguid table . in the event that more than one protein is encoded by the gene, the assignment may be made using the protein's sequence when provided by the interaction record .

d, e, f: using secondary references
in those cases where an assignment cannot be made using the primary reference provided by the interaction record, the secondary references are consulted. corresponding assignment scores will contain the letter s. these three blocks of code essentially follow the same logic as their analogous blocks for the primary reference . only those secondary identifiers with the type ""identity"" are considered in these steps. these blocks also account for the possibility that the set of secondary references may point to more than one protein . this ambiguity may be resolved in block g using the protein's sequence.

g: resolving ambiguities using interaction record provided sequence
this logical block attempts to resolve ambiguous assignments that may have arisen in the above blocks by using the protein sequence . this case is marked in the assignment score by the character ""+"" and may be resolved if the seguid for the sequence  matches one  of the possible assignments .

h: resolving ambiguities using arbitrary methods
this logical block makes an arbitrary assignment where more than one assignment is possible and the ambiguity could not be resolved by using the protein sequence . this case is marked in the score by the character ""+"" and may be arbitrarily resolved by choosing the assignment that has the expected taxonomy identifier  or by simply choosing the assignment with the largest seguid . the largest seguid is determined as the last in a list of seguid strings that have been sorted in ascending lexicographical order . arbitrary assignment is a stop gap measure and assignments with scores containing l or x  should be treated with caution .

i: using interaction record sequences and archival sequences
in the event that no assignment is possible , but the interaction record lists a sequence, the seguid is calculated for the sequence and a new entry is made in the seguid table . the interactor is assigned to the corresponding rog. likewise, if a protein reference can be used to retrieve an archived  sequence from eutils, the seguid is calculated for the sequence and a new  entry is made in the seguid table. this mechanism serves as a stop-gap measure .

 <dig>  review of assignment scores
type  <dig> assignments were least problematic. in all cases, an unambiguous assignment to a rog was possible using either a primary or secondary reference . in a few cases, version information was ignored , the source database  was relaxed or minor modifications  to the accession were allowed in order to find the corresponding entry in our seguid table. in total, type  <dig> assignments accounted for 77% of the assignments made.

type  <dig> assignments required that the accession provided by the source database be updated using either uniprot secondary accessions  or ncbi eutils . in all cases, an unambiguous assignment was made. in a few cases, the sequence provided by the interaction database was required to accomplish this . in total, type  <dig> assignments accounted for 3% of the assignments made. there is likely always to be some asynchrony between interaction database releases and the major sequence databases; the ability to map accessions to their most recent versions is therefore an essential component of any integrative effort.

type  <dig> assignments involved references where the taxonomy identifier provided by the interaction database was different than the 'true' taxon provided by the source sequence record. type  <dig> assignments represent those rare cases where both an update to an accession was required and the true taxonomy identifier was different than expected. type  <dig> and  <dig> cases accounted for 16% of all assignments and were typically the result of the interaction record listing a taxon that is parental to the true taxon . for the most part, this practice was not a problem for our purposes because the protein reference pointed to a single sequence record where the 'true' taxonomy identifier was listed. however, these differences must be carefully considered when analyzing data or when designing search strategies based on taxonomy identifiers.

type  <dig> assignments involved references that could be mapped to a number of different proteins  and that could not be resolved using sequence data provided in the record. in some cases, this was resolved by choosing the rog that had the expected taxonomy identifier  or by the arbitrary method of choosing the assignment with the largest seguid  according to its ascii value. the majority of cases arose from use of internal identifiers for the protein's primary reference and where the list of alternative secondary accessions pointed to multiple proteins. psi-mi guidelines suggest that proteins be represented with stable identifiers such as uniprotkb or refseq accessions  <cit>  and our results would recommend that distribution of internal identifiers in psi-mi files be avoided. this would have been possible in the majority of cases. in a few cases, retired uniprot accessions were found that had been split into several new records. the correct mapping was not discernable even when taking into account taxon and sequence information present in the interaction record . ambiguity also arose from the use of entrezgene identifiers that point to multiple protein products.

finally, type  <dig> assignments involved interactors for which no matching reference or sequence existed in our seguid table. the protein sequence provided by the interaction record  was used to construct a new  seguid entry. this served to group together any other interactors that might have the same sequence in the current build of the index. this is a stop-gap measure and new seguid entries are discarded from one build of the database to another. the majority of these cases are due to ncbi accessions that have been retired and for which mappings to new accessions are non-existent and not easily automated . this discontinuity between related sequences is a limitation of ncbi accession use. in some cases, uniprot accessions circumvent this problem by providing secondary  accessions in active records as a built-in history of the sequence; however, in cases where sequence records are split, this may lead to multiple mappings that are not easily disambiguated . on the other hand, the ncbi accession.version and geninfo system allows for simple and unambiguous updating of a sequence while the accession is active  assignments). in the end, there is no perfect system and integrating data will be dependent on updates and clarifications from source databases.

in summary, our method has allowed us to unambiguously map 96% of all protein interactors to redundant object groups . the remaining 4% of proteins are problematic either because our mappings are ambiguous  or because we are unable to make any mapping at all to a current sequences . these identifiers will be the subject of further investigation with the source databases. the protein identifier cross-reference service  <cit>  was released while this project was under development; implementation of this resource provides access to uniparc sequences and may resolve some of these unassigned identifiers. table  <dig> results have been broken down by database and will be made available to interested source databases.

 <dig>  mapping protein-protein binary interactions and complexes to redundant interaction groups 
each interaction record involving only protein interactors was assigned to a redundant interaction group  on the basis of the rog assignments made above. a rig identifier  is constructed by concatenating rog identifiers , applying the sha- <dig> algorithm to the resulting string, converting the digest to its base <dig> representation and removing all trailing ""="" characters used for padding . the rigid constitutes a unique and universal pointer to a set of interaction or complex records that all involve the same proteins from the same organism. table  <dig> summarizes our efforts to map source interaction data to redundant interaction groups. in total, we collected  <dig>  interaction records that involved only proteins. 99% of these were assigned rog's for each interactor and the corresponding rig was calculated. in total, we found  <dig>  rigid's corresponding to distinct interactions.  <dig>   of these corresponded to binary protein interactions,  <dig>   to complexes involving  <dig> or more proteins and  <dig>   to interactions involving only one interactor type . only 44% of the rigid assignments represented distinct interactions or complexes. this redundancy in the consolidated dataset was higher than the redundancy within any given source  suggesting that there was a fair amount of redundancy between datasets. we examined pairs of source datasets  and showed that this was the case. there were no examples of one data source completely subsuming another. in fact, each source possesses a large number of distinct interactions. this further illustrates the need for a consolidated dataset. at the same time, this demonstrates that a user searching for interaction information using a number of web-site interfaces would be overcome with redundant interactions; many of these redundancies are not apparent by a visual inspection of the records especially when different protein identifier schemes are used.

utility of consolidated data
a great deal of interaction data is derived from high-throughput methods based on co-immunoprecipitation with a tagged bait protein. these data result in ""complex"" interaction records with many interactors where the interactions between specific protein subunits remain unknown. consolidation of these complex data with pair wise interaction data allows for the development of a more complete picture of the potential biological complexes. figure  <dig> shows a bi-partite graph where a complex record is represented with a closed circle and protein members of this complex are indicated by open circles and adjoining edges to the complex node. the clustering coefficient of this complex will approach  <dig> as all potential interactions between members are met by pair wise interactions from the consolidated database. the complex represented is the alternative ctf18-dcc1-ctf8-replication factor c complex and was observed using affinity purification methods  <cit> . evidence for  <dig> of the  <dig> pair wise interactions between its protein members is provided by  <dig> interactions databases including  <dig> interactions found only in ophid and  <dig> interactions that are only found in hprd. this example illustrates the utility of combining data from multiple sources while treating pair wise and complex interaction data as separate but complementary data types. this subject has been explored in detail with methods proposed by scholtens and gentleman demonstrating how data from affinity purification and yeast two-hybrid experiments can be combined to form a more complete picture of potential complexes  <cit> . we suggest that data from the irefindex would be amenable to this same type of analysis since it includes both complex and binary interaction data in a single non-redundant index.

the non-redundant nature of our data set has also allowed us to classify interactions based on supporting literature. pubmed identifiers  listed in interaction records point to literature references that support an interaction. a pmid may be used to support more than one interaction. the lpr score  is the lowest number of unique interactions that are supported by one of the interaction's pmid's. an lpr value of one would indicate that at least one of the pmid's supporting the interaction has never been used to support any other interaction and that the interaction is not likely to rely solely on high-throughput data. figure  <dig> shows a distribution of interactions according to their lpr. these data show a bi-modal distribution where 38% of all distinct interactions are supported by low-throughput papers . these interactions may be taken  to be more reliable than those relying solely on high-throughput data. in contrast, 46% of interactions have an lpr greater than  <dig> and can be considered high throughput. the long body of the distribution contains ""middle throughput"" interactions  composing 16% of all distinct interactions.

the publicly distributable subset of the irefindex is available in a psi-mitab  <dig>  tab-delimited text file under a creative commons license . this format allows for the types of analyses described above.

discussion
this paper presents a detailed description of methods used to consolidate protein interaction data from a variety of sources. we have paid special attention to describing exactly how assignments to redundant groups have been made. our goals have been three-fold. first, we hope that this resource will be used by source interaction databases to identify problem records and improve data accessibility. second, we believe that a non-redundant dataset is essential to future work . third, we have presented methods to generate global keys for protein interactions and complexes.

redundancy can be defined in a number of ways. we have chosen to define rog's based on exact sequence and taxonomy identifier match. rog's may be further grouped into larger redundant groups that include all products derived from a single gene or proteins that are very similar in sequence. we could have based rog's on gene identifiers to begin with; but, we do not believe that this is the best possible course for three reasons. first, not all proteins are easily mapped to entrez gene identifiers. second, many genes encode redundant protein products. finally, mapping an interaction to a set of gene identifiers suggests that all products of those genes are involved in the interaction. once this generalization has been made, there is no way back to specify that some pairs of gene products do not interact. additionally, the methods suggested here allow external groups to generate universal rig's and rog's for their own data sets and integrate them with this dataset. they may then choose to further redefine redundancy according to their own purposes.

as an example, modelling the structure of large macromolecular complexes such as the nuclear pore complex  <cit>  is dependent on information from a collection of sources  that helps constrain possible structure solutions. interaction data for complex structure components may be collected from a variety of databases using our index. further these data may be supplemented with interaction data for analogous components in a range of organisms. these protein components may have low to near sequence similarity to the modelled components; their interactions could be easily overlaid with the modelled complex using a simple perl script and file that maps analogous proteins into the same redundant object group. as further example, recent work has shown that genes associated with complex diseases tend to cluster in the human interaction network  <cit> . again, these clusters could be supplemented with interaction information from analogous gene products in other organisms. locating these interactions is facilitated using a list of sequence-related rog identifiers since they are independent of the protein database references used to construct the original interaction records.

our experience suggests that the casual user of interaction data would find it practically impossible to collect and consolidate interaction data using web-interfaces to the numerous source databases. in addition, the effort expended in setting up and optimizing this system suggests that the task is also inaccessible to most bioinformatics groups unless they are dedicated to analyzing interaction data .

the present index provides useful access to a non-redundant view of interaction data using updated protein identifiers and corrected taxonomy identifiers. this paper represents more than a year of development time but is still a work in progress that will require further dialogue with the source databases. in the mean time, users are advised to keep in mind a number of cautionary points.

first, no assessment was made of the accuracy of source records. source records and literature references should be consulted for further details. we have assumed that protein references listed in interaction records represent those interactors described in the primary literature. in truth, in some cases, the authors of this primary literature themselves may be uncertain of the identity of the exact gene products or protein isoforms that mediate the interaction. in other cases, authors may reference proteins using only a name with no database reference. there is no allowance  within the psi-mi specification to deal with such ambiguity and different databases deal with this problem in different ways. biogrid, for instance, intentionally curates interactions at the gene level; all of the protein products for an interactor's gene may be listed within an interaction record. this practice led to a number of ambiguous assignments for biogrid interactors. members of the imex consortium adhere to published curation guidelines and we would suggest that other databases also publish their guidelines. guidelines will understandably differ ; making these guidelines transparent is an essential part of providing access to data.

second, psi-mi xml is a means of exchanging data. it does not guarantee uniform representation of meaning. for instance, some experimental methods  will result in ""complex data"". intact psi-mi xml records will represent these data as a list of multiple interactors in a single interaction. this ""complex"" grouping carries no information about the binary interactions between member proteins or about their stoichiometry. in contrast, biogrid will represent complex data using a series of binary interactions with one ""hub"" interactor in common where the hub may be a tagged ""bait"" protein used to immunoprecipitate other proteins from an extract . the later representation implies binary interactions that may not exist and runs the risk of confounding complexes that share a common ""hub"". the intact method is more amenable to our bi-partite representation in figure  <dig> where complexes are represented by a separate node type. these differences in representation may be accounted for during analysis or possibly even normalized prior to analysis. again, publication of curation guidelines is an important first step towards this. at present, the irefindex psi-mitab file preserves complex information where it is present in the source record.

in the near future, we hope to collaborate with members of the imex consortium to create a reference index of all publicly available interaction data. the two biogrid examples given above came to light after soliciting feedback from all source databases on our results; other examples are certain to follow. eventually, the issues identified by this process can be built into checks carried out by the psi-mi validator  <cit>  to avoid recurrence of these problems by databases and data submitters.

providing a web interface to these data is an obvious priority. we believe this would be best accomplished by providing a programmatic web-services interface to our data. this would allow source databases and applications such as cytoscape to provide a user interface to these data that would re-direct users to the appropriate source database. a common query interface was proposed at the recent hupo-psi meeting in toledo, spain and development is in progress on its implementation by each of the databases  <cit> .

finally, our index has the ability to consolidate interaction records derived from a common publication by multiple source databases. this view would facilitate cross-checking between databases where such duplications exist. further, this view may help in the process of normalizing the representation of interactions using common standards and controlled vocabulary. this process is expected to be most important for legacy records predating the  <dig> imex consortium agreement.

"BACKGROUND
most infectious agents enter the body through mucosal surfaces such as the intestine or airways.
protective immune responses induced by such infections involve both cellular immune responses and systemic igg, but at mucosal surfaces secretory iga provides the most effective protection.
studies have indicated that iga responses are dependent on immune responses in mucosal lymphoid tissues such as intestinal peyer's patches and nasal associated lymphoid tissues  or tonsils  <cit> , where epithelial m cells acquire and transport antigens to underlying lymphoid tissue.
unfortunately, conventional vaccines rely instead on injected antigens, which induce igg but not iga.
live attenuated virus vaccines such as cold-adapted influenza , or oral polio vaccine can provide better mucosal immunity, but these are a greater challenge to develop, and they require an expensive cold chain that complicates delivery in developing countries.
vaccination at mucosal surfaces is a strategy that can help overcome the limitations of injected vaccines , but also to provide the benefit of mucosal iga responses.
progress with this strategy has been made in animal studies using two distinct approaches that could be described as bioengineering versus immunological.
in typical bioengineering approaches, vaccine antigens are encapsulated in polymer nanoparticles to package and protect the antigen ; the particles are administered in an aerosol suspension for inhalation, or as a liquid suspension for intranasal instillation.
here, it is assumed that m cells will non-specifically acquire the encapsulated antigens from the lumen and initiate mucosal immune responses.
however, antigen can also be acquired by dendritic cells in the mucosal epithelium  <cit>  and drain into other lymphoid tissues, so mucosal iga responses are not always efficiently induced.
in contrast to bioengineering strategies, immunological approaches are based on targeting antigen delivery to m cells for specific uptake; direct targeting should provide greater control over the induced immune response than unregulated transport to draining lymph nodes.
in animal models, targeting to m cells has been successful in inducing mucosal iga responses.
m cell targeting was achieved using a variety of ligands, including lectins or antibodies specific to a fucose moiety presented at the surface of mouse  m cells  <cit> , rgd peptides to bind exposed integrins  <cit> , and a reovirus sigma protein specific for jam-a  <cit> .
challenges still remain, such as the identification of m cell target receptors that will reliably work in humans, and the identification of an effective mucosal adjuvant.
indeed, in the absence of an effective adjuvant, m cell targeting in mice has been found to be very effective in inducing immunological tolerance instead of immunity  <cit> .
we previously identified the tight junction protein claudin  <dig> as a candidate m cell endocytosis receptor  <cit> .
though claudin  <dig> is normally found in tight junctions, it was also found redistributed into the cytoplasm of mouse and human m cells and appears to be part of the particle endocytosis machinery.
to test the potential of claudin  <dig> targeting, we developed a peptide derived from the c-terminal domain of the clostridium perfringens enterotoxin , which binds to the second external domain of claudin  <dig>  <cit> .
using fluorescently labeled microparticles and polymer nanoparticles displaying cpe or fusion proteins with cpe, we demonstrated that the cpe peptide retains claudin  <dig> binding  <cit>  and mediates enhanced uptake by m cells in vivo  <cit> .
in addition, cd <dig> mutant mice that lack m cell function failed to take up claudin 4-targeted particles, confirming the m cell-dependent uptake  <cit> .
thus, using the cpe peptide, m cell targeting of mucosal vaccines might be possible in humans.
in the present study, we tested the mucosal immune response to engineered vaccine fusion proteins incorporating antigen and the cpe m cell targeting peptide.
we report here that with an intranasal administration protocol, m cell targeted fusion proteins are effective in enhancing secretory iga responses along with a systemic serum th2-skewed igg response.
methods
recombinant antigens
soluble ha  <cit>  and fusions with fibritin  <cit> , a c-terminal flagellin and/or cpe <dig> were designed as his-tagged proteins, and were produced using a baculovirus expression kit  in which cloned dna was transfected into insect sf <dig> or sf <dig> cells grown in hyclone sfx-insect media .
the insect cells that secrete the protein were then grown at controlled 27°c and the supernatant harvested after incubation.
the insect culture media was filtered before purification.
western blot  was used to verify protein expression and quality before precipitating the media with 80% saturated ammonium sulfate .
after  <dig> hours of precipitation at 4°c, protein was centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> minutes to obtain a pellet for processing.
the resuspended protein was dialyzed overnight in a pbs 1x solution before binding to hispur resin  for  <dig> hours.
after washing, the protein was then eluted from resin using increased concentrations of imidazole.
resulting elutant was then dialyzed again in a solution of  <dig> x pbs/ <dig> mm hepes ph  <dig>  containing  <dig> % tween- <dig>  before concentrating down to a desired level.
final western blots and coomassie  stained gels were run on each protein to insure quality while concentration was measured using a spectrophotometer and bsa standards.
for studies on protein-peptide conjugates, cpe <dig> peptide was conjugated to ha antigen using a cpe <dig> peptide synthesized with a c-terminal ggggsggggs linker.
this peptide was then chemically linked to ha at a 10: <dig> peptide:ha protein ratio, using edc/sulfo-nhs  activated peptides to link to available amine groups on the ha protein.
immunization
balb/c mice were maintained under specific pathogen free colony conditions at the uc riverside vivarium.
all procedures were performed in accordance with institutional and nih guidelines.
immunization was performed by instillation of vaccine protein solutions intranasally into anesthetized mice.
a volume of  <dig> microliters was instilled into each nostril .
serum titers were assayed from peripheral blood collected by retro-orbital puncture at the time points indicated.
for fecal antibody analysis, dry fecal pellets were weighed, and extracted in a proportionate amount of extraction buffer .
after incubation and centrifugation,  <dig> microliters of supernatant was mixed with  <dig> microliters glycerol/ <dig> mm pmsf for storage.
broncho-alveolar lavage was taken by flushing lungs with  <dig>  ml pbs.
in all experimental groups, five mice were used per group.
mice were humanely killed under anesthesia at the conclusion of the experiment.
elisa
black flat-bottom plates  were coated with recombinant ha or synthetic cpe peptide prepared as described at  <dig> ug/ml in coating buffer .
plates were washed 3x in 1x tbst .
using a biotek elx <dig> automated plate washer.
plates were blocked with 3% normal goat serum in 1x pbs, then washed as before.
samples were diluted in blocking buffer, , then serially two-fold, and added to the coated and blocked plate in triplicate.
after washing, detection was performed with either rat anti-mouse iga-ap , goat anti-mouse igg-ap , diluted 1: <dig> and 1: <dig>  respectively, in 1x tbst.
for igg isotype analysis, detection was performed using goat anti-mouse igg1-ap  or goat anti-mouse igg2a-ap , diluted 1: <dig>  in 1x tbst.
for final development,  <dig> mm 4-mup  in dmso diluted 1: <dig> in substrate buffer  was added.
fluorescence was detected  <dig> minutes later at ex 360/em  <dig> on molecular devices spectramax m2e plate reader.
statistical analysis
except when noted, elisa fluorescence values were shown after background signal  was subtracted.
as noted in the text, analysis of the elisa titers was performed by taking fluorescence values in the linear range of the titration curve.
statistical comparisons  were performed using a one-tailed mann-whitney test , on the rationale that a non-parametric test would best measure the consistent effect of the specific vaccine formulations , though similar results were obtained using a t-test.
RESULTS
vaccination with cpe conjugated to ha
to test the ability of cpe-mediated m cell targeting to induce mucosal immunity, we chemically conjugated the claudin 4-targeting cpe peptide to recombinant influenza hemagglutinin , and delivered this antigen intranasally along with cholera toxin in the first dose as an adjuvant.
the conjugation of the peptide was accomplished by synthesizing the cpe peptide with a c-terminal linker peptide, and then conjugating this to the ha protein with amide linkages to available lysines.
at the conjugation ratio used in this study, there were approximately ten cpe peptides conjugated per trimeric ha complex .
we used a three dose protocol with  <dig> microgram cholera holotoxin in the first dose as an adjuvant, and  <dig> micrograms antigen per dose .
the response to a lower dose  was very low , while the response to the high dose was robust, so it is likely that the chemical conjugation had detrimental effects on the antigenicity of the recombinant ha protein.
ha-cpe fusion protein vaccine
to simplify the production of the vaccine antigen, we developed expression constructs in which the cpe peptide is linked at the c-terminal end of a recombinant fusion protein.
since the influenza hemagglutinin is normally present on the virus particle as a trimer, we included a trimerization peptide from fibritin  <cit>  to stabilize the ha trimer.
to separate the functional domains, a peptide linker sequence  was included.
the final protein  therefore had the structure:  - linker -  - linker -  - linker - .
for simplicity, this protein will be referred to as ha-cpe, while the control lacking the cpe peptide domain will be referred to as ha.
figure 2b shows non-denaturing coomassie gel of the purified protein, and blots showing that the purified protein had intact his tag  and ha determinants, both detectable by western blot.
in these non-denaturing gels the molecular weight markers are not as reliable, but the trimeric complex was still clearly evident as a band at a higher molecular weight.
the control ha antigen used was the same except for the absence of the c-terminal linker and cpe domain.
in this experiment , a four dose protocol was used;  <dig> micrograms of the recombinant antigen was given intranasally, with  <dig> microgram cholera holotoxin in the first dose.
three boosters with antigen alone followed, given in weekly intervals.
one week after the last dose, samples were collected from serum lung lavage, and fecal pellets.
in this experiment , the two groups of animals produced similar levels of igg anti-ha responses in serum, but the targeted ha-cpe antigen induced a significantly higher iga response in both serum and fecal pellets.
the bal showed similar responses to both antigens though the mean response to targeted vaccine was higher.
thus, with similar recombinant protein antigens, the presence of the m cell targeting peptide cpe induced stronger iga responses in both serum and the mucosal tissues.
despite the enhanced iga response to ha, we were unable to detect any antibody response to the cpe peptide, when tested against synthetic cpe peptide bound directly to elisa plates .
persistence of mucosal iga response
to assess the persistence of mucosal iga responses using this vaccine in a four week protocol, mice were tested at  <dig> weeks after the first dose  then tested a second time,  <dig> weeks after the initial dose .
in both groups, significant responses to ha were detected at the  <dig> week time point.
the increased serum iga response to targeted antigen seen at  <dig> weeks after the first dose  was less evident at  <dig> weeks , but an increased bal iga response was present at the  <dig> week time point.
thus, a persistent mucosal response to intranasal immunization was detected after  <dig> weeks, with some enhancement induced by the targeted vaccination.
similar results were found when a weekly three dose protocol  was assessed for evidence for enhanced mucosal responses.
in this case serum iga was not significantly enhanced at the early time point  and the targeted vaccine showed the best mucosal response above background.
the enhanced mucosal response showed persistence through the  <dig> week time point .
fecal responses were not significantly higher in the group given the targeted vaccine at the  <dig> week time point , but as with the four dose protocol, lung bronchoalveolar lavage did show slightly enhanced responses in the group given the targeted vaccine .
notably, as with the short term studies, the  <dig> week serum igg responses were similarly strong in all groups, whether given non-targeted or targeted vaccine, or whether using a three dose or four dose protocol.
mucosal administration and ig isotypes
while targeted vaccine showed enhanced mucosal iga responses, mucosal administration of non-targeted vaccine also induced some, albeit lower, mucosal iga responses.
by contrast, the serum igg response to ha was generally equivalent whether targeted or not.
thus, intranasal administration and m cell targeting both contributed more to the induction of the enhanced mucosal iga rather than to the systemic igg response.
to confirm that the administration route rather than the antigen itself was most important to iga induction, we compared intranasal immunization with a conventional subcutaneous immunization given as a mixture with alum .
mice were given three weekly intranasal doses of  <dig> microgram ha-cpe with cholera holotoxin adjuvant in the first dose, or a single subcutaneous injection of  <dig> micrograms ha in alum.
on the fourth week, both groups of mice showed similar serum igg responses .
however, in mucosal tissues such as bal, significant iga anti-ha responses were present in mice given intranasal ha-cpe, while the ha/alum immunized mice had nearly undetectable iga responses.
consistent with clinical responses to injected influenza vaccines, some mice did have low but detectable igg responses in bal .
the regulation of b cell isotype switching is determined by a combination of tissue specific factors   <cit> .
in the case of t cell dependent antibody responses, cytokines supporting iga responses are predominantly associated with th <dig> cells, also associated with a stronger igg <dig> isotype response compared to an igg2a isotype  <cit> .
in confirmation of this th <dig> dominance in the response to mucosal immunization, we found that the anti-ha titers in the serum showed an igg <dig> dominance over igg2a, estimated to be at least 10: <dig> .
this th <dig> dominance may be a direct consequence of the mucosal immunization route  <cit> , or the use of cholera toxin as the adjuvant  <cit> .
despite a similar th <dig> dominance induced by alum adjuvant , it clearly was not dependent on association mucosal iga responses .
moreover, the igg titers were similar, though the antigen dose administered by the subcutaneous route  was much higher than the total dose given by the intranasal route .
while it is also possible that the ha antigen is also predisposed toward th <dig> responses, other forms of ha can induce th1/igg2a responses in mice  <cit> .
discussion
the studies presented here extend our studies on m cell particle uptake showing that the claudin  <dig> targeting cpe peptide can effectively mediate m cell uptake in both the nalt and intestinal peyer's patches.
in these studies, the enhanced uptake mediated specific enhancement of mucosal iga responses, though the enhancement was not uniformly robust.
similar mouse m cell targeting of soluble proteins have been reported by others, both for inducing t and b cell immune responses including induction of secretory iga  <cit>  and for induction of mucosal tolerance  <cit> .
a recent study successfully used the much larger toxin subunit c-cpe for mucosal vaccination  <cit> , though in that study the authors expected the effect to depend on the c-cpe gaining entry past epithelial tight junctions.
by contrast, our studies showed that our shorter cpe peptides do not disrupt epithelial tight junctions in vivo, and instead mediate uptake through m cells  <cit> .
this approach using short cpe peptides is an advance over other strategies, as the targeting ligand has no risk of disrupting mucosal epithelium, and it can be used in humans .
while the short targeting peptide has only moderate affinity for the target receptor it does not appear to induce blocking antibodies, so it should be useful in multiple dosing strategies or for multiple vaccines.
our previous studies showed uptake of nanoparticles by m cells, but the present studies show that this can also be applied to the delivery of proteins in a physiological solution.
interestingly, m cell targeting by cpe had little enhancing influence on serum igg responses, suggesting that it may be more important in focusing antigen to mucosal lymphoid tissues for iga induction rather than affecting the overall efficiency of antigen delivery.
since iga isotype switching is thought to be mainly dependent on mucosal lymphoid tissues such as peyer's patch, isolated lymphoid follicles, and nalt, the utility of m cell targeting in mucosal vaccination may be specific to settings where secretory iga is more desirable as the best form of protective immunity.
in addition to local protection of mucosal epithelium from invasive microbes, targeted immunization for iga responses can provide secondary benefits for mothers immunized against mucosal pathogens; iga in the milk can help protect nursing infants  <cit> .
finally, mucosal vaccination in general also has clear value for its ease of administration, and efficiency in inducing persistent mucosal and systemic igg responses on a per-dose basis.
CONCLUSIONS
the present results extend our previous findings that a claudin  <dig> targeting peptide can mediate enhance mucosal m cell uptake.
here, we found that fusion proteins incorporating both a vaccine antigen and a short claudin 4-binding peptide can enhance mucosal iga responses to intranasal administration.
in addition, the intranasal route of vaccine administration appeared to be more efficient on a per-dose basis in inducing systemic igg responses as compared to subcutaneous administration.
thus, mucosal vaccination strategies relying on targeting ligands such as the cpe peptide specific for known human m cell targets should have promise in clinical applications.

interestingly, m cell targeting by cpe had little enhancing influence on serum igg responses, suggesting that it may be more important in focusing antigen to mucosal lymphoid tissues for iga induction rather than affecting the overall efficiency of antigen delivery. since iga isotype switching is thought to be mainly dependent on mucosal lymphoid tissues such as peyer's patch, isolated lymphoid follicles, and nalt, the utility of m cell targeting in mucosal vaccination may be specific to settings where secretory iga is more desirable as the best form of protective immunity. in addition to local protection of mucosal epithelium from invasive microbes, targeted immunization for iga responses can provide secondary benefits for mothers immunized against mucosal pathogens; iga in the milk can help protect nursing infants  <cit> . finally, mucosal vaccination in general also has clear value for its ease of administration, and efficiency in inducing persistent mucosal and systemic igg responses on a per-dose basis.

CONCLUSIONS
the present results extend our previous findings that a claudin  <dig> targeting peptide can mediate enhance mucosal m cell uptake. here, we found that fusion proteins incorporating both a vaccine antigen and a short claudin 4-binding peptide can enhance mucosal iga responses to intranasal administration. in addition, the intranasal route of vaccine administration appeared to be more efficient on a per-dose basis in inducing systemic igg responses as compared to subcutaneous administration. thus, mucosal vaccination strategies relying on targeting ligands such as the cpe peptide specific for known human m cell targets should have promise in clinical applications.

"BACKGROUND
the western ghats of india and highlands of sri lanka are a global biodiversity hotspot, i.e.
they contain several endemic animal and plant species which are recognised as being distinct at a high taxonomic level  <cit> .
endemism is particularly marked among amphibians, with over 75% of subcontinent species restricted to this region alone  <cit> .
explaining biogeographic patterns has mainly focussed on the geological history of the subcontinent, which indicates prolonged periods of isolation from the late cretaceous to the early tertiary  <cit> .
before joining the eurasian mainland, india was part of gondwana  and gradually became detached from other landmasses during its northward journey across the tethys sea  <cit> .
although the actual isolation of india has been debated , molecular studies have demonstrated the presence of ancient lineages in india, and these are interpreted as evidence of this geological history  <cit> .
the subsequent accretion of the indian plate into eurasia during the early tertiary  <cit>  was a potential catalyst for biotic exchange between the subcontinent and the eurasian mainland.
it has been shown that an out-of-india dispersal of gondwanan elements into eurasia resulted in the wider distribution of previously isolated groups  <cit> .
however, less attention has been given to the opportunity of ""into-india"" movement of laurasian species after the establishment of this new geological connection.
the exchange of species between the indian subcontinent and eurasia must have been affected by the geomorphological changes generated after their collision.
the uplift of the himalayas and the tibetan plateau not only created physical barriers for dispersal, but also heavily influenced the prevalent climate  <cit> .
the climatic regime in asia changed from a zonal-pattern to a monsoon-dominant system, a reorganization that had major consequences for asian and indian terrestrial ecosystems  <cit> .
true toads  are a family of anurans with a wide distribution, comprising over  <dig> species  <cit> .
their present-day natural absence on several landmasses of gondwanan origin , their nested position within nobleobatrachia , and their recent origin  <cit> , imply that they reached the indian subcontinent only after the indo-asia collision.
toads thus constitute an ideal group for studying tertiary into-india dispersal.
despite numerous studies on phylogenetic relationships in bufonidae  <cit> , species from the indian subcontinent were always underrepresented and their phylogenetic relationships remain largely elusive.
in addition to multiple species whose taxonomic affiliations are uncertain , toads on the indian subcontinent are classified in five genera: bufoides  and adenomus  are considered endemic to the subcontinent, duttaphrynus has a wide distribution, and torrentially adapted ansonia and arboreal pedostibes species show disjunct distributions in wet-zone areas of south-east asia and india  <cit> .
current taxonomy therefore suggests multiple dispersal events between the indian subcontinent and adjacent regions.
here we analysed a combined set of mitochondrial and nuclear gene fragments to investigate phylogenetic relationships and biogeography of indian bufonidae.
our sampling includes  <dig> toads from the subcontinent and a representative diversity of species of adjacent regions, with particular attention to shared genera ansonia, pedostibes and duttaphrynus.
we performed dating estimates and biogeographic analyses to investigate biotic exchange between the indian subcontinent and adjacent regions, and evaluated how this affected endemism in the western ghats-sri lanka biodiversity hotspot.
RESULTS
phylogenetic relationships of bufonidae
our data matrix consists of  <dig> basepairs ,  <dig> bp of which could be unambiguously aligned.
maximum parsimony  analyses of the total dataset produced  <dig> equally parsimonious trees of  <dig> steps.
maximum likelihood  analyses of the total dataset produced a single ml tree , which is very similar to the bayesian consensus phylogram .
our analyses confidently determine the phylogenetic position of ten known species currently treated as incertae sedis ""bufo"" in figure 1).
in agreement with previous evidence  <cit> , we recover with high support the northern african ""bufo"" mauritanicus as sister species of a sub-saharan amietophrynus clade .
based on this support, we suggest transferring the species ""bufo"" mauritanicus schlegel,  <dig> to the genus amietophrynus.
the remaining ""bufo"" species in our study are nested in, or closely related to the genus duttaphrynus as originally defined .
the bufo scaber group  <cit> , here represented by ""bufo"" scaber and ""bufo"" atukoralei, is nested in duttaphrynus.
to restore monophyly of duttaphrynus and to place sampled ""bufo"" species in a taxonomic framework, we suggest expanding duttaphrynus to include the most recent common ancestor of bufo melanostictus  and bufo stomaticus lütken,  <dig>  and all of its descendants.
eight known species, including those belonging to the bufo stomaticus group sensu  <cit>  , are thus transferred to this genus .
Δ ln l is the difference of likelihood between the ml tree and the best tree compatible with the constraint indicated under ""phylogenetic hypothesis""
in contrast to previous studies, we recover with high support the old world toads as a clade nested among new world taxa , but the sequence of early diversification of its major lineages remains poorly resolved.
furthermore, our analyses differ from previous hypotheses in a number of important aspects: first, the african species schismaderma carens, in contrast to other studies  <cit> , is recovered as sister species of a strongly supported churamiti-nectophrynoides clade.
however, support for this african clade as a whole remains moderate.
second, in agreement with a previous study  <cit> , our analyses do not support the monophyly of pseudepidalea but find an ambiguous phylogenetic position for pseudepidalea brongersmai .
third, the genus pedostibes is not recovered as being monophyletic :p. hosii does not group with the type species p. tuberculosus, but comes out as the sister species of phrynoidis juxtaspera .
fourth, species of the genus ansonia similarly do not form a clade .
instead, south-east asian species group with pelophryne .
a previously unrecognized adaptive radiation of toads
our analyses reveal a previously unrecognized adaptive radiation of toads, containing torrential,  arboreal, and drought-adapted ecomorphs in adult and/or larval forms .
the name adenominae cope  <dig> is available to denote this clade in a phylogenetic or linnaean system  <cit> .
the malabar torrent toad ""ansonia"" ornata from the western ghats is the sister lineage of all other genera in this radiation .
courtship, mating, egg-laying and tadpole development of this species all happens in and around torrential habitats.
it also exhibits morphological characters that reflect its torrential ecology .
furthermore tadpoles of this species possess a specialized suctorial disk, allowing them to cling on rocks in fast flowing water .
although both larvae and adults of the disjunctly distributed south-east asian ansonia species look remarkably similar  <cit> , they form the sister clade of the asian genus pelophryne, species that show terrestrial adaptations .
the creation of a new genus will be necessary to accommodate the indian species ansonia ornata günther,  <dig> .
another interesting member of this toad radiation is the malabar tree toad pedostibes tuberculosus, a western ghats endemic species that is largely arboreal  <cit> : during the night, males attract the females by calling from tree holes or an elevated position on leaves of vegetation.
furthermore, the fingers and toes of this species are dilated in broad truncated disks, which is a clear adaptation to their arboreal lifestyle.
our analyses indicate that pedostibes from the indian subcontinent and the malayan peninsula independently evolved toe pads and an arboreal ecology  <cit> .
pedostibes tuberculosus also has a specialized development: it lays about  <dig> eggs in a clutch  at the edge of streams, in which the bottom-feeding tadpoles further develop .
various ecomorphs are also evident in the genus adenomus, which are slender toads endemic to the highlands of sri lanka   <cit> .
the three members, one of which  is considered extinct, inhabit streams in tropical montane forests or are semi-arboreal  <cit> .
the radiation also includes a western ghats endemic lineage containing ""bufo"" koynayensis, a species formerly placed in its own species group because its morphology did not correspond with any other recognized oriental group  <cit> .
this species often inhabits rocky mountain streams and has a bright yellow coloration during the mating season.
interestingly, it also lays its eggs in clutches .
because of these reasons, we suggest transferring ""bufo"" koynayensis and its undescribed sister species to a new genus .
finally, the radiation includes a clade of pond-breeding species with a warty skin and more ""typical"" toad morphology.
this group contains toads that were formerly placed in the bufo melanostictus, bufo stomaticus, bufo scaber or bufo arabicus groups.
together, they have a broad distribution, covering india, south-east asia, the arabian peninsula, and possibly northeast africa.
dating estimates
our dating estimates are listed in table  <dig> and  <dig>  analyses using ingroup + outgroup calibrations  and ingroup calibrations alone  resulted in highly similar node ages.
additionally, removal of individual time constraints resulted in congruent dating estimates .
all analyses place the crown origin of bufonidae around the paleocene-eocene border ; analysis b:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya, table 2).
this divergence time estimate is consistent with previous amphibian studies that cover a variety of methods and taxon sampling  <cit> .
our analyses further indicate that bufonids reached the old world around  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya .
the origin of specialized endemic lineages  on the indian subcontinent is estimated between  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya .
mean ± standard deviation  and 95% credibility intervals  are shown for two sets of calibration points used in this study
ancestral areas were reconstructed by both diva and mp analyses.
dating estimates of two sets of calibration points are shown .
abbreviations are: s, south-east asia; w, western ghats and sri lankan highlands; i, remaining indian subcontinent; a, arabian peninsula.
nodes are cross-referenced in figure 2
our time estimates for the origin of bufonids differ substantially from a recent study where this event was placed in the late cretaceous   <cit> .
this older dating estimate can be attributed to the use of the oldest ""leptodactylid"" fossil baurubatrachus pricei†  to calibrate the crown node of nobleobatrachia.
this is possibly an overestimation: the identification of baurubatrachus as a leptodactylid is questionable given the lack of synapomorphies defining this family  <cit>  and its polyphyly according to molecular studies .
for example, calyptocephalella gayi was originally assigned to leptodactylidae, but recent molecular studies have shown a close relationship to australian myobatrachidae.
therefore, calibrating the most recent common ancestor of all ""leptodactylidae"", including calyptocephalella gayi and nobleobatrachia, at  <dig> myr would have been a more conservative approach and would likely have given results similar to our dating estimates.
biogeography
our trees show a deeply nested clade of old world bufonids, indicating a single dispersal event .
this result is in contrast with a previous hypothesis suggesting that one toad lineage returned to the new world  <cit> .
bayesian dating estimates suggest that bufonids reached the old world around the late oligocene, a period that has been associated with global climate warming  <cit> .
we hypothesize that this allowed toads to access northern latitudes and subsequently reach eurasia.
although trans-oceanic dispersal cannot be excluded, colonization is more likely to have occurred over the trans-beringian land bridge, which connected eurasia and north america intermittently from the mid-cretaceous until the late pliocene  <cit> .
after arrival in eurasia, they rapidly spread southwards, reaching africa, south-east asia and the indian subcontinent around the oligocene-miocene transition.
the early diversification of toads on the indian subcontinent led to the origin of specialized endemic lineages  in the early miocene .
dispersal-vicariance  analyses  indicate that this radiation occurred on the southern parts of the subcontinent, as the oldest lineages are currently restricted to the western ghats and sri lankan highlands.
the timing of this radiation corresponds with a period that is marked by global climatic- and environmental changes  <cit> .
these were probably caused by the combined effect of tibetan uplift and retreat of the paratethys epicontinental sea, both of which were initiated by the indo-asia collision  <cit> .
on the indian subcontinent, the transition from a zonal to a monsoon-dominated climate pattern may have led to the aridification of the remaining peninsula, and a significant shift from closed forested tropical ecosystems towards more open savannah-like ecosystems  <cit> .
if correct, specialized frogs distributed in the western ghats-sri lanka biodiversity hotspot would have become isolated from similar mountainous rainforest habitats.
this would also explain why other rainforest clades radiated and largely remained in the highlands of sri lanka, even when sea-level variations frequently permitted dispersal to the mainland  <cit> .
our ancestral area reconstruction and dating estimates  indicate that around the middle miocene, toads successfully dispersed out of the western ghats-sri lanka hotspot and colonized other parts of the subcontinent, south-east asia, and the arabian peninsula.
it is possible that dispersal of these toads was more frequent, but more extensive taxon sampling is required to address this question.
CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the late oligocene-middle miocene interval was an important period for the diversification of specialized endemic lineages on the indian subcontinent.
it is likely that this period was not only essential for bufonid diversification, but also led to isolation of newly arrived lineages in other taxa of laurasian origin.
if confirmed, the indian subcontinent's higher taxonomic endemism not only originated from cretaceous isolation, but also from into india dispersal and subsequent radiation of new elements after accretion to the eurasian mainland.

subsequent out of – and into india dispersal of species after accretion to the eurasian mainland is therefore often seen as a biogeographic factor that 'diluted' the composition of previously isolated indian biota.
consequently, higher taxonomic level endemism on the indian subcontinent is not only the result of cretaceous isolation, but also of invasion, isolation and radiation of new elements after accretion to the eurasian mainland.
contrary to previous studies, old world toads were recovered as a nested clade within new world bufonidae, indicating a single colonization event.
using c.  <dig> base pairs of mitochondrial and nuclear dna, we investigated the evolutionary history and biogeography of true toads , a group that colonized the indian subcontinent after the indo-asia collision.
molecular dating estimates and biogeographic analyses indicate that the early diversification of this clade happened in the western ghats and sri lanka during the late oligocene to early miocene.
however, few molecular studies have focussed on into-india dispersal as a possible source of endemism on the subcontinent.
after arrival in the western ghats-sri lanka hotspot, toads diversified in situ, with only one lineage able to successfully disperse out of these mountains.
species currently classified as ansonia and pedostibes were both recovered as being non-monophyletic, providing evidence for the independent origin of torrential and arboreal ecomorphs on the indian subcontinent and in south-east asia.
our analyses also revealed a previously unrecognized adaptive radiation of toads containing a variety of larval and adult ecomorphs.

contrary to previous studies, old world toads were recovered as a nested clade within new world bufonidae, indicating a single colonization event. species currently classified as ansonia and pedostibes were both recovered as being non-monophyletic, providing evidence for the independent origin of torrential and arboreal ecomorphs on the indian subcontinent and in south-east asia. our analyses also revealed a previously unrecognized adaptive radiation of toads containing a variety of larval and adult ecomorphs. molecular dating estimates and biogeographic analyses indicate that the early diversification of this clade happened in the western ghats and sri lanka during the late oligocene to early miocene.


CONCLUSIONS
paleoclimate reconstructions have shown that the early neogene of india was marked by major environmental changes, with the transition from a zonal- to the current monsoon-dominated climate. after arrival in the western ghats-sri lanka hotspot, toads diversified in situ, with only one lineage able to successfully disperse out of these mountains. consequently, higher taxonomic level endemism on the indian subcontinent is not only the result of cretaceous isolation, but also of invasion, isolation and radiation of new elements after accretion to the eurasian mainland.

"BACKGROUND
many traditional fermented dairy products, such as airag and tarag  <cit> , are regarded as nutraceutics and have been the major components in a typical diet for the mongol ethnic residing in mongolia, kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan, and some central asian regions of russia since ancient times.
these traditional fermented foods remain popular until now.
in this study, naturally fermented cow’s milk  samples were collected from mongol-ethnic families of kalmyk in the republic of kalmykia and buryats in chita that retain the mongolian traditional life style and dietary habit.
nfcm in these families is a common home-made dairy product, which is a white to yellowish-white liquid fermented from milk with or without specific cultures.
nfcm are traditionally made by adding old fermented milk containing the natural starter cultures, thus these products are free from commercial starter cultures and own unique and stable microbial communities.
apart from their role as the nfcm-associated microbial community as a whole, some specific strains isolated from nfcm may have added value as producers of antimicrobial compounds  <cit>  or as probiotics  <cit> .
although the nutritional value of nfcm is well-known, their microbiota composition has not been fully described.
therefore, it is of interest to further characterize the microbial diversity of nfcm.
the microbial biodiversity of fermented dairy products has been assessed by culture-dependent methods to identify the indigenous bacterial composition.
a wide variety of firmicutes genera, such as lactobacillus, lactococcus, streptococcus, leuconoctoc, which are known to influence the flavor and maturation of fermented food  <cit> , have been identified.
some of them have also been isolated from different naturally fermented dairy products  <cit> , including cheese  <cit> , tarag  <cit> , kurut  <cit> , and kefir  <cit> .
relatively low levels of bifidobacteriaceae, moraxellaceae , corynebacterium, halomonas, pediococcus, micrococcus and staphylococcus have been reported as compared with the total bacterial population in fermented dairy products  <cit> .
in order to assess the microbial diversity of fermented dairy products, various culture-independent molecular biology-based techniques have been widely applied, such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis   <cit> , temporal temperature gel electrophoresis   <cit> , quantitative real-time pcr   <cit>  and sanger sequencing of 16s rrna gene clone library  <cit> .
these culture-independent techniques are valuable tools to monitor the microbial structure and dynamics in naturally fermented dairy products.
they are not only able to reveal the dominant members present in the samples, but also uncover the rarer bacterial species  <cit> .
pyrosequencing is an automated high-throughput sequencing technique introduced by margulies et al  <cit> .
this method is based on the synthesis of single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid and the detection of the light generated by pyrophosphate released during nucleotide incorporation.
this technique is able to analyze the microbial structure, gene content, and hence reveal the microbial-based metabolic potential in an ecosystem through the rapid and accurate sequencing of nucleotide sequences.
pyrosequencing has successfully been used to detect the diversity and dynamics of the bacterial populations in various fermented foods, such as cheese  <cit> , kefir  <cit> , fermented seafood  <cit>  and fermented soybean  <cit> .
in this study, the microbial populations in nfcm were investigated.
nineteen nfcm samples from the russian republics of kalmykia and chita were evaluated by ribosomal gene targeted 454-pyrosequencing.
however, almost all the previous papers focused on the microbial composition of the mongolian traditional fermented dairy products analyzed samples prepared by the nomads of the mongolian region of china and mongolia  <cit>  but not those made in the mongolian region of russia.
results of this study do not only provide accurate and detailed information on the microbiota diversity of nfcm, but also fill the gap of the study of the traditional mongolian fermented dairy products.
RESULTS
bacterial and fungal sequence abundance and diversity
a total of  <dig>  of bacterial v1-v <dig> 16s rrna raw sequence reads were generated from the nineteen nfcm samples, with an average of  <dig>  sequences read for each sample.
meanwhile,  <dig>  of 18s rrna raw sequence reads were generated for the fungal community.
through pynast alignment and 100% sequence identity clustering, the unique representative sequence reads were delimited for further analysis, which corresponded to  <dig>  bacterial and  <dig>  fungal sequences.
the number of unique and classifiable representative otu sequences for bacteria and fungi were, respectively,  <dig>  and  <dig>  .
based on homologous sequence alignment method and clustering with information extracted from the rdp and blast databases, the lowest level of taxonomy of the identified otus was determined.
<dig> % of bacterial and 39% of fungal sequences could not be assigned to the genus level.
the shannon diversity curves but not rarefaction curves for all samples reached the saturation phase , suggesting that although additional new phylotypes would possibly be identified by increasing the sequencing depth, the majority of bacterial and fungal phylotypes for the samples had already been captured in the current analysis.
the shannon index, simpson diversity index, chao <dig> and observed species of each sample were used to evaluate the species richness and diversity .
mann-whitney test was applied to assess the richness and diversity of bacteria and fungi between kalmykia and chita samples.
since significant differences  were observed in all indicators of the bacterial community in the two sampling sites, it can be concluded that a large distinction of species richness and diversity of the bacterial community existed between the two groups of samples.
on the contrary, there were no statistically significant difference for any of the fungal indicators between samples from the two sampling sites , indicating that a high similarity of fungal diversity was shared between the two sample groups.table  <dig>

comparative analysis of bacterial composition in the nfcm of kalmykia and chita
seven bacterial phyla were identified in the nfcm sampled in this study , namely firmicutes, proteobacteria, actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, acidobacteria, chloroflexi and deinococcus-thermus.
the predominant phylum was firmicutes, accounting for  <dig> % of the total bacterial sequences.
this phylum contributed to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the bacterial sequence reads of the kalmykia and chita samples, respectively.
proteobacteria was the subdominant phylum, which contributed to  <dig> % of the total bacterial sequences.
minor phyla, including actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, acidobacteria, chloroflexi and deinococcus-thermus, together contributed to  <dig> % of the total bacterial sequences.
only the phylum acidobacteria, but not the other six phyla, showed a significant difference between the kalmykia and chita samples .figure  <dig>

the major bacterial genera in nfcm mainly belonged to the phyla, firmicutes  and proteobacteria  .
in addition, the percentages of sequence reads of  <dig> genera were different between the two sample groups.
lactobacillus contributed to more than 70% in most samples, except for f <dig>  f <dig>  els <dig>  e <dig>  d <dig>  f <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  and f <dig>  lactococcus was dominant in the samples, e <dig>  d <dig>  e <dig>  els <dig>  f <dig>  and f <dig>  contributing to more than 50% of total bacterial sequences .
however, considerable difference was noted between the bacterial compositions of the two groups.
six bacterial genera were found to be significantly differing between the kalmykia  and chita  samples .
the most abundant genus, lactobacillus, was comprised of  <dig> different types of otus .
based on the phylogenetic tree, some of these lactobacillus otus could be further assigned to different lactobacillus species.
for example, otu <dig> and otu <dig> clustered with l. helveticus and l. delbrueckii subsp.
bulgaricus respectively.
otu <dig> was closest to l. kefiranofaciens and l. kefiranofaciens subsp.
kefiranofaciens.
otu <dig> were nearest to l. pentosus and l. plantarum.
otu <dig> and otu <dig> affiliated to l. buchneri, meaning that they were likely to be the subspecies of l. buchneri.figure  <dig>

multivariate analysis of the bacterial communities of nfcm from kalmykia and chita
pcoa and manova were performed to analyze the bacterial communities and structure of the two sample groups .
pcoa based on the weighted   and the unweighted   unifrac distances revealed the existence of bacterial structural difference, as symbols representing the two groups were largely separated on the unweighted but not weighted pcoa score plot.
this result suggests that the difference lied not on the abundant otus.
even though there was overlapping of data points from the kalmykia and chita samples on both score plots, the results of manova based on both the weighted  and unweighted  unifrac distance confirmed that significant differences existed.figure  <dig>

red and blue symbols represent samples from kalmykia and chita, respectively.
to further identify the bacterial populations that accounted for the difference observed between the kalmykia and chita nfcm samples, rda was carried out .
in this case, nfcm samples in kalmykia and chita were the “nominal environmental variables”, and the relative abundances of all otus  were the response variables.
monte carlo permutation test  showed that the constrained ordination model was statistically significant  and the first canonical axis was able to explain  <dig> % of the variability of response variables .
moreover,  <dig> otus were identified as the key variables, which had good correlation with sample scores on the rda canonical axis .
among them,  <dig> otus  were enriched in the samples from chita, while the other  <dig> otus  were enriched in the kalmykia samples.figure  <dig>

blue arrows represent the response variables with the first ordination axis explaining respectively for at least  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the variability of the bacterial and fungal microbiota.
the p-values generated from the monte carlo permutation test are included in the plots.
fungal composition of the nfcm
the major fungal phyla found in the nfcm were ascomycota, basidiomycota and chytridiomycota, constituting  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the fungal population , respectively.
no fungal sequence read was detected in the samples, f <dig> and d <dig>  which may due to an intrinsic low abundance of fungi present in these samples.
at the genus level,  <dig> fungal genera were identified, among which six genera were highly variable between samples, namely, pichia, galactomyces, vanderwaltozyma, wickerhamomyces, saccharomyces, and cordyceps  .
among them, pichia, galactomyces and vanderwaltozyma were the dominant fungal genera  across all samples.
pichia contributed to more than 50% in most samples, except for the samples, els <dig>  f <dig>  e <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  e <dig>  f <dig>  and e <dig>  while galactomyces was prevalent in the samples, f <dig>  f <dig>  and f <dig>  contributing to more than 50% of total fungal sequences.
moreover, in the sample e <dig>  vanderwaltozyma contributed to 99% of total fungal sequences.
comparison of the fungal composition between the kalmykia and chita samples
the weighted and unweighted unifrac pcoa was performed to evaluate if any structural difference existed in the fungal community between the two sample groups .
although there was slight overlapping between the samples from the two groups on the score plots, data points were largely separated by both weighted   and unweighted   unifrac analysis.
however, a further manova test showed that only the unweighted  but not weighted  unifrac distance showed significant difference between sample groups.
these results suggest that the structural difference in the fungal community was attributed to the less abundant fungal lineages.
rda was applied to further identify the specific fungal groups that accounted for the difference observed between the kalmykia and chita nfcm samples .
mcpt showed that the constrained ordination model by kalmykia or chita was significant .
we identified  <dig> otus that fitted well by the sample scores on the canonical axis as key variables; each had at least  <dig> % of the variability in its values explained by this axis.
on the rda ordination plot,  <dig> otus were enriched in chita nfcm samples, and they belonged to the genera saccharomyces, pichia, vanderwaltozyma and unidentified trichocomaceae.
meanwhile,  <dig> otus were enriched in kalmykia nfcm samples, which mainly belonged to the genera vanderwaltozyma and galactomyces.
discussion
pyrosequencing analysis is able to provide a thorough description of microbiota community in environmental samples, which also helps to reveal their potential function.
in the current study, the bacterial and fungal communities of nfcm from kalmykia and chita were studied.
firmicutes, proteobacteria, bacteroidetes and actinobacteria were the dominant bacteria at phylum level, while the abundance of acidobacteria was considerably different between the two groups.
firmicutes was the most abundant phylum, which was in line with results from some previous studies performed in naturally fermented dairy products, such as kefir  <cit> , fermented seafood  <cit> , kochujang  <cit> , pearl millet slurries  <cit> , and artisanal cheeses  <cit> .
the fungal community was dominated with ascomycota, and this phylum was prevalent in korean alcoholic beverages  <cit>  and chinese liquors  <cit> .
as reflected by the shannon index and rarefaction analysis, the bacterial diversity and richness were higher than that of the fungi in the same environment, which is consistent with a previous report on tarag  <cit> .
the report found that the isolated number and density of lactic acid bacteria were considerably higher than that of yeasts in the studied traditional mongolian fermented dairy products.
lactobacillus and lactococcus were the dominant genera for samples from both kalmykia and chita.
these two genera are commonly associated with naturally fermented dairy products  <cit> .
lactobacillus was the predominant genus in our samples.
the starter cultures of the homemade nfcm in this study were passage from the old nfcm.
it was possible that the high proportion of lactobacillus was retained and even enriched during nfcm fermentation.
it has been reported that the acid tolerance of lactobacilli is higher than streptococcus and lactococcus  <cit> .
some species of lactococcus have low acid tolerance, however, they could be isolated from raw milk and were found growing during the early stage of fermentation  <cit> .
these may explain the lower abundance of lactococcus than lactobacillus as seen in our results.
some reports claim that 16s rrna is a slowly diverging molecule and it fails to reveal significant differences between recently diverged species; thus protein-encoding genes  may be used as the phylogenetic markers to ensure an accurate assignment of otus to the species or even subspecies level.
our results demonstrate a high resolution of pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene in assigning lactobacillus to the precision of species and subspecies levels.
based on phylogenetic grouping of lactobacillus otu representative sequences, l. helveticus and l. delbrueckii subsp.
bulgaricus were predominant in the nfcm.
a similar lactobacillus composition was reported in the traditional dairy products, airag and tarag  <cit> .
furthermore, the major genera , streptococcus, macrococcus, leuconostoc, enterococcus, acetobacter, citrobacter, acinetobacter, bacillus, kluyvera, enterobacter, were present in our nfcm samples.
among them, streptococcus, macrococcus, leuconostoc, and enterococcus have been reported as the subdominant genera in raw milk  <cit>  and cheese  <cit> , which aligned with the results of our study.
acinetobacter and enterobacter were detected in mexican alcoholic beverages.
it was speculated that these genera were originated from the bacterial contamination in raw milk; and they subsequently decreased during the fermentation process  <cit> .
pichia, galactomyces and vanderwaltozyma were the dominant fungal genera in nfcm.
pichia is commonly associated with fermentative metabolic processes of naturally fermented dairy products and cheese  <cit> , as this genus takes part in hydrolyzing milk protein and fat, assimilating lactic acid, and producing ethanol  <cit> .
galactomyces has been reported as the dominant yeasts in dairy products, which may involve in lactic acid utilization, proteolysis, lipolysis and flavour development  <cit> .
however, a previously published study reported a different makeup of fungal community in two types of traditional mongolian fermented products namely airag and tarag.
airag was dominated with the species kluyveromyces marxianus, while the prevalent species in tarag were saccharomyces cerevisiae, issatchenkia orientalis, and kazachstania unispora  <cit> .
our data revealed clear differences in the microbiota of nfcm collected in the two sampling locations.
however, at this point, the exact reasons for the observed variation in the microbiota have not been identified.
similar to our study, previous reports have found that the exposure of cheese to different external environments during the manufacturing process impacted the microbiota composition of the final products  <cit> .
the microbial communities of traditional fermented products, such as fermented milk  <cit>  and kochujiang  <cit> , varied with the sampling geographic or manufacturing region.
moreover, animals living at different altitudes, e.g.
yak in the tibetan region, may have different resistance to cold environment, leading to an unusual microbiota makeup of yak milk and its fermented products  <cit> .
kalmykia and chita are located  <dig>  kilometers apart in southern russia.
the nfcm collected from both sites were produced with the same manufacturing process.
however, the two places have dissimilar altitude and climate characteristics.
kalmykia is located at the east european plain, with averages of about  <dig> meters in elevation  <cit> .
it has a continental climate, with very hot and dry summers  and cold winters  with little snow .
on the contrary, chita is located at the central siberian plateau and the average elevation is about 500- <dig> meters  <cit> .
it is generally colder in chita than kalmykia with the average summer and winter temperatures ranged from +19°c and −16°c, respectively.
additionally, chita is comparatively humid than kalmykia with an average annual precipitation of up to  <dig> millimeters.
thus, we speculate that the factor of geographic environment including altitudes and climate play a more significant role over the manufacturing process in resulting in the different microbiota compositions of the analyzed products.
our unpublished results revealed a higher microbial richness in the mongolian style fermented products made by similar methods collected in russia as compared with those from mongolia and inner mongolia of china.
this further confirms that the variation in the microbiota structure of these fermented products may be regional-based.
some other crucial factors that may affect the fermented milk microbiota composition are the hygienic quality of the milk and the manufacturing process, as well as the back slopping technique.
these factors may together contribute to the selection of specific microbial groups and affect the ecological succession of the microbial communities during the fermentation process.
CONCLUSIONS
to sum up, the current study analyzed the bacterial and fungal community diversity of nfcm in kalmykia and chita.
our results showed that clear structural differences existed in the microbiota of nfcm from kalmykia and chita.
the current study has provided interesting insights into the relationship between the microbial composition of nfcm and their geographic regions.
the results have also shown that pyrosequencing technique is useful for detecting a wide diversity of microorganisms in nfcm.
the results obtained here will be valuable for screening for beneficial strains from traditional fermented dairy products, which are made by the mongolians residing in russia.
our study has also provided novel data for mongolian traditional fermented dairy products.
",222,"BACKGROUND
many traditional fermented dairy products, such as airag and tarag  <cit> , are regarded as nutraceutics and have been the major components in a typical diet for the mongol ethnic residing in mongolia, kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan, and some central asian regions of russia since ancient times. these traditional fermented foods remain popular until now. in this study, naturally fermented cow’s milk  samples were collected from mongol-ethnic families of kalmyk in the republic of kalmykia and buryats in chita that retain the mongolian traditional life style and dietary habit. nfcm in these families is a common home-made dairy product, which is a white to yellowish-white liquid fermented from milk with or without specific cultures. nfcm are traditionally made by adding old fermented milk containing the natural starter cultures, thus these products are free from commercial starter cultures and own unique and stable microbial communities. apart from their role as the nfcm-associated microbial community as a whole, some specific strains isolated from nfcm may have added value as producers of antimicrobial compounds  <cit>  or as probiotics  <cit> . although the nutritional value of nfcm is well-known, their microbiota composition has not been fully described. therefore, it is of interest to further characterize the microbial diversity of nfcm.

bacterial and fungal sequence abundance and diversity
a total of  <dig>  of bacterial v1-v <dig> 16s rrna raw sequence reads were generated from the nineteen nfcm samples, with an average of  <dig>  sequences read for each sample. meanwhile,  <dig>  of 18s rrna raw sequence reads were generated for the fungal community. through pynast alignment and 100% sequence identity clustering, the unique representative sequence reads were delimited for further analysis, which corresponded to  <dig>  bacterial and  <dig>  fungal sequences. the number of unique and classifiable representative otu sequences for bacteria and fungi were, respectively,  <dig>  and  <dig>  . based on homologous sequence alignment method and clustering with information extracted from the rdp and blast databases, the lowest level of taxonomy of the identified otus was determined.  <dig> % of bacterial and 39% of fungal sequences could not be assigned to the genus level.

the shannon diversity curves but not rarefaction curves for all samples reached the saturation phase , suggesting that although additional new phylotypes would possibly be identified by increasing the sequencing depth, the majority of bacterial and fungal phylotypes for the samples had already been captured in the current analysis.

the major bacterial genera in nfcm mainly belonged to the phyla, firmicutes  and proteobacteria  . in addition, the percentages of sequence reads of  <dig> genera were different between the two sample groups. lactobacillus contributed to more than 70% in most samples, except for f <dig>  f <dig>  els <dig>  e <dig>  d <dig>  f <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  and f <dig>  lactococcus was dominant in the samples, e <dig>  d <dig>  e <dig>  els <dig>  f <dig>  and f <dig>  contributing to more than 50% of total bacterial sequences . however, considerable difference was noted between the bacterial compositions of the two groups. six bacterial genera were found to be significantly differing between the kalmykia  and chita  samples .

the most abundant genus, lactobacillus, was comprised of  <dig> different types of otus . based on the phylogenetic tree, some of these lactobacillus otus could be further assigned to different lactobacillus species. for example, otu <dig> and otu <dig> clustered with l. helveticus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus respectively. otu <dig> was closest to l. kefiranofaciens and l. kefiranofaciens subsp. kefiranofaciens. otu <dig> were nearest to l. pentosus and l. plantarum. otu <dig> and otu <dig> affiliated to l. buchneri, meaning that they were likely to be the subspecies of l. buchneri.figure  <dig>

multivariate analysis of the bacterial communities of nfcm from kalmykia and chita
pcoa and manova were performed to analyze the bacterial communities and structure of the two sample groups . pcoa based on the weighted   and the unweighted   unifrac distances revealed the existence of bacterial structural difference, as symbols representing the two groups were largely separated on the unweighted but not weighted pcoa score plot. this result suggests that the difference lied not on the abundant otus. even though there was overlapping of data points from the kalmykia and chita samples on both score plots, the results of manova based on both the weighted  and unweighted  unifrac distance confirmed that significant differences existed.figure  <dig>

to further identify the bacterial populations that accounted for the difference observed between the kalmykia and chita nfcm samples, rda was carried out . in this case, nfcm samples in kalmykia and chita were the “nominal environmental variables”, and the relative abundances of all otus  were the response variables. monte carlo permutation test  showed that the constrained ordination model was statistically significant  and the first canonical axis was able to explain  <dig> % of the variability of response variables . moreover,  <dig> otus were identified as the key variables, which had good correlation with sample scores on the rda canonical axis . among them,  <dig> otus  were enriched in the samples from chita, while the other  <dig> otus  were enriched in the kalmykia samples.figure  <dig>

fungal composition of the nfcm
the major fungal phyla found in the nfcm were ascomycota, basidiomycota and chytridiomycota, constituting  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the fungal population , respectively. no fungal sequence read was detected in the samples, f <dig> and d <dig>  which may due to an intrinsic low abundance of fungi present in these samples. at the genus level,  <dig> fungal genera were identified, among which six genera were highly variable between samples, namely, pichia, galactomyces, vanderwaltozyma, wickerhamomyces, saccharomyces, and cordyceps  . among them, pichia, galactomyces and vanderwaltozyma were the dominant fungal genera  across all samples. pichia contributed to more than 50% in most samples, except for the samples, els <dig>  f <dig>  e <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  e <dig>  f <dig>  and e <dig>  while galactomyces was prevalent in the samples, f <dig>  f <dig>  and f <dig>  contributing to more than 50% of total fungal sequences. moreover, in the sample e <dig>  vanderwaltozyma contributed to 99% of total fungal sequences.

comparison of the fungal composition between the kalmykia and chita samples
the weighted and unweighted unifrac pcoa was performed to evaluate if any structural difference existed in the fungal community between the two sample groups . although there was slight overlapping between the samples from the two groups on the score plots, data points were largely separated by both weighted   and unweighted   unifrac analysis. however, a further manova test showed that only the unweighted  but not weighted  unifrac distance showed significant difference between sample groups. these results suggest that the structural difference in the fungal community was attributed to the less abundant fungal lineages.

rda was applied to further identify the specific fungal groups that accounted for the difference observed between the kalmykia and chita nfcm samples . mcpt showed that the constrained ordination model by kalmykia or chita was significant . we identified  <dig> otus that fitted well by the sample scores on the canonical axis as key variables; each had at least  <dig> % of the variability in its values explained by this axis. on the rda ordination plot,  <dig> otus were enriched in chita nfcm samples, and they belonged to the genera saccharomyces, pichia, vanderwaltozyma and unidentified trichocomaceae. meanwhile,  <dig> otus were enriched in kalmykia nfcm samples, which mainly belonged to the genera vanderwaltozyma and galactomyces.

discussion
pyrosequencing analysis is able to provide a thorough description of microbiota community in environmental samples, which also helps to reveal their potential function. in the current study, the bacterial and fungal communities of nfcm from kalmykia and chita were studied. firmicutes, proteobacteria, bacteroidetes and actinobacteria were the dominant bacteria at phylum level, while the abundance of acidobacteria was considerably different between the two groups. firmicutes was the most abundant phylum, which was in line with results from some previous studies performed in naturally fermented dairy products, such as kefir  <cit> , fermented seafood  <cit> , kochujang  <cit> , pearl millet slurries  <cit> , and artisanal cheeses  <cit> . the fungal community was dominated with ascomycota, and this phylum was prevalent in korean alcoholic beverages  <cit>  and chinese liquors  <cit> . as reflected by the shannon index and rarefaction analysis, the bacterial diversity and richness were higher than that of the fungi in the same environment, which is consistent with a previous report on tarag  <cit> . the report found that the isolated number and density of lactic acid bacteria were considerably higher than that of yeasts in the studied traditional mongolian fermented dairy products.

lactobacillus and lactococcus were the dominant genera for samples from both kalmykia and chita. these two genera are commonly associated with naturally fermented dairy products  <cit> . lactobacillus was the predominant genus in our samples. the starter cultures of the homemade nfcm in this study were passage from the old nfcm. it was possible that the high proportion of lactobacillus was retained and even enriched during nfcm fermentation. it has been reported that the acid tolerance of lactobacilli is higher than streptococcus and lactococcus  <cit> . some species of lactococcus have low acid tolerance, however, they could be isolated from raw milk and were found growing during the early stage of fermentation  <cit> . these may explain the lower abundance of lactococcus than lactobacillus as seen in our results.

some reports claim that 16s rrna is a slowly diverging molecule and it fails to reveal significant differences between recently diverged species; thus protein-encoding genes  may be used as the phylogenetic markers to ensure an accurate assignment of otus to the species or even subspecies level. our results demonstrate a high resolution of pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene in assigning lactobacillus to the precision of species and subspecies levels. based on phylogenetic grouping of lactobacillus otu representative sequences, l. helveticus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were predominant in the nfcm. a similar lactobacillus composition was reported in the traditional dairy products, airag and tarag  <cit> .

furthermore, the major genera , streptococcus, macrococcus, leuconostoc, enterococcus, acetobacter, citrobacter, acinetobacter, bacillus, kluyvera, enterobacter, were present in our nfcm samples. among them, streptococcus, macrococcus, leuconostoc, and enterococcus have been reported as the subdominant genera in raw milk  <cit>  and cheese  <cit> , which aligned with the results of our study. acinetobacter and enterobacter were detected in mexican alcoholic beverages. it was speculated that these genera were originated from the bacterial contamination in raw milk; and they subsequently decreased during the fermentation process  <cit> .

pichia, galactomyces and vanderwaltozyma were the dominant fungal genera in nfcm. pichia is commonly associated with fermentative metabolic processes of naturally fermented dairy products and cheese  <cit> , as this genus takes part in hydrolyzing milk protein and fat, assimilating lactic acid, and producing ethanol  <cit> . galactomyces has been reported as the dominant yeasts in dairy products, which may involve in lactic acid utilization, proteolysis, lipolysis and flavour development  <cit> . however, a previously published study reported a different makeup of fungal community in two types of traditional mongolian fermented products namely airag and tarag. airag was dominated with the species kluyveromyces marxianus, while the prevalent species in tarag were saccharomyces cerevisiae, issatchenkia orientalis, and kazachstania unispora  <cit> .

our data revealed clear differences in the microbiota of nfcm collected in the two sampling locations. however, at this point, the exact reasons for the observed variation in the microbiota have not been identified. similar to our study, previous reports have found that the exposure of cheese to different external environments during the manufacturing process impacted the microbiota composition of the final products  <cit> . the microbial communities of traditional fermented products, such as fermented milk  <cit>  and kochujiang  <cit> , varied with the sampling geographic or manufacturing region. moreover, animals living at different altitudes, e.g. yak in the tibetan region, may have different resistance to cold environment, leading to an unusual microbiota makeup of yak milk and its fermented products  <cit> . kalmykia and chita are located  <dig>  kilometers apart in southern russia. the nfcm collected from both sites were produced with the same manufacturing process. however, the two places have dissimilar altitude and climate characteristics. kalmykia is located at the east european plain, with averages of about  <dig> meters in elevation  <cit> . it has a continental climate, with very hot and dry summers  and cold winters  with little snow . on the contrary, chita is located at the central siberian plateau and the average elevation is about 500- <dig> meters  <cit> . it is generally colder in chita than kalmykia with the average summer and winter temperatures ranged from +19°c and −16°c, respectively. additionally, chita is comparatively humid than kalmykia with an average annual precipitation of up to  <dig> millimeters. thus, we speculate that the factor of geographic environment including altitudes and climate play a more significant role over the manufacturing process in resulting in the different microbiota compositions of the analyzed products. our unpublished results revealed a higher microbial richness in the mongolian style fermented products made by similar methods collected in russia as compared with those from mongolia and inner mongolia of china. this further confirms that the variation in the microbiota structure of these fermented products may be regional-based.

some other crucial factors that may affect the fermented milk microbiota composition are the hygienic quality of the milk and the manufacturing process, as well as the back slopping technique. these factors may together contribute to the selection of specific microbial groups and affect the ecological succession of the microbial communities during the fermentation process.

CONCLUSIONS
to sum up, the current study analyzed the bacterial and fungal community diversity of nfcm in kalmykia and chita. our results showed that clear structural differences existed in the microbiota of nfcm from kalmykia and chita. the current study has provided interesting insights into the relationship between the microbial composition of nfcm and their geographic regions. the results have also shown that pyrosequencing technique is useful for detecting a wide diversity of microorganisms in nfcm. the results obtained here will be valuable for screening for beneficial strains from traditional fermented dairy products, which are made by the mongolians residing in russia. our study has also provided novel data for mongolian traditional fermented dairy products.

"BACKGROUND
maternal environmental effects occur when the phenotype or growth environment of the mother plant affects the offspring phenotype beyond the direct effect of transmitted genes
<cit> .
the seed is simultaneously an important maternal component and a subsequent offspring.
seed traits of the first generation or even of later generations in some annual plants are dependent on the abiotic environment and seed position on the parent plant during seed development and maturation
<cit> .
seed traits of most species vary between and within individuals, and much of the variation is phenotypic
<cit> .
the adaptive significance of maternal effects on seeds is being increasingly recognized
<cit> .
maternal effects affect a range of offspring traits simultaneously, and these effects are likely to be highly context-dependent
<cit> .
however, most studies of maternal environmental effects on seeds have examined only one maternal factor and one seed trait
<cit> , which may give an incomplete view of the influence of maternal effects
<cit> .
for example, maternal plants of senecio vulgaris grown at lower nutrient levels produced seeds that germinated later and had lower mass than those from plants grown at higher nutrient levels, but their seedlings survived longer when the maternal plant was not supplied with additional nutrients
<cit> .
thus, investigation of the interactive effect of different maternal factors on variation in seed traits is needed to gain a complete understanding of maternal environmental effects on seed quality, and thereby on the regeneration of populations.
using an outcome-based approach, marshall and uller  distinguished four types of maternal effects: anticipatory , selfish , bet-hedging , and transmissive .
although this static framework is useful in distinguishing different types of maternal effects, these effects may be entangled.
seed heteromorphism is a phenomenon in which a single plant produces different morphophysiological types of seeds
<cit> .
seed dimorphism can be considered the main type of this phenomenon, and it is probably a form of bet-hedging that is expressed mostly in annual plants
<cit> .on the basis of this theory, it is predicted that, in an unpredictable environment, bet-hedging maximizes the geometric mean fitness among generations
<cit> .
however, most studies have focused on changes in the mean offspring phenotype, and only a few studies have been done on variation in offspring phenotypes
<cit> .
in fact, there is variation even within each type of seed in heteromorphic species
<cit> .
to our knowledge, no study has been done on the comparison of seed size variation of heteromorphic species under different environmental regimes.
here we focus on soil fertility and salinity as possible drivers of maternal effects on regeneration.
nutrient availability to the maternal plant could potentially affect seed production and seed traits
<cit> .
for example, seed production and seed size, germination and other seed quality traits of sarcobatus vermiculatus were decreased substantially with nutrient limitation
<cit> .
this may be a selfish maternal effect, i.e.
plants may decrease seed quality and thereby increase total maternal fitness when there is a reduction in the quality of the maternal environment.
anticipatory maternal effects are predicted to be advantageous in systems where germination conditions are spatially or temporally variable but in a somewhat predictable manner
<cit> .
for example, campanula americana grows in habitats where light is a patchily distributed resource, and their seeds typically experience the same light environment as their mother plant.
germination percentage of this species in autumn was higher when the offspring light environment matched the maternal environment
<cit> .
however, knowledge about the effect of maternal salinity environment on germination of offspring seeds is limited
<cit> .
we expect that seeds produced by maternal plants growing at high salinity would have higher salt tolerance than those produced by mother plants growing at low salinity, because the saline environment is predictable for the offspring of these seeds.
suaeda aralocaspica  freitag & schütze  is an annual halophyte which is 20–50 cm tall.
it occurs in the gobi desert of central asia, where it grows in saline-alkaline sandy soils
<cit> .
this species is a model organism for studying interacting maternal effects on regeneration because it occurs  in a heterogeneous environment in terms of soil salinity and fertility; and  its seeds are dimorphic
<cit> .
s. aralocaspica plants produce brown seeds  and black seeds
<cit> .
in this study, we tested the hypothesis that seed dimorphism, nutrients and salinity determine variation in offspring seed traits and germination success of s. aralocaspica via the combination of bet-hedging, selfish and anticipatory maternal effects.
this main hypothesis leads to the following specific hypotheses:
the seed morph ratio of s. aralocaspica can be fine-tuned by plant phenotype  and environmental conditions .
we predict that the brown:black seed ratio should decrease under stressful conditions and therefore be negatively correlated with nutrient limitation and salinity.
additionally, we predict that the brown:black seed morph ratio of plants grown from brown seeds should be higher than that of plants reared from black seeds, because brown seeds germinate faster and these plants may therefore experience better growth conditions during the short window of opportunity for establishment than those from black seeds.
the size variation of brown seeds should be higher than that of black seeds, because brown seeds are dispersed further away from the mother plant than are black seeds; consequently, plants from brown seeds may experience more unpredictable environments.
further, low nutrient and high salinity levels should increase seed size variation.
maternal nutrient limitation should decrease seed size and germination percentage of s. aralocaspica.
RESULTS
seed morph ratio
the brown:black seed ratio was significantly affected by plant type , the interaction between seed type and salinity  and the interaction among seed type, salinity and nutrient level  .
there were no significant differences in the ratio between plants from brown seeds and plants from black seeds under any salt treatment at low or moderate nutrient regimes .
results of three-way anova with the following factors: plant type, salinity and nutrient.
ratio: number of brown seeds/number of black seeds.
in the common garden experiment, the seed morph ratio per plant was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in plants from brown seeds and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in plants from black seeds .
seed size
there was a significant effect of salinity alone or in combination with plant type or nutrients on diameter of brown seeds.
in contrast, there were no effect of plant type or nutrients on diameter of brown seeds and no significant interactive effect between plant type and nutrient regime .
salinity significantly decreased the diameter of brown seeds in the low and moderate nutrient regimes, but not in the high nutrient regime .
the main effects of salinity and of nutrients on diameter of black seeds were significant.
additionally, there were significant interactive effects between seed type and salinity  and between seed type and nutrients  on diameter of black seeds .
high nutrients produced the thinnest black seeds.
black seeds in the low salinity treatment were widest in the low and moderate nutrient regimes .
brown seeds were significantly wider than black seeds  .
coefficient of variation  of seed size
the effects of seed type on cv of seed diameter varied by treatment, with black seeds having a higher cv of diameter in  <dig> treatments  and brown seeds having a higher cv of diameter in two treatments ; the latter under  <dig> salinity and moderate nutrients and under high salinity and low nutrients .
under low maternal nutrient conditions, cv for seed diameter in plants from brown seeds was relatively small, and seeds produced on plants grown at high salinity had the lowest cv for diameter, while those grown at control salinity had the highest cv .
under moderate maternal nutrients, seeds produced on plants grown at high salinity had the lowest cv for diameter, while those grown at control salinity had the highest cv .
cv for seed diameter in plants from brown seeds under high maternal nutrients was highest when grown under low salinity .
under low maternal salinity, cv of seed diameter in plants from black seeds was relatively small, and seeds produced by plants grown in low maternal nutrient conditions had the smallest cv for diameter .
under moderate maternal nutrient conditions, cv for seed diameter in plants from black seeds was highest .
seed germination
germination of s. aralocaspica seeds was significantly affected by maternal soil nutrient levels, salinity and seed morph but not by type of mother plant .
germination percentage of brown seeds was higher than that of black seeds under all treatments.
maternal nutrient level did not affect germination percentage of brown seeds.
for black seeds, higher maternal nutrient levels significantly decreased germination percentage .
high maternal salinity significantly increased germination percentage of brown seeds for high maternal nutrient level  and of black seeds for moderate maternal nutrient level .
when brown seeds were germinated in  <dig> and 200 mmol l- <dig> nacl solution, maternal salinity did not affect germination, except for brown seeds from plants incubated at high maternal nutrient level.
when brown seeds were germinated in 800 mmol l- <dig> nacl solution, high maternal salinity significantly increased final germination percentages for moderate  and high  maternal nutrient levels .
however, seed viability was not affected by salt concentration and the percentage of total viable seed was  <dig>
discussion
our study of maternal environment effects on seed traits in the s. aralocaspica produced four main results.
plants reared from brown seeds had a higher brown:black seed ratio than those reared from black seeds, and soil nutrient and salinity levels did not significantly affect seed morph ratio.
seed dimorphism, nutrient and salinity regulated seed size variation.
maternal nutrient limitation significantly increased seed size and germination percentage of black but not brown seeds.
seeds produced by plants growing at high salinity had higher salt tolerance than those from low salinity plants.
the first and second results support bet-hedging maternal effects.
the third result did not support selfish maternal effects, but it did support anticipatory maternal effects.
the fourth result also supports anticipatory maternal effects.
bet-hedging
seed dimorphism may be a typical example of diversified bet-hedging, where offspring produced by each plant has two distinct ecological strategies to cope with variable environments.
our study revealed that the brown:black seed ratio of s. aralocaspica is not controlled by variable maternal environmental conditions but by plant type  .
however, environmentally-altered ratios of seed morphs previously have been reported
<cit> .
a consistent trend for the ratio / has been found in amphicarpic plants
<cit> .
thus, under stressful conditions plants tend to produce relatively more subterranean seeds with low dispersibility, and under very stressful conditions no aerial seeds are produced
<cit> .
for heteromorphic plants, stressful conditions may increase
<cit> , decrease
<cit>  or not alter
<cit>  the seed morph ratio.
plants of the amphicarpic species emex spinosa <cit> , cardamine chenopodifolia <cit>  and catananche lutea <cit>  from subterranean seeds produced more aerial fruits and seeds and allocated more biomass to aerial reproduction than those from aerial seeds.
a decrease under stress of the ratio / in amphicarpic plants has not been found in most heterodiasporous plants.
plants reared from black seeds of chenopodium album  produced more brown seeds than plants from brown seeds, but this phenomenon was only observed for plants reared at 50 mmol l- <dig> nacl
<cit> .
plants reared from heteromorphic diaspores of dimorphotheca sinuata  and arctotis fastuosa  did not differ in ratio of seed morphs
<cit> .
our results indicated that plants grown from brown seeds produced a higher brown:black seed ratio than those produced from plants grown from black seeds in all nutrient and salinity treatments, which was confirmed by the common garden experiment.
this pattern can be considered as a new model of heteromorphic species behavior.
that is, the seed morph ratio of s. aralocaspica remains constant despite changes in maternal nutrient supply and salinity.
the influence of plant type on seed morph ratio may have important consequences for ecological adaptation.
brown seeds have high germinability and dispersability and represent the high risk strategy
<cit> , whereas black seeds have low germinability and dispersability and represent the low risk strategy
<cit> .
thus, the brown:black seed ratio may represent the ratio of /, a risk index.
given that plants grown from brown seeds have a higher risk index, it is expected that most plants in new habitats came from brown seeds.
meanwhile, plants reared from black seeds have a lower risk index and remain in the maternal habitats, especially those that are frequently disturbed.
hence, our results suggest plastic bet-hedging in the halophyte s. aralocaspica that allows plants to cope with unpredictable environmental variability.
dynamic bet-hedging
theory suggests that mothers should increase within-clutch variation in the offspring phenotype when they can not predict their offspring’s environmental conditions
<cit> .
in s. aralocaspica, size variation of black seeds is higher than that of brown seeds .
seed dispersal is often limited, and most seeds of plants are dispersed relatively close to the maternal plant
<cit> .
primary  and secondary  seed dispersal of s. aralocaspica is limited.
most brown and black seeds are likely to remain in their mother’s habitat, though dispersal distance of brown seeds is greater than that of black seeds .
all brown seeds germinate the next spring following maturity in autumn.
only a portion of the black seeds, which have non-deep physiological dormancy, can germinate in their first spring, and the others become part of a persistent soil seed bank
<cit> .
therefore, compared to brown seeds black seeds experience more unpredictable temporal environments and have higher variation in seed size.
plants of s. aralocaspica grown from brown seeds produced seeds with lower size variation under low levels of nutrient and high salinity, and plants grown from black seeds produced seeds with lower size variation under low levels of nutrients and salinity .
thus, low nutrient and high salinity are predictable environmental conditions for plants grown from brown seeds, and low levels of nutrients and salinity are predictable environmental conditions for plants grown from black seeds.
in salt deserts, low nutrient levels are predictable, and seeds produced by plants of s. aralocaspica from brown and black seeds had the lowest cv under low nutrient.
brown seeds can germinate at high salinity, and seedlings from brown seeds can survive at high salinity.
thus, the high maternal salinity is predictable for plants from brown seeds.
however, black seeds germinate at low salinity, and seedlings from black seeds survive at low salinity.
hence the low maternal salinity is predictable for plants from black seeds.
seed size variation in response to changes in environmental predictability may be viewed as dynamic bet-hedging, an adaptive maternal effect
<cit> .
our study is the first to demonstrate variation of seed size of each seed morph as affected by specific maternal environment.
anticipatory maternal effects
while maternal nutrient limitation simply reduces the number of seeds, its impact on seed size and germination is more complex.
nutrient limitation is reported to decrease, to increase or not to change seed size and germination percentage
<cit> .
the most striking finding of our study was that maternal nutrient limitation increased size of black seeds but had no significant effect on size of brown seeds in s. aralocaspica .
the physiological mechanism of this phenomenon needs to be explored.
varying environmental conditions may cause changes not only in seed size but also in germination percentage.
changes in seed size may be related to seed germination; in many cases large seeds germinate better than small ones
<cit> .
our black seeds produced under low levels of nutrients had the widest diameter and the highest germination percentage.
a large store of resources allows black seeds to germinate successfully under low nutrient conditions, thereby enhancing offspring fitness in s. aralocaspica.
under stressful conditions, maternal fitness is increased by increasing offspring fitness.
in mother plants, size and germination of black seeds is adjusted according to local nutrient conditions and thus maximize offspring and maternal fitness.
this phenotypic plasticity is the anticipatory maternal effect also found in other plants
<cit> .
maternal environment salinity had strong effects on seed germination in s. aralocaspica.
seeds produced by plants grown at high maternal salinity had higher germination percentages than those produced by plants grown in low maternal salinity regardless of germination salinity .
previous work demonstrated that seeds from maternal plants grown at high salinity germinated more readily at high salinity than seeds from low-salinity plants
<cit> .
the salinity environment of maternal plants of atriplex nummularia profoundly affected the germination response of their seeds
<cit> .
iris hexagona seeds from high-salinity mothers germinated earlier than those from low-salinity mothers, but these effects were not detectable 10 days after germination
<cit> .
maternal effects that have a significant influence on plant fitness may confer a fitness advantage in environmental conditions similar to those experienced by the parents
<cit> .
the pattern of germination percentage in s. aralocaspica suggests that maternal effects are more strongly expressed at high than at low salinity.
we suspect that this kind of maternal effect is an anticipatory maternal effect
<cit> .
CONCLUSIONS
we have documented multiple maternal effects on seed traits of s. aralocaspica.
as predicted, seed morph ratio and seed size variation fine-tuned by maternal factors are bet-hedging maternal effects.
increase in salt tolerance of offspring seeds through the effects of maternal salinity are anticipatory maternal effects.
increase in seed size and in germination percentage through maternal nutrient limitation is also an anticipatory as opposed to selfish maternal effect.
multiple interacting aspects of maternal plant phenotype and maternal environments together determine various seed traits via different maternal effects.
our findings add to the increasing evidence that plants have evolved multiple maternal mechanisms that, together, may help to optimize long-term regeneration and maintenance of populations in environments with varying and unpredictable levels of environmental stress.
",133,"BACKGROUND
maternal environmental effects occur when the phenotype or growth environment of the mother plant affects the offspring phenotype beyond the direct effect of transmitted genes
 <cit> . the seed is simultaneously an important maternal component and a subsequent offspring. seed traits of the first generation or even of later generations in some annual plants are dependent on the abiotic environment and seed position on the parent plant during seed development and maturation
 <cit> . seed traits of most species vary between and within individuals, and much of the variation is phenotypic
 <cit> . the adaptive significance of maternal effects on seeds is being increasingly recognized
 <cit> .

maternal effects affect a range of offspring traits simultaneously, and these effects are likely to be highly context-dependent
 <cit> . however, most studies of maternal environmental effects on seeds have examined only one maternal factor and one seed trait
 <cit> , which may give an incomplete view of the influence of maternal effects
 <cit> . for example, maternal plants of senecio vulgaris grown at lower nutrient levels produced seeds that germinated later and had lower mass than those from plants grown at higher nutrient levels, but their seedlings survived longer when the maternal plant was not supplied with additional nutrients
 <cit> . thus, investigation of the interactive effect of different maternal factors on variation in seed traits is needed to gain a complete understanding of maternal environmental effects on seed quality, and thereby on the regeneration of populations.

using an outcome-based approach, marshall and uller  distinguished four types of maternal effects: anticipatory , selfish , bet-hedging , and transmissive . although this static framework is useful in distinguishing different types of maternal effects, these effects may be entangled.

seed heteromorphism is a phenomenon in which a single plant produces different morphophysiological types of seeds
 <cit> . seed dimorphism can be considered the main type of this phenomenon, and it is probably a form of bet-hedging that is expressed mostly in annual plants
 <cit> .on the basis of this theory, it is predicted that, in an unpredictable environment, bet-hedging maximizes the geometric mean fitness among generations
 <cit> . however, most studies have focused on changes in the mean offspring phenotype, and only a few studies have been done on variation in offspring phenotypes
 <cit> . in fact, there is variation even within each type of seed in heteromorphic species
 <cit> . to our knowledge, no study has been done on the comparison of seed size variation of heteromorphic species under different environmental regimes. here we focus on soil fertility and salinity as possible drivers of maternal effects on regeneration.

nutrient availability to the maternal plant could potentially affect seed production and seed traits
 <cit> . for example, seed production and seed size, germination and other seed quality traits of sarcobatus vermiculatus were decreased substantially with nutrient limitation
 <cit> . this may be a selfish maternal effect, i.e. plants may decrease seed quality and thereby increase total maternal fitness when there is a reduction in the quality of the maternal environment.

anticipatory maternal effects are predicted to be advantageous in systems where germination conditions are spatially or temporally variable but in a somewhat predictable manner
 <cit> . for example, campanula americana grows in habitats where light is a patchily distributed resource, and their seeds typically experience the same light environment as their mother plant. germination percentage of this species in autumn was higher when the offspring light environment matched the maternal environment
 <cit> . however, knowledge about the effect of maternal salinity environment on germination of offspring seeds is limited
 <cit> . we expect that seeds produced by maternal plants growing at high salinity would have higher salt tolerance than those produced by mother plants growing at low salinity, because the saline environment is predictable for the offspring of these seeds.

suaeda aralocaspica  freitag & schütze  is an annual halophyte which is 20–50 cm tall. it occurs in the gobi desert of central asia, where it grows in saline-alkaline sandy soils
 <cit> . this species is a model organism for studying interacting maternal effects on regeneration because it occurs  in a heterogeneous environment in terms of soil salinity and fertility; and  its seeds are dimorphic
 <cit> . s. aralocaspica plants produce brown seeds  and black seeds 
 <cit> . in this study, we tested the hypothesis that seed dimorphism, nutrients and salinity determine variation in offspring seed traits and germination success of s. aralocaspica via the combination of bet-hedging, selfish and anticipatory maternal effects. this main hypothesis leads to the following specific hypotheses:

 the seed morph ratio of s. aralocaspica can be fine-tuned by plant phenotype  and environmental conditions . we predict that the brown:black seed ratio should decrease under stressful conditions and therefore be negatively correlated with nutrient limitation and salinity. additionally, we predict that the brown:black seed morph ratio of plants grown from brown seeds should be higher than that of plants reared from black seeds, because brown seeds germinate faster and these plants may therefore experience better growth conditions during the short window of opportunity for establishment than those from black seeds.

 the size variation of brown seeds should be higher than that of black seeds, because brown seeds are dispersed further away from the mother plant than are black seeds; consequently, plants from brown seeds may experience more unpredictable environments. further, low nutrient and high salinity levels should increase seed size variation.

 maternal nutrient limitation should decrease seed size and germination percentage of s. aralocaspica.

RESULTS
seed morph ratio
the brown:black seed ratio was significantly affected by plant type , the interaction between seed type and salinity  and the interaction among seed type, salinity and nutrient level  . there were no significant differences in the ratio between plants from brown seeds and plants from black seeds under any salt treatment at low or moderate nutrient regimes .

results of three-way anova with the following factors: plant type, salinity and nutrient.

ratio: number of brown seeds/number of black seeds.

in the common garden experiment, the seed morph ratio per plant was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in plants from brown seeds and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in plants from black seeds .

seed size
there was a significant effect of salinity alone or in combination with plant type or nutrients on diameter of brown seeds. in contrast, there were no effect of plant type or nutrients on diameter of brown seeds and no significant interactive effect between plant type and nutrient regime . salinity significantly decreased the diameter of brown seeds in the low and moderate nutrient regimes, but not in the high nutrient regime .

the main effects of salinity and of nutrients on diameter of black seeds were significant. additionally, there were significant interactive effects between seed type and salinity  and between seed type and nutrients  on diameter of black seeds . high nutrients produced the thinnest black seeds. black seeds in the low salinity treatment were widest in the low and moderate nutrient regimes . brown seeds were significantly wider than black seeds  .

coefficient of variation  of seed size
the effects of seed type on cv of seed diameter varied by treatment, with black seeds having a higher cv of diameter in  <dig> treatments  and brown seeds having a higher cv of diameter in two treatments ; the latter under  <dig> salinity and moderate nutrients and under high salinity and low nutrients .

under low maternal nutrient conditions, cv for seed diameter in plants from brown seeds was relatively small, and seeds produced on plants grown at high salinity had the lowest cv for diameter, while those grown at control salinity had the highest cv . under moderate maternal nutrients, seeds produced on plants grown at high salinity had the lowest cv for diameter, while those grown at control salinity had the highest cv . cv for seed diameter in plants from brown seeds under high maternal nutrients was highest when grown under low salinity .

under low maternal salinity, cv of seed diameter in plants from black seeds was relatively small, and seeds produced by plants grown in low maternal nutrient conditions had the smallest cv for diameter . under moderate maternal nutrient conditions, cv for seed diameter in plants from black seeds was highest .

seed germination
germination of s. aralocaspica seeds was significantly affected by maternal soil nutrient levels, salinity and seed morph but not by type of mother plant . germination percentage of brown seeds was higher than that of black seeds under all treatments. maternal nutrient level did not affect germination percentage of brown seeds. for black seeds, higher maternal nutrient levels significantly decreased germination percentage . high maternal salinity significantly increased germination percentage of brown seeds for high maternal nutrient level  and of black seeds for moderate maternal nutrient level .

when brown seeds were germinated in  <dig> and 200 mmol l- <dig> nacl solution, maternal salinity did not affect germination, except for brown seeds from plants incubated at high maternal nutrient level. when brown seeds were germinated in 800 mmol l- <dig> nacl solution, high maternal salinity significantly increased final germination percentages for moderate  and high  maternal nutrient levels . however, seed viability was not affected by salt concentration and the percentage of total viable seed was  <dig> 

discussion
our study of maternal environment effects on seed traits in the s. aralocaspica produced four main results.  plants reared from brown seeds had a higher brown:black seed ratio than those reared from black seeds, and soil nutrient and salinity levels did not significantly affect seed morph ratio.  seed dimorphism, nutrient and salinity regulated seed size variation.  maternal nutrient limitation significantly increased seed size and germination percentage of black but not brown seeds.  seeds produced by plants growing at high salinity had higher salt tolerance than those from low salinity plants. the first and second results support bet-hedging maternal effects. the third result did not support selfish maternal effects, but it did support anticipatory maternal effects. the fourth result also supports anticipatory maternal effects.

bet-hedging
seed dimorphism may be a typical example of diversified bet-hedging, where offspring produced by each plant has two distinct ecological strategies to cope with variable environments. our study revealed that the brown:black seed ratio of s. aralocaspica is not controlled by variable maternal environmental conditions but by plant type  . however, environmentally-altered ratios of seed morphs previously have been reported
 <cit> . a consistent trend for the ratio / has been found in amphicarpic plants
 <cit> . thus, under stressful conditions plants tend to produce relatively more subterranean seeds with low dispersibility, and under very stressful conditions no aerial seeds are produced
 <cit> . for heteromorphic plants, stressful conditions may increase
 <cit> , decrease
 <cit>  or not alter
 <cit>  the seed morph ratio. plants of the amphicarpic species emex spinosa <cit> , cardamine chenopodifolia <cit>  and catananche lutea <cit>  from subterranean seeds produced more aerial fruits and seeds and allocated more biomass to aerial reproduction than those from aerial seeds.

a decrease under stress of the ratio / in amphicarpic plants has not been found in most heterodiasporous plants. plants reared from black seeds of chenopodium album  produced more brown seeds than plants from brown seeds, but this phenomenon was only observed for plants reared at 50 mmol l- <dig> nacl
 <cit> . plants reared from heteromorphic diaspores of dimorphotheca sinuata  and arctotis fastuosa  did not differ in ratio of seed morphs
 <cit> . our results indicated that plants grown from brown seeds produced a higher brown:black seed ratio than those produced from plants grown from black seeds in all nutrient and salinity treatments, which was confirmed by the common garden experiment. this pattern can be considered as a new model of heteromorphic species behavior. that is, the seed morph ratio of s. aralocaspica remains constant despite changes in maternal nutrient supply and salinity. the influence of plant type on seed morph ratio may have important consequences for ecological adaptation. brown seeds have high germinability and dispersability and represent the high risk strategy
 <cit> , whereas black seeds have low germinability and dispersability and represent the low risk strategy
 <cit> . thus, the brown:black seed ratio may represent the ratio of /, a risk index. given that plants grown from brown seeds have a higher risk index, it is expected that most plants in new habitats came from brown seeds. meanwhile, plants reared from black seeds have a lower risk index and remain in the maternal habitats, especially those that are frequently disturbed. hence, our results suggest plastic bet-hedging in the halophyte s. aralocaspica that allows plants to cope with unpredictable environmental variability.

dynamic bet-hedging
theory suggests that mothers should increase within-clutch variation in the offspring phenotype when they can not predict their offspring’s environmental conditions
 <cit> . in s. aralocaspica, size variation of black seeds is higher than that of brown seeds . seed dispersal is often limited, and most seeds of plants are dispersed relatively close to the maternal plant
 <cit> . primary  and secondary  seed dispersal of s. aralocaspica is limited. most brown and black seeds are likely to remain in their mother’s habitat, though dispersal distance of brown seeds is greater than that of black seeds . all brown seeds germinate the next spring following maturity in autumn. only a portion of the black seeds, which have non-deep physiological dormancy, can germinate in their first spring, and the others become part of a persistent soil seed bank
 <cit> . therefore, compared to brown seeds black seeds experience more unpredictable temporal environments and have higher variation in seed size.

plants of s. aralocaspica grown from brown seeds produced seeds with lower size variation under low levels of nutrient and high salinity, and plants grown from black seeds produced seeds with lower size variation under low levels of nutrients and salinity . thus, low nutrient and high salinity are predictable environmental conditions for plants grown from brown seeds, and low levels of nutrients and salinity are predictable environmental conditions for plants grown from black seeds. in salt deserts, low nutrient levels are predictable, and seeds produced by plants of s. aralocaspica from brown and black seeds had the lowest cv under low nutrient. brown seeds can germinate at high salinity, and seedlings from brown seeds can survive at high salinity. thus, the high maternal salinity is predictable for plants from brown seeds. however, black seeds germinate at low salinity, and seedlings from black seeds survive at low salinity. hence the low maternal salinity is predictable for plants from black seeds. seed size variation in response to changes in environmental predictability may be viewed as dynamic bet-hedging, an adaptive maternal effect
 <cit> . our study is the first to demonstrate variation of seed size of each seed morph as affected by specific maternal environment.

anticipatory maternal effects
while maternal nutrient limitation simply reduces the number of seeds, its impact on seed size and germination is more complex. nutrient limitation is reported to decrease, to increase or not to change seed size and germination percentage
 <cit> . the most striking finding of our study was that maternal nutrient limitation increased size of black seeds but had no significant effect on size of brown seeds in s. aralocaspica . the physiological mechanism of this phenomenon needs to be explored. varying environmental conditions may cause changes not only in seed size but also in germination percentage. changes in seed size may be related to seed germination; in many cases large seeds germinate better than small ones
 <cit> . our black seeds produced under low levels of nutrients had the widest diameter and the highest germination percentage. a large store of resources allows black seeds to germinate successfully under low nutrient conditions, thereby enhancing offspring fitness in s. aralocaspica. under stressful conditions, maternal fitness is increased by increasing offspring fitness. in mother plants, size and germination of black seeds is adjusted according to local nutrient conditions and thus maximize offspring and maternal fitness. this phenotypic plasticity is the anticipatory maternal effect also found in other plants
 <cit> .

maternal environment salinity had strong effects on seed germination in s. aralocaspica. seeds produced by plants grown at high maternal salinity had higher germination percentages than those produced by plants grown in low maternal salinity regardless of germination salinity . previous work demonstrated that seeds from maternal plants grown at high salinity germinated more readily at high salinity than seeds from low-salinity plants
 <cit> . the salinity environment of maternal plants of atriplex nummularia profoundly affected the germination response of their seeds
 <cit> . iris hexagona seeds from high-salinity mothers germinated earlier than those from low-salinity mothers, but these effects were not detectable 10 days after germination
 <cit> . maternal effects that have a significant influence on plant fitness may confer a fitness advantage in environmental conditions similar to those experienced by the parents
 <cit> . the pattern of germination percentage in s. aralocaspica suggests that maternal effects are more strongly expressed at high than at low salinity. we suspect that this kind of maternal effect is an anticipatory maternal effect
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have documented multiple maternal effects on seed traits of s. aralocaspica. as predicted, seed morph ratio and seed size variation fine-tuned by maternal factors are bet-hedging maternal effects. increase in salt tolerance of offspring seeds through the effects of maternal salinity are anticipatory maternal effects. increase in seed size and in germination percentage through maternal nutrient limitation is also an anticipatory as opposed to selfish maternal effect. multiple interacting aspects of maternal plant phenotype and maternal environments together determine various seed traits via different maternal effects. our findings add to the increasing evidence that plants have evolved multiple maternal mechanisms that, together, may help to optimize long-term regeneration and maintenance of populations in environments with varying and unpredictable levels of environmental stress.

"BACKGROUND
the notch pathway, a highly conserved signaling module, participates in diverse aspects of animal development, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and pattern formation  <cit> .
upon ligand binding, notch undergoes proteolytic processing, resulting in the release and the nuclear translocation of nicd  for transcriptional activation  <cit> .
as the notch receptor and its ligands are widely expressed, the activities of this important pathway need to be regulated at multiple levels to prevent inappropriate signaling output.
recent evidence from several systems has suggested that ligand endocytosis plays a key role in regulating the activity of this cascade, although its exact function in notch signaling remains unclear.
genetic analysis using drosophila has identified several factors required for ligand endocytosis during notch signaling.
in drosophila, there are two known notch ligands, delta  and serrate , both of which appear to utilize an ubiquitin-mediated endocytic pathway to activate notch  <cit> .
while polyubiquitination is known to facilitate protein degradation, covalent addition of a single ubiquitin moiety to the cytoplasmic tails of membrane proteins can serve as an internalization signal  <cit> .
the ubiquitination of dl and ser for internalization is mediated by neuralized  and mind bomb , two structurally unrelated but functionally similar e <dig> ubiquitin ligases  <cit> .
the subsequent recruitment of ubiquitinated notch ligands into clathrin-coated vesicles is thought to depend on liquid facets , a cargo-specific clathrin adaptor  <cit> .
dynamin, a gtpase required for the pinching-off of clathrin-coated vesicles  from the plasma membrane, is also required for this event  <cit> .
moreover, during the asymmetric cell division of sensory organ precursors, rab <dig>  and sec <dig>  have been shown to promote notch signaling and regulate dl trafficking  <cit> .
mutations in drosophila auxilin , a j-domain-containing regulator in clathrin-mediated transport, were recently shown to disrupt notch-dependent processes  <cit> .
although originally identified as a factor promoting the assembly of clathrin cage from free triskelia  <cit> , efforts investigating the role of auxilin during clathrin-mediated endocytosis  have mostly focused on its cooperation with hsc <dig> in mediating the disassembly of clathrin coats form nascent ccvs  <cit> .
in mammals, there are two different auxilin-like molecules , differing in their tissue distributions and the presence of a n-terminal ark family kinase domain  <cit> .
in contrast, the drosophila genome contains only one auxilin ortholog, which is structurally more similar to gak, as it contains a n-terminal kinase domain, followed by a pten  homologous region, a clathrin-binding domain, and a c-terminal dnaj domain   <cit> .
biochemical data suggest that the cbm  and j-domain recruit atp-bound hsc <dig> to ccvs and stimulate the atpase activity of hsc <dig>  which drive the disassembly of clathrin coats  <cit> .
the pten-related region appears to be critical for the membrane recruitment of auxilin to clathrin-rich regions  <cit> .
the n-terminal kinase is known to phosphorylate subunits of ap <dig> and ap <dig> adaptor complexes, possibly modulating the affinity of these adaptors for cargoes  <cit> .
however, as not all auxilin homologs  contain the kinase and the pten-related region  <cit> , the physiological relevance of these domains remains to be determined.
initially, the identification of auxilin as a component of the drosophila notch pathway suggests that, to activate notch, ligand endocytosis needs to proceed past the step of clathrin cage disassembly.
this implies that the relevance of ligand endocytosis is not the internalization per se, but a transit of ligand through subsequent endocytic compartments.
however, this interpretation hinges on the assumption that auxilin participates solely in clathrin uncoating under physiological conditions.
recent in vitro investigations have suggested several new functions of auxilin during cme  <cit> , including facilitating clathrin exchange during ccv formation  <cit> , binding to adaptor complexes  <cit> , binding to dynamin to facilitate the constriction of coated pits  <cit> , and chaperoning dissociated clathrin for subsequent rounds of endocytosis  <cit> .
thus, to understand the significance of ligand endocytosis in notch, it is critical to determine whether daux is exclusively involved in clathrin uncoating or has additional roles during cme under physiological conditions.
using strong daux alleles generated from an frt-containing chromosome, we have obtained compelling evidences that daux mutations cause defects in multiple notch-dependent processes and daux function is required in the signaling cells.
although the relevant cargo for daux during notch signaling seems to be dl, the endocytic function of daux is not limited to the notch ligand, as the internalizations of other membrane proteins also appear disrupted.
deletion analysis shows that over-expressed cbm and j-domain are sufficient for daux function, suggesting that the recruitment of hsc <dig> to ccvs is a core function of daux.
furthermore, while the disruption of daux function alters the sub-cellular clathrin distribution, dl appears to be trapped at the cell surface, away from the abnormal clathrin-positive structures.
together, our data support a model, in which daux facilitates notch ligand endocytosis by regulating clathrin dynamics.
moreover, the fact that dl is trapped at the plasma membrane in daux mutants suggests that the linking of daux to the notch pathway does not exclude the possibility that the notch ligand internalization per se plays a pivotal role in activating notch.
RESULTS
mutations in daux kinase- or j-domains disrupt photoreceptor specification
to further understand the role of daux under physiological conditions, we have isolated additional daux mutations from several rounds of f <dig> non-complementation screens.
we have nine mutations in daux, and, for eight of these nine alleles, the molecular lesions are known .
furthermore, three of these alleles, namely dauxl78h, dauxf956*, and dauxg257e, were generated from an frt-containing chromosome; thus permitting daux phenotypic analysis in clones.
to assess the strength of these daux alleles, the lethal phases of animals carrying these daux mutations over dfed <dig>  a deletion  that removes the entire daux locus, were determined.
five of these alleles , when trans-heterozygous with the deletion, died prior to the larval stage.
three of them, dauxs214*, dauxw254*, and dauxw328*, all contain nonsense mutations within the n-terminal kinase domain, suggesting that they are strong or null alleles.
the early lethal phase of dauxf956* and dauxw1150*, two nonsense mutations near the c-terminus, most likely reflects the importance of the j-domain in daux function.
this analysis indicated that dauxl78h and dauxg257e, two missense mutations disrupting highly conserved residues in the sub-domain ii and ix of the n-terminal kinase domain  <cit>  respectively, are weaker alleles.
thus, the allele series, in descending allelic strength, can be described as: s214*≈w254*≈w328* > f956*≈w1150* > l78h≈g257e > i670k .
previous studies have shown that mutations in the pten-related region cause defects in photoreceptor specification  <cit> .
to test whether mutations in other daux domains have similar effects, flp-induced mutant clones of dauxl78h and dauxf956*, mutations disrupting the kinase and the j-domain respectively, were stained with α-elav, which labels the nuclei of neuronal cells  <cit> .
in wild-type tissues, an organized set of eight elav-positive cells is formed in each cluster.
in contrast, as shown in figure 1b–e, increased numbers of disorganized elav-positive cells were seen in both dauxl78h and dauxf956* mutant clones .
this suggests that the integrity of the kinase and the j-domain, in addition to the pten-related region, is important for the function of daux during neuronal cell specification.
in addition, this neural hypertrophy exhibited by dauxf956* tissues seemed to be more severe than those of dauxl78h , correlating well with the allelic strength defined by the lethal phase analysis.
notch-dependent proneural enhancement and lateral inhibition are both disrupted in daux mutant tissues
the drosophila compound eye consists of regular arrays of ~ <dig> ommatidia, each containing eight stereotypically positioned photoreceptors  and other accessory cells.
the formation of this elaborate pattern is initiated in the larval eye imaginal disc along the morphogenetic furrow , which sweeps from posterior to anterior across the eye disc  <cit> .
behind the furrow, undifferentiated cells are sequentially recruited to adopt distinct developmental fates.
to further understand the roles of daux in photoreceptor cell differentiation, we investigated the effect of daux mutations on the specification of r <dig>  the founder cell within each cluster.
the specification of r <dig> cells is known to require at least two notch-dependent events: 1) proneural enhancement: an up-regulation of atonal   <cit>  expression in cells near the morphogenetic furrow to confer them the capability to adopt a neuronal fate, and 2) lateral inhibition: a subsequent restriction of the broad ato expression to one single r <dig> cell per cluster behind the mf  <cit> .
to determine if daux is required for these processes, mosaic eye discs containing dauxf956* mutant clones were stained for ato.
as shown in figure 2a, most dauxf956* mutant cells located near the mf expressed less ato than their wild-type counterpart, suggesting that daux has a role in the proneural enhancement event.
noticeably, some dauxf956* mutant cells at the clone border still expressed an elevated level of ato .
one plausible explanation is that daux functions non-cell-autonomously during notch signaling ; therefore, the notch pathway in these dauxf956* mutant cells could still be activated because they were juxtaposed to the wild-type cells.
behind the mf in normal eye discs, the broad ato expression is gradually restricted, by notch-mediated lateral inhibition, to a single cell in each cluster.
unlike wild type, dauxf956* mutant tissues contained clumps of multiple ato-positive cells that are not restricted into single ato-expressing cells , suggesting that the process of restricting ato expression was disrupted.
to further confirm that lateral inhibition during r <dig> specification was affected by daux, flp-induced eye disc clones were stained for senseless , a zn finger-containing transcription factor expressed in the nuclei of r <dig> cells  <cit> .
unlike ato, whose expression disappears in more mature r <dig> cells, sens expression persists in all r <dig> cells in the eye disc  <cit> .
similar to the ato staining, clusters of extra sens-positive nuclei were seen in dauxf956* mutant tissues after the furrow .
together, these observations suggest that both proneural enhancement and lateral inhibition, two known notch-dependent processes, require daux.
mutations in daux disrupt the formation of the dorsal-ventral wing boundary
to ask if daux regulates other notch-dependent processes, we examined the effect of daux mutations on the formation of the dorsal-ventral  boundary in the developing wing discs.
in normal wing discs, cells in both the dorsal and ventral compartments express notch.
however, because of the modification of notch receptor by fringe in the dorsal compartment  <cit> , these dorsal cells respond preferentially to dl signaling from cells in the ventral compartment.
conversely, the cells in the ventral half respond preferentially to the other notch ligand, ser, which is expressed in the dorsal half.
as a result, margin-specific genes like cut are expressed in a stripe of cells along the dv border, in a notch-dependent manner  <cit> .
to test if this process requires daux, wild-type and dauxf956* mosaic wing discs were stained with 2b <dig> α-cut antibody  <cit> .
in wild-type wing discs, a stripe of cut-positive cells was seen along the dv border .
in contrast, cut staining was absent in dauxf956* mutant clones located at the dv border , suggesting that daux is required for the dv boundary formation in wing development.
again, at a higher magnification , some dauxf956* mutant cells at the clone border still expressed cut, supporting the possibility that daux functions non-cell-autonomously during notch signaling .
daux acts non-cell-autonomously during notch signaling
to determine in which cell daux is required during notch signaling, eye discs containing flp-induced dauxf956* mutant clones were stained for enhancer of split ), a transcriptional target of notch signaling  <cit> .
we reasoned that, if daux functions in the receiving cells , all mutant cells, regardless of their locations within the clones, will be unable to activate notch and will, therefore, not express e. on the other hand, if daux functions in the signaling cells , mutant cells at the clone border can still receive signals from neighboring wild-type cells, and will express e. consistent with this reasoning, none of the cells mutant for notch receptor  within the clones expressed e   <cit> .
conversely, as dl is one of the ligands of this signaling cascade, several dlrevf <dig> mutant cells at the clone border expressed e   <cit> .
similarly, some dauxf956* mutant cells at the clone border clearly expressed e .
this, along with the observations described in previous sections regarding ato and cut expression, suggests that, like dl, daux is required in the signaling cells in the notch cascade.
mutations in daux cause dl accumulation at the cell surface
as our genetic data suggest that daux functions in the signaling cells during notch signaling, a relevant cargo of daux-dependent endocytosis is likely to be notch ligand.
to test this, flp-induced mutant clones of dauxl78h and dauxf956* were first stained with c <dig> b α-dl antibody, which recognizes the extracellular domain of dl  <cit> .
compared to the wild-type cells, the intensity of dl staining was increased in both dauxf956* and dauxl78h mutant cells .
this increase of dl staining intensity was more pronounced when the clones were at or near the morphogenetic furrows, consistent with the phenotype shown by a mutation in the pten-related region  <cit> .
although this elevated level of dl seemed to accumulate around daux mutant cell periphery , it was not clear whether dl proteins were trapped at the plasma membrane or in vesicular structures inside the cells.
to distinguish between these possibilities, eye discs containing dauxf956* mutant clones were stained with c <dig> b under a non-permeabilized condition to label dl at the cell surface.
in wild-type tissues, a high level of surface dl staining was first seen in cells behind the morphogenetic furrow .
in more mature clusters located in the posterior region of the eye disc, less dl was seen at the surface, suggesting that most of dl was internalized  <cit> .
in dauxf956* mutant clones, the surface dl staining appeared excessive, indicating that the previously observed peripheral dl most likely represents dl accumulated at the cell surface.
internalization of egfr and notch appear disrupted in daux mutant cells
knockdown of gak function in mammalian cells was shown to greatly inhibit the internalization of egfr  <cit> .
to determine whether the endocytic function of daux is specific to notch ligand, flp-induced dauxf956* mutant eye disc clones were stained with a α-der antibody  <cit>  and a α-notch antibody   <cit> , respectively.
in wild-type eye discs, der is expressed in cells ahead of furrow, and its expression is reduced behind the furrow  <cit> .
compared to wild-type cells, der staining is elevated in the mutant cells , suggesting that the internalization of der was inhibited.
similarly, the intensity of notch staining was increased in dauxf956* mutant cells .
thus, although our genetic data suggest that daux is required in the signaling cells during notch signaling, the endocytic function of daux is not limited to the notch ligand.
clathrin distribution was disrupted in daux mutant clones
we have previously observed a genetic interaction between daux and clathrin light chain   <cit> .
to test directly whether clathrin distribution was disrupted by daux, the localization of a clc-gfp fusion  <cit>  was examined in flp-induced daux mutant clones in eye discs.
in wild-type cells , clc-gfp appeared as vesicular structures near the cell periphery .
in both dauxl78h and dauxf956* mutant cells , vesicular clc-gfp still appeared near cell periphery but its intensity was clearly elevated .
furthermore, large and bright spots of clc-gfp staining could be seen , suggesting that clc-gfp or clc-positive structures may form aggregates in daux mutant cells.
these data suggest that normal clathrin distribution depends on both the kinase and the j-domain of daux.
interestingly, although the level of dl proteins appeared elevated, staining of clc-gfp- expressing dauxf956* mutant cells with c <dig> b α-dl antibody showed that dl was not enriched in these large clc-positive structures .
the cbm and j-domains are indispensable for daux function in notch signaling
to investigate the domains critical for daux function, we generated a series of mrfp-tagged daux derivatives, each with a particular domain or a subset of domains removed .
these include uas-dauxfl-mrfp , uas-dauxΔk-mrfp , uas-dauxcj-mrfp , uas-dauxΔc-mrfp  and uas-dauxΔj-mrfp .
using a α-dsred antibody  and the act5c-gal <dig> driver, bands of expected sizes were detected in blots of extracts prepared from these transgenic flies , indicating that these truncated daux proteins were expressed.
to investigate the functional relevance of various daux domains during notch signaling, the abilities of these deletions, expressed using the act5c-gal <dig> driver, to rescue the supernumerary photoreceptor phenotype exhibited by daux mutant eye discs were determined.
while act5c-gal <dig> or uas-daux-mrfp constructs  alone had no effect, expression of dauxfl-mrfp completely suppressed the disorganization and the extra elav-positive cell defects in flp-induced dauxf956* clones .
similarly, expression of dauxΔk-mrfp or dauxcj-mrfp in dauxf956*clones displayed arrays of normal complement of elav-positive cells, suggesting that over-expression of daux without its kinase domain and the pten-related region can restore normal notch signaling .
in addition, it should be noted that expression of dauxfl, dauxΔk or dauxcj could rescue daux mutants to adult viability .
in contrast, expression of dauxΔc-mrfp and dauxΔj-mrfp could not rescue the extra elav-positive cell defects in dauxf956* clones .
over-expression of dauxΔj-mrfp appeared to have some dominant negative effects.
for instance, animals mutant for dauxl78h/dauxw328* died during the larval stage.
however, these mutants died before the larval stage when the j-domain deletion was expressed under the control of act5c-gal <dig> .
the results of these rescue experiments were confirmed using two independent transgenic lines from each construct and held true for another daux allele , indicating that it is not allele specific.
together, these results suggest that while the kinase and pten-related domains are less critical, the j-domain and the cbm region are essential for daux function.
discussion
from a f <dig> non-complementation screen, we have isolated several new daux alleles, some of which contain point mutations disrupting specific domains.
consistent with our previous analysis of a viable daux allele, strong daux mutations affect several notch-mediated processes, including photoreceptor specification in the eye and dv boundary formation in the wing.
these phenotypes are consistent with the genetic interactions exhibited between daux and notch  <cit>  and between daux and lqf  <cit> .
taken together, these genetic observations strengthen the notion that endocytosis plays a critical role in notch signaling, and suggest that daux functions in multiple notch-dependent events.
as the functional importance of endocytosis has been suggested for both the signaling and receiving cells during notch signaling  <cit> , it is critical to determine in which cell is daux function required.
although we have previously concluded that daux is needed in the signaling cells, the evidence, obtained from mitotic clones of a weak daux allele, was less than convincing  <cit> .
to adequately address this critical issue, we have monitored the expression of e, a notch target gene, in clones mutant for strong daux alleles.
using these reagents, it is clear that daux mutant cells at the clone border can still activate notch , suggesting daux acts non-cell autonomously.
these genetic data imply that the relevant cargo is likely to be the notch ligand.
indeed, as shown by the surface labeling experiment, dl internalization is disrupted in daux mutant cells.
inhibition of auxilin function by mutations  <cit> , rnai  <cit> , or injection of inhibitory peptides  <cit>  is known to interfere with the endocytosis of many molecules.
in mammalian cells, inhibition of gak function causes a decrease in the internalization of egfr and transferrin  <cit> .
our observation suggests that, similar to the mammalian cells, daux participates in the endocytosis of egfr, although we did not previously observe a genetic interaction between der and daux  <cit> .
it is possible that this lack of interaction between daux and der reflects the low sensitivity of our genetic assay.
alternatively, it may be that a defect in der internalization does not significantly impact its signaling during eye development.
consistent with this, we have been unable to detect a drastic increase in the phosphorylation of map kinase, a downstream event of der activation, in dauxf956* mutant clones .
nevertheless, our data show that, although the developmental defects of daux resemble those of notch, notch ligand is not the sole cargo of auxilin-mediated endocytosis.
this apparent specificity of daux's notch-like phenotypes suggests that the notch pathway, compared to other signaling cascades, may be more sensitive to disruptions in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
sequencing analysis of our daux alleles revealed that disruptions in the kinase, the pten-related region, and the j-domain could all result in abnormal notch signaling.
noticeably, our screen did not isolate any point mutation in cbm, although the deletion analysis suggests that the cbm is critical for daux function.
this apparent discrepancy is likely due to the fact that the cbm domain contains multiple redundant clathrin-binding motifs  <cit> , thereby obscuring the effect of eliminating one single motif by a point mutation.
interestingly, the removal of the cbm from the yeast auxilin  does not completely eliminate its function in vivo  <cit> .
the reason for this difference is unclear but it is possible that swa- <dig> contains other protein domains capable of substituting for the cbm.
similar to a study of the mammalian gak  <cit> , our deletion analysis confirmed the importance of the j-domain, as over-expression of the dauxΔj construct fails to restore the extra photoreceptor cell defect.
the cbm and j domains are thought to facilitate the recruitment of hsc <dig> to ccvs, and a fragment consisting of cbm and j domain alone has been shown to support clathrin uncoating in vitro  <cit> .
in support of this notion that the recruitment of hsc <dig> to ccvs is likely to be a critical step, over-expression of the cbm and j domain alone could restore the supernumerary elav-positive cell phenotype.
conversely, our observation also implies that the loss of the kinase and pten-related region could be compensated by the over-expression of the cbm and j-domain.
the pten-related region is thought to participate in the membrane recruitment of auxilin during cme  <cit> .
thus it is imaginable that a defect in the subcellular localization is less deleterious when the fragment consisting of cbm and j-domain is over-expressed.
it is unclear how the requirement of kinase domain can be compensated by the over-expression of the cbm and j-domain, as the relevant substrate for daux kinase domain during notch signaling is not known.
it should be mentioned that elevated expression of dauxcj rescued the extra elav-positive cell phenotype in both dauxf956* and dauxl78h , arguing against a scenario in which the kinase domain of endogenous dauxf956* mutant proteins could complement the over-expressed dauxcj in trans.
it is possible that some functional redundancy exists between daux and numb-associated kinase   <cit> , as the kinase domains from both factors are known to phosphorylate adaptor complexes  <cit> .
however, although mutations in subunits of drosophila ap <dig> and ap <dig> complexes have been implicated in other notch-dependent processes  <cit> , it is not clear if these adaptor complexes have a role in the notch processes we examined.
homozygous α -adaptin mutants do not appear to exhibit a neurogenic phenotype  <cit> .
furthermore, the removal of one copy of ap <dig> μ subunit  has no effect on the dauxi670k rough eye phenotype .
in any case, it should be stressed that the kinase and the pten-related region do play a role in notch signaling, as point mutations disrupting these domains cause notch-like defects, albeit to a weaker extent.
taken together, these results suggest the role of the kinase and the pten-related region during notch ligand endocytosis is less than obligatory.
what is the role of ligand endocytosis in notch signaling?
it has been suggested that, after receptor-ligand binding, ligand endocytosis may provide a mechanical stress or other types of micro-environment  to facilitate notch cleavage or necd shedding  <cit> .
alternatively, before binding to notch, the ligands may have to enter a particular recycling pathway to render them active  <cit> .
we initially viewed the linking of daux to notch as evidence favoring the latter model because it suggests that ligand endocytosis needs to proceed past clathrin uncoating.
however, as an increased level of the dl appeared to be trapped at the mutant cell surface, not inside ccvs, the linking of daux to notch certainly does not exclude the model that ligand internalization per se is critical for notch signaling.
biochemical analysis has suggested several additional functions for auxilin during the ccv cycle besides uncoating  <cit> .
although abnormal clathrin distribution was observed in daux cells, given the resolution of our analysis, it is unclear which particular step were affected.
it is possible that mutations in daux directly inhibit notch ligand endocytosis by disrupting one or more of these early steps during ccv formation.
alternatively, daux mutations may indirectly inhibit notch ligand internalization by causing an excessive formation of non-functional clathrin-dependent structures, thereby decreasing the cytosolic clathrin pool.
indeed, in daux mutant cells, those large clathrin-positive structures did not appear to contain an elevated level of dl.
consistent with this, it was recently shown that over-expression of chc could restore the daux-associated defects  <cit> .
CONCLUSIONS
our genetic analysis of strong daux alleles clearly strengthens the notion that ligand endocytosis plays a critical role in notch signaling.
furthermore, the deletion analysis suggests that the recruitment of hsc <dig> to clathrin is a key event for daux to facilitate notch signaling.
more importantly, we showed that dl accumulates at the cell surface in daux mutant cells.
this suggests that the linking of daux to the notch pathway does not exclude the model in which ligand endocytosis activates notch by physically dissociating the receptor.
",872,"BACKGROUND
the notch pathway, a highly conserved signaling module, participates in diverse aspects of animal development, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and pattern formation  <cit> . upon ligand binding, notch undergoes proteolytic processing, resulting in the release and the nuclear translocation of nicd  for transcriptional activation  <cit> . as the notch receptor and its ligands are widely expressed, the activities of this important pathway need to be regulated at multiple levels to prevent inappropriate signaling output. recent evidence from several systems has suggested that ligand endocytosis plays a key role in regulating the activity of this cascade, although its exact function in notch signaling remains unclear.

genetic analysis using drosophila has identified several factors required for ligand endocytosis during notch signaling. in drosophila, there are two known notch ligands, delta  and serrate , both of which appear to utilize an ubiquitin-mediated endocytic pathway to activate notch  <cit> . while polyubiquitination is known to facilitate protein degradation, covalent addition of a single ubiquitin moiety to the cytoplasmic tails of membrane proteins can serve as an internalization signal  <cit> . the ubiquitination of dl and ser for internalization is mediated by neuralized  and mind bomb , two structurally unrelated but functionally similar e <dig> ubiquitin ligases  <cit> . the subsequent recruitment of ubiquitinated notch ligands into clathrin-coated vesicles is thought to depend on liquid facets , a cargo-specific clathrin adaptor  <cit> . dynamin, a gtpase required for the pinching-off of clathrin-coated vesicles  from the plasma membrane, is also required for this event  <cit> . moreover, during the asymmetric cell division of sensory organ precursors, rab <dig>  and sec <dig>  have been shown to promote notch signaling and regulate dl trafficking  <cit> .

mutations in drosophila auxilin , a j-domain-containing regulator in clathrin-mediated transport, were recently shown to disrupt notch-dependent processes  <cit> . although originally identified as a factor promoting the assembly of clathrin cage from free triskelia  <cit> , efforts investigating the role of auxilin during clathrin-mediated endocytosis  have mostly focused on its cooperation with hsc <dig> in mediating the disassembly of clathrin coats form nascent ccvs  <cit> . in mammals, there are two different auxilin-like molecules , differing in their tissue distributions and the presence of a n-terminal ark family kinase domain  <cit> . in contrast, the drosophila genome contains only one auxilin ortholog, which is structurally more similar to gak, as it contains a n-terminal kinase domain, followed by a pten  homologous region, a clathrin-binding domain, and a c-terminal dnaj domain   <cit> . biochemical data suggest that the cbm  and j-domain recruit atp-bound hsc <dig> to ccvs and stimulate the atpase activity of hsc <dig>  which drive the disassembly of clathrin coats  <cit> . the pten-related region appears to be critical for the membrane recruitment of auxilin to clathrin-rich regions  <cit> . the n-terminal kinase is known to phosphorylate subunits of ap <dig> and ap <dig> adaptor complexes, possibly modulating the affinity of these adaptors for cargoes  <cit> . however, as not all auxilin homologs  contain the kinase and the pten-related region  <cit> , the physiological relevance of these domains remains to be determined.

initially, the identification of auxilin as a component of the drosophila notch pathway suggests that, to activate notch, ligand endocytosis needs to proceed past the step of clathrin cage disassembly. this implies that the relevance of ligand endocytosis is not the internalization per se, but a transit of ligand through subsequent endocytic compartments. however, this interpretation hinges on the assumption that auxilin participates solely in clathrin uncoating under physiological conditions. recent in vitro investigations have suggested several new functions of auxilin during cme  <cit> , including facilitating clathrin exchange during ccv formation  <cit> , binding to adaptor complexes  <cit> , binding to dynamin to facilitate the constriction of coated pits  <cit> , and chaperoning dissociated clathrin for subsequent rounds of endocytosis  <cit> . thus, to understand the significance of ligand endocytosis in notch, it is critical to determine whether daux is exclusively involved in clathrin uncoating or has additional roles during cme under physiological conditions.

using strong daux alleles generated from an frt-containing chromosome, we have obtained compelling evidences that daux mutations cause defects in multiple notch-dependent processes and daux function is required in the signaling cells. although the relevant cargo for daux during notch signaling seems to be dl, the endocytic function of daux is not limited to the notch ligand, as the internalizations of other membrane proteins also appear disrupted. deletion analysis shows that over-expressed cbm and j-domain are sufficient for daux function, suggesting that the recruitment of hsc <dig> to ccvs is a core function of daux. furthermore, while the disruption of daux function alters the sub-cellular clathrin distribution, dl appears to be trapped at the cell surface, away from the abnormal clathrin-positive structures. together, our data support a model, in which daux facilitates notch ligand endocytosis by regulating clathrin dynamics. moreover, the fact that dl is trapped at the plasma membrane in daux mutants suggests that the linking of daux to the notch pathway does not exclude the possibility that the notch ligand internalization per se plays a pivotal role in activating notch.

RESULTS
mutations in daux kinase- or j-domains disrupt photoreceptor specification
to further understand the role of daux under physiological conditions, we have isolated additional daux mutations from several rounds of f <dig> non-complementation screens. we have nine mutations in daux, and, for eight of these nine alleles, the molecular lesions are known . furthermore, three of these alleles, namely dauxl78h, dauxf956*, and dauxg257e, were generated from an frt-containing chromosome; thus permitting daux phenotypic analysis in clones.

to assess the strength of these daux alleles, the lethal phases of animals carrying these daux mutations over dfed <dig>  a deletion  that removes the entire daux locus, were determined. five of these alleles , when trans-heterozygous with the deletion, died prior to the larval stage. three of them, dauxs214*, dauxw254*, and dauxw328*, all contain nonsense mutations within the n-terminal kinase domain, suggesting that they are strong or null alleles. the early lethal phase of dauxf956* and dauxw1150*, two nonsense mutations near the c-terminus, most likely reflects the importance of the j-domain in daux function. this analysis indicated that dauxl78h and dauxg257e, two missense mutations disrupting highly conserved residues in the sub-domain ii and ix of the n-terminal kinase domain  <cit>  respectively, are weaker alleles. thus, the allele series, in descending allelic strength, can be described as: s214*≈w254*≈w328* > f956*≈w1150* > l78h≈g257e > i670k .

previous studies have shown that mutations in the pten-related region cause defects in photoreceptor specification  <cit> . to test whether mutations in other daux domains have similar effects, flp-induced mutant clones of dauxl78h and dauxf956*, mutations disrupting the kinase and the j-domain respectively, were stained with α-elav, which labels the nuclei of neuronal cells  <cit> . in wild-type tissues, an organized set of eight elav-positive cells is formed in each cluster. in contrast, as shown in figure 1b–e, increased numbers of disorganized elav-positive cells were seen in both dauxl78h and dauxf956* mutant clones . this suggests that the integrity of the kinase and the j-domain, in addition to the pten-related region, is important for the function of daux during neuronal cell specification. in addition, this neural hypertrophy exhibited by dauxf956* tissues seemed to be more severe than those of dauxl78h , correlating well with the allelic strength defined by the lethal phase analysis.

notch-dependent proneural enhancement and lateral inhibition are both disrupted in daux mutant tissues
the drosophila compound eye consists of regular arrays of ~ <dig> ommatidia, each containing eight stereotypically positioned photoreceptors  and other accessory cells. the formation of this elaborate pattern is initiated in the larval eye imaginal disc along the morphogenetic furrow , which sweeps from posterior to anterior across the eye disc  <cit> . behind the furrow, undifferentiated cells are sequentially recruited to adopt distinct developmental fates. to further understand the roles of daux in photoreceptor cell differentiation, we investigated the effect of daux mutations on the specification of r <dig>  the founder cell within each cluster. the specification of r <dig> cells is known to require at least two notch-dependent events: 1) proneural enhancement: an up-regulation of atonal   <cit>  expression in cells near the morphogenetic furrow to confer them the capability to adopt a neuronal fate, and 2) lateral inhibition: a subsequent restriction of the broad ato expression to one single r <dig> cell per cluster behind the mf  <cit> .

to determine if daux is required for these processes, mosaic eye discs containing dauxf956* mutant clones were stained for ato. as shown in figure 2a, most dauxf956* mutant cells located near the mf expressed less ato than their wild-type counterpart, suggesting that daux has a role in the proneural enhancement event. noticeably, some dauxf956* mutant cells at the clone border still expressed an elevated level of ato . one plausible explanation is that daux functions non-cell-autonomously during notch signaling ; therefore, the notch pathway in these dauxf956* mutant cells could still be activated because they were juxtaposed to the wild-type cells.

behind the mf in normal eye discs, the broad ato expression is gradually restricted, by notch-mediated lateral inhibition, to a single cell in each cluster. unlike wild type, dauxf956* mutant tissues contained clumps of multiple ato-positive cells that are not restricted into single ato-expressing cells , suggesting that the process of restricting ato expression was disrupted. to further confirm that lateral inhibition during r <dig> specification was affected by daux, flp-induced eye disc clones were stained for senseless , a zn finger-containing transcription factor expressed in the nuclei of r <dig> cells  <cit> . unlike ato, whose expression disappears in more mature r <dig> cells, sens expression persists in all r <dig> cells in the eye disc  <cit> . similar to the ato staining, clusters of extra sens-positive nuclei were seen in dauxf956* mutant tissues after the furrow . together, these observations suggest that both proneural enhancement and lateral inhibition, two known notch-dependent processes, require daux.

mutations in daux disrupt the formation of the dorsal-ventral wing boundary
to ask if daux regulates other notch-dependent processes, we examined the effect of daux mutations on the formation of the dorsal-ventral  boundary in the developing wing discs. in normal wing discs, cells in both the dorsal and ventral compartments express notch. however, because of the modification of notch receptor by fringe in the dorsal compartment  <cit> , these dorsal cells respond preferentially to dl signaling from cells in the ventral compartment. conversely, the cells in the ventral half respond preferentially to the other notch ligand, ser, which is expressed in the dorsal half. as a result, margin-specific genes like cut are expressed in a stripe of cells along the dv border, in a notch-dependent manner  <cit> .

to test if this process requires daux, wild-type and dauxf956* mosaic wing discs were stained with 2b <dig> α-cut antibody  <cit> . in wild-type wing discs, a stripe of cut-positive cells was seen along the dv border . in contrast, cut staining was absent in dauxf956* mutant clones located at the dv border , suggesting that daux is required for the dv boundary formation in wing development. again, at a higher magnification , some dauxf956* mutant cells at the clone border still expressed cut, supporting the possibility that daux functions non-cell-autonomously during notch signaling .

daux acts non-cell-autonomously during notch signaling
to determine in which cell daux is required during notch signaling, eye discs containing flp-induced dauxf956* mutant clones were stained for enhancer of split ), a transcriptional target of notch signaling  <cit> . we reasoned that, if daux functions in the receiving cells , all mutant cells, regardless of their locations within the clones, will be unable to activate notch and will, therefore, not express e. on the other hand, if daux functions in the signaling cells , mutant cells at the clone border can still receive signals from neighboring wild-type cells, and will express e. consistent with this reasoning, none of the cells mutant for notch receptor  within the clones expressed e   <cit> . conversely, as dl is one of the ligands of this signaling cascade, several dlrevf <dig> mutant cells at the clone border expressed e   <cit> . similarly, some dauxf956* mutant cells at the clone border clearly expressed e . this, along with the observations described in previous sections regarding ato and cut expression, suggests that, like dl, daux is required in the signaling cells in the notch cascade.

mutations in daux cause dl accumulation at the cell surface
as our genetic data suggest that daux functions in the signaling cells during notch signaling, a relevant cargo of daux-dependent endocytosis is likely to be notch ligand. to test this, flp-induced mutant clones of dauxl78h and dauxf956* were first stained with c <dig> b α-dl antibody, which recognizes the extracellular domain of dl  <cit> . compared to the wild-type cells, the intensity of dl staining was increased in both dauxf956* and dauxl78h mutant cells . this increase of dl staining intensity was more pronounced when the clones were at or near the morphogenetic furrows, consistent with the phenotype shown by a mutation in the pten-related region  <cit> .

although this elevated level of dl seemed to accumulate around daux mutant cell periphery , it was not clear whether dl proteins were trapped at the plasma membrane or in vesicular structures inside the cells. to distinguish between these possibilities, eye discs containing dauxf956* mutant clones were stained with c <dig> b under a non-permeabilized condition to label dl at the cell surface. in wild-type tissues, a high level of surface dl staining was first seen in cells behind the morphogenetic furrow . in more mature clusters located in the posterior region of the eye disc, less dl was seen at the surface, suggesting that most of dl was internalized  <cit> . in dauxf956* mutant clones, the surface dl staining appeared excessive, indicating that the previously observed peripheral dl most likely represents dl accumulated at the cell surface.

internalization of egfr and notch appear disrupted in daux mutant cells
knockdown of gak function in mammalian cells was shown to greatly inhibit the internalization of egfr  <cit> . to determine whether the endocytic function of daux is specific to notch ligand, flp-induced dauxf956* mutant eye disc clones were stained with a α-der antibody  <cit>  and a α-notch antibody   <cit> , respectively. in wild-type eye discs, der is expressed in cells ahead of furrow, and its expression is reduced behind the furrow  <cit> . compared to wild-type cells, der staining is elevated in the mutant cells , suggesting that the internalization of der was inhibited. similarly, the intensity of notch staining was increased in dauxf956* mutant cells . thus, although our genetic data suggest that daux is required in the signaling cells during notch signaling, the endocytic function of daux is not limited to the notch ligand.

clathrin distribution was disrupted in daux mutant clones
we have previously observed a genetic interaction between daux and clathrin light chain   <cit> . to test directly whether clathrin distribution was disrupted by daux, the localization of a clc-gfp fusion  <cit>  was examined in flp-induced daux mutant clones in eye discs. in wild-type cells , clc-gfp appeared as vesicular structures near the cell periphery . in both dauxl78h and dauxf956* mutant cells , vesicular clc-gfp still appeared near cell periphery but its intensity was clearly elevated . furthermore, large and bright spots of clc-gfp staining could be seen , suggesting that clc-gfp or clc-positive structures may form aggregates in daux mutant cells. these data suggest that normal clathrin distribution depends on both the kinase and the j-domain of daux. interestingly, although the level of dl proteins appeared elevated, staining of clc-gfp- expressing dauxf956* mutant cells with c <dig> b α-dl antibody showed that dl was not enriched in these large clc-positive structures .

the cbm and j-domains are indispensable for daux function in notch signaling
to investigate the domains critical for daux function, we generated a series of mrfp-tagged daux derivatives, each with a particular domain or a subset of domains removed . these include uas-dauxfl-mrfp , uas-dauxΔk-mrfp , uas-dauxcj-mrfp , uas-dauxΔc-mrfp  and uas-dauxΔj-mrfp . using a α-dsred antibody  and the act5c-gal <dig> driver, bands of expected sizes were detected in blots of extracts prepared from these transgenic flies , indicating that these truncated daux proteins were expressed.

to investigate the functional relevance of various daux domains during notch signaling, the abilities of these deletions, expressed using the act5c-gal <dig> driver, to rescue the supernumerary photoreceptor phenotype exhibited by daux mutant eye discs were determined. while act5c-gal <dig> or uas-daux-mrfp constructs  alone had no effect, expression of dauxfl-mrfp completely suppressed the disorganization and the extra elav-positive cell defects in flp-induced dauxf956* clones . similarly, expression of dauxΔk-mrfp or dauxcj-mrfp in dauxf956*clones displayed arrays of normal complement of elav-positive cells, suggesting that over-expression of daux without its kinase domain and the pten-related region can restore normal notch signaling . in addition, it should be noted that expression of dauxfl, dauxΔk or dauxcj could rescue daux mutants to adult viability . in contrast, expression of dauxΔc-mrfp and dauxΔj-mrfp could not rescue the extra elav-positive cell defects in dauxf956* clones . over-expression of dauxΔj-mrfp appeared to have some dominant negative effects. for instance, animals mutant for dauxl78h/dauxw328* died during the larval stage. however, these mutants died before the larval stage when the j-domain deletion was expressed under the control of act5c-gal <dig> . the results of these rescue experiments were confirmed using two independent transgenic lines from each construct and held true for another daux allele , indicating that it is not allele specific. together, these results suggest that while the kinase and pten-related domains are less critical, the j-domain and the cbm region are essential for daux function.

inhibition of auxilin function by mutations  <cit> , rnai  <cit> , or injection of inhibitory peptides  <cit>  is known to interfere with the endocytosis of many molecules. in mammalian cells, inhibition of gak function causes a decrease in the internalization of egfr and transferrin  <cit> . our observation suggests that, similar to the mammalian cells, daux participates in the endocytosis of egfr, although we did not previously observe a genetic interaction between der and daux  <cit> . it is possible that this lack of interaction between daux and der reflects the low sensitivity of our genetic assay. alternatively, it may be that a defect in der internalization does not significantly impact its signaling during eye development. consistent with this, we have been unable to detect a drastic increase in the phosphorylation of map kinase, a downstream event of der activation, in dauxf956* mutant clones . nevertheless, our data show that, although the developmental defects of daux resemble those of notch, notch ligand is not the sole cargo of auxilin-mediated endocytosis. this apparent specificity of daux's notch-like phenotypes suggests that the notch pathway, compared to other signaling cascades, may be more sensitive to disruptions in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

sequencing analysis of our daux alleles revealed that disruptions in the kinase, the pten-related region, and the j-domain could all result in abnormal notch signaling. noticeably, our screen did not isolate any point mutation in cbm, although the deletion analysis suggests that the cbm is critical for daux function. this apparent discrepancy is likely due to the fact that the cbm domain contains multiple redundant clathrin-binding motifs  <cit> , thereby obscuring the effect of eliminating one single motif by a point mutation. interestingly, the removal of the cbm from the yeast auxilin  does not completely eliminate its function in vivo  <cit> . the reason for this difference is unclear but it is possible that swa- <dig> contains other protein domains capable of substituting for the cbm. similar to a study of the mammalian gak  <cit> , our deletion analysis confirmed the importance of the j-domain, as over-expression of the dauxΔj construct fails to restore the extra photoreceptor cell defect. the cbm and j domains are thought to facilitate the recruitment of hsc <dig> to ccvs, and a fragment consisting of cbm and j domain alone has been shown to support clathrin uncoating in vitro  <cit> . in support of this notion that the recruitment of hsc <dig> to ccvs is likely to be a critical step, over-expression of the cbm and j domain alone could restore the supernumerary elav-positive cell phenotype.

conversely, our observation also implies that the loss of the kinase and pten-related region could be compensated by the over-expression of the cbm and j-domain. the pten-related region is thought to participate in the membrane recruitment of auxilin during cme  <cit> . thus it is imaginable that a defect in the subcellular localization is less deleterious when the fragment consisting of cbm and j-domain is over-expressed. it is unclear how the requirement of kinase domain can be compensated by the over-expression of the cbm and j-domain, as the relevant substrate for daux kinase domain during notch signaling is not known. it should be mentioned that elevated expression of dauxcj rescued the extra elav-positive cell phenotype in both dauxf956* and dauxl78h , arguing against a scenario in which the kinase domain of endogenous dauxf956* mutant proteins could complement the over-expressed dauxcj in trans. it is possible that some functional redundancy exists between daux and numb-associated kinase   <cit> , as the kinase domains from both factors are known to phosphorylate adaptor complexes  <cit> . however, although mutations in subunits of drosophila ap <dig> and ap <dig> complexes have been implicated in other notch-dependent processes  <cit> , it is not clear if these adaptor complexes have a role in the notch processes we examined. homozygous α -adaptin mutants do not appear to exhibit a neurogenic phenotype  <cit> . furthermore, the removal of one copy of ap <dig> μ subunit  has no effect on the dauxi670k rough eye phenotype . in any case, it should be stressed that the kinase and the pten-related region do play a role in notch signaling, as point mutations disrupting these domains cause notch-like defects, albeit to a weaker extent. taken together, these results suggest the role of the kinase and the pten-related region during notch ligand endocytosis is less than obligatory.

what is the role of ligand endocytosis in notch signaling? it has been suggested that, after receptor-ligand binding, ligand endocytosis may provide a mechanical stress or other types of micro-environment  to facilitate notch cleavage or necd shedding  <cit> . alternatively, before binding to notch, the ligands may have to enter a particular recycling pathway to render them active  <cit> . we initially viewed the linking of daux to notch as evidence favoring the latter model because it suggests that ligand endocytosis needs to proceed past clathrin uncoating. however, as an increased level of the dl appeared to be trapped at the mutant cell surface, not inside ccvs, the linking of daux to notch certainly does not exclude the model that ligand internalization per se is critical for notch signaling. biochemical analysis has suggested several additional functions for auxilin during the ccv cycle besides uncoating  <cit> . although abnormal clathrin distribution was observed in daux cells, given the resolution of our analysis, it is unclear which particular step were affected. it is possible that mutations in daux directly inhibit notch ligand endocytosis by disrupting one or more of these early steps during ccv formation. alternatively, daux mutations may indirectly inhibit notch ligand internalization by causing an excessive formation of non-functional clathrin-dependent structures, thereby decreasing the cytosolic clathrin pool. indeed, in daux mutant cells, those large clathrin-positive structures did not appear to contain an elevated level of dl. consistent with this, it was recently shown that over-expression of chc could restore the daux-associated defects  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our genetic analysis of strong daux alleles clearly strengthens the notion that ligand endocytosis plays a critical role in notch signaling. furthermore, the deletion analysis suggests that the recruitment of hsc <dig> to clathrin is a key event for daux to facilitate notch signaling. more importantly, we showed that dl accumulates at the cell surface in daux mutant cells. this suggests that the linking of daux to the notch pathway does not exclude the model in which ligand endocytosis activates notch by physically dissociating the receptor.

","our data suggest that daux mutations inhibit notch ligand internalization at an early step during clathrin-mediated endocytosis, before the disassembly of clathrin-coated vesicles.
together, our observations argue that ligand endocytosis is critical for notch signaling and auxilin participates in notch signaling by facilitating ligand internalization.
ligand endocytosis plays a critical role in regulating the activity of the notch pathway.
in agreement with previous work, analysis using these stronger daux alleles shows that daux is required for several notch-dependent processes, and its function during notch signaling is required in the signaling cells.
to understand the role of auxilin in notch ligand endocytosis, we have analyzed several point mutations affecting specific domains of daux.
further, the inhibition of ligand endocytosis in daux mutant cells possibly occurs due to depletion of cytosolic pools of clathrin via the formation of clathrin aggregates.
however, surface labeling experiment shows that, in daux mutant cells, delta accumulates at the cell surface.
in daux mutant cells, clathrin appears to form large aggregates, although delta is not enriched in these aberrant clathrin-positive structures.
deletion analysis shows that the clathrin-binding motif and the j-domain, when over-expressed, are sufficient for rescuing daux phenotypes, implying that the recruitment of hsc <dig> to clathrin is a critical role for daux.
in support of the genetic evidences, the level of delta appears elevated in daux deficient cells, suggesting that the endocytosis of notch ligand is disrupted.
","BACKGROUND
ligand endocytosis plays a critical role in regulating the activity of the notch pathway. the drosophila homolog of auxilin , a j-domain-containing protein best known for its role in the disassembly of clathrin coats from clathrin-coated vesicles, has recently been implicated in notch signaling, although its exact mechanism remains poorly understood.

"BACKGROUND
in uganda pig farming is an increasingly popular source of livelihoods  <cit>  and the population of pigs has increased from  <dig>  million in  <dig> to  <dig>  million  <dig>  <cit> .
there is a deliberate effort by the government of uganda to encourage pig farming in poor rural communities throughprograms like national agricultural advisory services .
the popularity of pig farming is partially due to the ability of farmers to keep pigs under minimal input systems, allowing pigs to range freely, thereby exploiting the scavenging nature of the animals to feed them cheaply.
despite the economic opportunities which these low-input systems provide, pigs that are kept under a free range system are at high risk of acquiring a range of diseases.
these diseases can either be production limiting, such as the helminths ascaris suis and trichuris suis  <cit>  or the highly pathogenic virus causing african swine fever  <cit> , or have serious public health consequences, such as trichenellosis  <cit> , toxoplasmosis  <cit>  and, of specific interest to this study, cysticercosis caused by the zoonotic helminth taenia solium  <cit> .
cysticercus cellulosae is the larval stage of t. solium found in the pig.
the infection is contracted by pig when they either ingest human faeces containing infective eggs, or when feeding on pasture contaminated with t. solium eggs  <cit> .
in people who consume raw or inadequately cooked pork from infected animals, the larval cysts can develop into the adult stage tapeworm in their intestine, an infection known as taeniasis.
gravid proglottids containing infective eggs detach from the adult tapeworm and are excreted in the faeces in an intermittent fashion  <cit> .
in areas where open defecation is common, the feacal material containing these infective eggs are again accessible for consumption by pigs and the life-cycle is perpetuated  <cit> .
humans can also act as an aberrant intermediate host for t. solium if there is faecal-oral contamination with the infective eggs.
in such cases the larval stage can be found in human muscle, eye or central nervous system causing human cysticercosis  <cit> .
the most serious form of human cysticercosis is when the larval form develops in the brain, a condition called neurocysticercosis.
neurocysticercosis is major cause of adulthood acquired epilepsy  <cit> , making t. solium a great public health risk in endemic communities  <cit> .
key risk factors for porcine cysticercosis are present in the lake kyoga basin, a region of central uganda supporting a significant rural population, as well as providing a source of food to more densely populated urban communities.
the majority of pig farmers in the region keep their pigs at free range  <cit> .
open defecation is highly prevalent, with a previous study observing that  <dig> % of the households do not have latrines and those with latrines often do not use them  <cit> .
many pigs from free-range production systems are not taken to the formal slaughter facilities where meat inspection can be carried out  <cit> .
pigs are often slaughtered in unhygienic conditions, in the open air, with slaughter men wearing no protective clothing and no cleaning of the slaughter instrument .
similar poor slaughter conditions have been reported in neighboring kenya  <cit> .
researchers who were carrying out a study on onchocerciasis in moyo district in northern uganda, found that some skin nodules of human patients, suspected to be onchocerciasis were due to human cysticercosis on the skin  <cit> .
this indicates to us that there is great need for more information about the prevalence of the disease in the pig keeping areas of the country.
lingual palpation has already been utilized to determine the prevalence of cysticercosis in this study site  <cit>  found to range up to  <dig> % in some sub-counties.
since it is known that lingual inspection is not sensitive in very light infections  <cit> , it is possible that there is an underestimate of the true prevalence of porcine cysticercosis in the lake kyoga basin.
a previous seroprevalence study was carried out in a smaller geographical area on the southern shores of lake kyoga  which estimated a porcine infection prevalence of  <dig> %  <cit> .
the lake kyoga basin region is very large, covering many districts and is currently experiencing rapid growth of the pig population.
we felt there was need to carry out an extensive study on the prevalence of porcine cysticercosis in the whole of the lake kyoga basin.
porcine cysticercosis has a great impact on the public health of the community where it prevails  <cit> .
the purpose of this study was to determine the sero-prevalence of porcine cysticercosis in the lake kyoga basin to better understand the trend of procine cysticercosis in the study areas.
methods
ethical approval
the study was carried out with authority from the research and ethics committe of makerere university faculty of veterinary medicine.
approval was granted on the 14/05/ <dig>  reference vab/rec/08/ <dig>
study area
the study area comprised those districts adjoining lake kyoga in central uganda with pig populations of over  <dig>  head according to the ministry of agriculture, animal industry and fisheries  <cit> ).
within each of these  <dig> selected districts, one sub-county was chosen using simple random sampling to act as the study area.
the following sub-counties were sampled; galiraya sub-county for kayunga district, kidera sub-county for kamuli district, nawaikoke sub-county for kaliro district, nambiesio sub-county for apac district, bululu sub-county for kaberamaido district and kangai sub-county for amolator district.
in each sub-county, the two adjoining parishes with the highest number of pigs were selected for sampling.

n = sample size
z = the confidence interval for a normal distribution taken as  <dig>
p = the prevalence of cysticercosis based on previous study in kamuli district
q = 1-p
e = the level of precision
the minimum sample size required in each district was determined to be  <dig> pigs.
sample collection
a home-to-home-visit method was adopted to sample pigs  <cit> .
in the study areas, most households are found along village paths.
with guidance from the local authorities and the local veterinary staff, we moved along these paths from one end of the village towards the other.
houses were sampled at intervals of 400 m along the path, with the nearest pig-owning home to this distance being visited.
piglets are unlikely to acquire t. solium infections before 2-6weeks  <cit> , and t. solium circulating antigens are detectable 2– <dig> weeks post infection  <cit> .
it was therefore decided that pigs would be eligible for inclusion in the study at three months of age.
sows in the last trimester of pregnancy were excluded for fear of causing stress resulting in abortions.
one eligible pig was sampled from households with  <dig> of fewer pigs and  <dig> pigs were sampled from every homestead with  <dig> or more pigs with a total of  <dig> pig serum samples collected.
the project aims and objectives were explained to pig owners and their verbal consent was obtained prior to sampling their pigs.
the pig was cast in dorsal recumbencey and using a  <dig> gauge needle,  <dig> mls of blood was collected from the cranial vena cava into plain bd vaccutauners® and left at room temperature for 12 hours to allow adequate clotting.
the clotted blood was centrifuged to separate the serum which was then collected and stored in cryo-vials at −20°c until laboratory analysis.
laboratory analysis
samples were analyzed at the international livestock research institute  by antigen capture elisa, utilizing the hp <dig> monoclonal antibody   <cit> .
briefly, flat bottom immulon® 4hb x elisa plates were coated with 50% saturated  2s <dig> precipitate mcab hp <dig> at 10 g/ml diluted in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer  <dig>  ph .
after being coated overnight at 4°c the plate was washed in  <dig> % nacl with  <dig> % tween® <dig> and non-reacted binding sites blocked for one hour at room temperature using phosphate buffered saline   <dig>  ph  with 1% bovine serum albumin   and  <dig> % tween® <dig>  100 μl of undiluted sera was added to each well, incubated for one hour at 37°c, washed as before, then biotinilated mcab-hp <dig> diluted 1: <dig> with pbs/bsa/tween <dig> was added for 1 hr at 37°c.
after washing again, 100 μl per well of streptavidin peroxidise  conjugate at 1: <dig> dilution in pbs/bsa/tween <dig> was incubated for 1 hour at 37°c, followed by a further wash before  <dig>  3’,  <dig>  5’- tetramethylbenzidine  substrate  was added for 15 minutes at room temperature, the reaction stopped with  <dig>  m h2so <dig> and read in an elisa plate reader at 450 nm.
all samples were run in duplicate with five diluent control wells, five negative control wells and two positive control wells.
negative controls were obtained from indoor raised pigs from the uk which is free from t. solium cysticercosis and positive control sera was obtained from calves experimentally infected with t. saginata.
cut-off values were determined for each plate by using the mean optical density of all negative controls plus three standard deviations.
any sera sample with an optical density over this cut off was considered to be positive.
statistical analysis
results were entered into microsoft access  <dig> database and were analysed using the ‘r’ environment for statistical computing  <cit> .
RESULTS
<dig> pigs were sampled from  <dig> districts in the lake kyoga region.
the majority of pigs sampled were kept on a free-range basis although sows with suckling piglets were generally tethered.
sufficient sera were available to run the hp <dig> elisa on  <dig> samples, with an average of  <dig> samples per district .
the sero-prevalence of circulating t. solium antigens was found to be  <dig> %  with district prevalence ranging from  <dig> - <dig> % as shown in table  <dig>  with the geographical location of the sampling sites and their respective prevalence estimates indicated on figure  <dig> table  <dig>

discussion
the prevalence of t. solium cysticercosis determined through the hp <dig> ag-elisa was found to be  <dig> % .
this is similar to the prevalence levels found in several other sub-saharan countries where the parasite is endemic, including  <dig> % prevalence in mozambique  <cit> ,  <dig> % in kenya  <cit> ,  <dig> % in zambia  <cit>  and  <dig> % in cameroon  <cit> .
it is interesting to note, that a previous, smaller, study carried out in the districts of kamuli and kaliro in  <dig> indicated a prevalence of only  <dig> %  using the b60/b <dig> antigen elisa, although a rising prevalence had been noted between the  <dig> study and a  <dig> study using the insensitive lingual palpation method, which indicated a prevalence of up to  <dig> %  <cit> .
the drivers of increased prevalence in the study area is not clearly known, but there are several potential causes for this increase.
the increasing popularity of pig keeping and pork consumption may also be one of the drivers for increased prevalence of porcine cysticercosis.
an increased pig population, free ranging, in a t. solium contaminated environment will have higher chances to acquire infection.
although there is some evidence of successful interventions to control porcine cysticercosis in other countries  <cit> , there have not been any interventions carried out to control porcine cysticercosis in the lake kyoga basin and the transmission cycle has therefore been allowed to continue unabated.
the main economic activity in the lake kyoga basin is agriculture and it is very likely that that the farmers in the field often practise open defecation due to the long distance from their hometead latrines  <cit> .
this practice results in potentially infective feacal material being accessible by free ranging pigs, potenitally leading to increased prevalence of porcine cysticercosis.
it is also possible that this increased prevalence is due to infected pigs being moved into the study area.
in kayunga district we found that there had recently been massive deaths of pigs claimed to be due to african swine fever.
the pig population was therefore comprised of new pigs acquired by farmers from outside the study area.
it was therefore possible that the infected pigs acquired infection prior to moving into the study area.
unfortunately we did not obtain details of which pigs were part of this restocking procedure and this is therefore only conjecture.
the hp <dig> elisa has an estimated sensitivity and specificity of  <dig> %  ad  <dig> %  respectively  <cit> .
there is therefore the possibility that the prevalence estimate is not accurate due to undiagnosed or misdiagnosed infections, for instance due to cross reactions with t. hydategenia or other parasites.
fine dissection of full pig carcasses would have enabled direct visulisation of cysticercosis cellulosae and is therefore the ‘gold standard’ diagnostic for the porcine infection.
unfortunately there was no budget for such a technique and therefore the results of the angtigen elisa provide us with the best an indication of infection prevalence.
in the absence of a detailed analysis of risk factors, the reasons for this increase in prevalence are difficult to elucidate, but we feel that the key message from this study is that no successful efforts are being made in this region to control a parasite of high public health importance.
we would therefore like to strongly recommend that intervention packages for the taeniasis/cysticercosis complex, taking into account both human and porcine hosts are trialed and evaluated in order to begin the journey to eradicating this parasite.
CONCLUSIONS
this study found a high prevalence of viable t. solium infection in pigs in the region of lake kyoga basin.
this is a serious public health risk to both the consumers of pork and the wider community and we believe that measures are required to control this important zoonotic parasite in this area.

piglets are unlikely to acquire t. solium infections before 2-6weeks  <cit> , and t. solium circulating antigens are detectable 2– <dig> weeks post infection  <cit> . it was therefore decided that pigs would be eligible for inclusion in the study at three months of age. sows in the last trimester of pregnancy were excluded for fear of causing stress resulting in abortions. one eligible pig was sampled from households with  <dig> of fewer pigs and  <dig> pigs were sampled from every homestead with  <dig> or more pigs with a total of  <dig> pig serum samples collected. the project aims and objectives were explained to pig owners and their verbal consent was obtained prior to sampling their pigs. the pig was cast in dorsal recumbencey and using a  <dig> gauge needle,  <dig> mls of blood was collected from the cranial vena cava into plain bd vaccutauners® and left at room temperature for 12 hours to allow adequate clotting. the clotted blood was centrifuged to separate the serum which was then collected and stored in cryo-vials at −20°c until laboratory analysis.

laboratory analysis
samples were analyzed at the international livestock research institute  by antigen capture elisa, utilizing the hp <dig> monoclonal antibody   <cit> . briefly, flat bottom immulon® 4hb x elisa plates were coated with 50% saturated  2s <dig> precipitate mcab hp <dig> at 10 g/ml diluted in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer  <dig>  ph . after being coated overnight at 4°c the plate was washed in  <dig> % nacl with  <dig> % tween® <dig> and non-reacted binding sites blocked for one hour at room temperature using phosphate buffered saline   <dig>  ph  with 1% bovine serum albumin   and  <dig> % tween® <dig>  100 μl of undiluted sera was added to each well, incubated for one hour at 37°c, washed as before, then biotinilated mcab-hp <dig> diluted 1: <dig> with pbs/bsa/tween <dig> was added for 1 hr at 37°c. after washing again, 100 μl per well of streptavidin peroxidise  conjugate at 1: <dig> dilution in pbs/bsa/tween <dig> was incubated for 1 hour at 37°c, followed by a further wash before  <dig>  3’,  <dig>  5’- tetramethylbenzidine  substrate  was added for 15 minutes at room temperature, the reaction stopped with  <dig>  m h2so <dig> and read in an elisa plate reader at 450 nm. all samples were run in duplicate with five diluent control wells, five negative control wells and two positive control wells. negative controls were obtained from indoor raised pigs from the uk which is free from t. solium cysticercosis and positive control sera was obtained from calves experimentally infected with t. saginata. cut-off values were determined for each plate by using the mean optical density of all negative controls plus three standard deviations. any sera sample with an optical density over this cut off was considered to be positive.

statistical analysis
results were entered into microsoft access  <dig> database and were analysed using the ‘r’ environment for statistical computing  <cit> .

RESULTS
 <dig> pigs were sampled from  <dig> districts in the lake kyoga region. the majority of pigs sampled were kept on a free-range basis although sows with suckling piglets were generally tethered.

sufficient sera were available to run the hp <dig> elisa on  <dig> samples, with an average of  <dig> samples per district . the sero-prevalence of circulating t. solium antigens was found to be  <dig> %  with district prevalence ranging from  <dig> - <dig> % as shown in table  <dig>  with the geographical location of the sampling sites and their respective prevalence estimates indicated on figure  <dig> table  <dig>

discussion
the prevalence of t. solium cysticercosis determined through the hp <dig> ag-elisa was found to be  <dig> % . this is similar to the prevalence levels found in several other sub-saharan countries where the parasite is endemic, including  <dig> % prevalence in mozambique  <cit> ,  <dig> % in kenya  <cit> ,  <dig> % in zambia  <cit>  and  <dig> % in cameroon  <cit> . it is interesting to note, that a previous, smaller, study carried out in the districts of kamuli and kaliro in  <dig> indicated a prevalence of only  <dig> %  using the b60/b <dig> antigen elisa, although a rising prevalence had been noted between the  <dig> study and a  <dig> study using the insensitive lingual palpation method, which indicated a prevalence of up to  <dig> %  <cit> .

the drivers of increased prevalence in the study area is not clearly known, but there are several potential causes for this increase. the increasing popularity of pig keeping and pork consumption may also be one of the drivers for increased prevalence of porcine cysticercosis. an increased pig population, free ranging, in a t. solium contaminated environment will have higher chances to acquire infection. although there is some evidence of successful interventions to control porcine cysticercosis in other countries  <cit> , there have not been any interventions carried out to control porcine cysticercosis in the lake kyoga basin and the transmission cycle has therefore been allowed to continue unabated.

the main economic activity in the lake kyoga basin is agriculture and it is very likely that that the farmers in the field often practise open defecation due to the long distance from their hometead latrines  <cit> . this practice results in potentially infective feacal material being accessible by free ranging pigs, potenitally leading to increased prevalence of porcine cysticercosis.

it is also possible that this increased prevalence is due to infected pigs being moved into the study area. in kayunga district we found that there had recently been massive deaths of pigs claimed to be due to african swine fever. the pig population was therefore comprised of new pigs acquired by farmers from outside the study area. it was therefore possible that the infected pigs acquired infection prior to moving into the study area. unfortunately we did not obtain details of which pigs were part of this restocking procedure and this is therefore only conjecture.

the hp <dig> elisa has an estimated sensitivity and specificity of  <dig> %  ad  <dig> %  respectively  <cit> . there is therefore the possibility that the prevalence estimate is not accurate due to undiagnosed or misdiagnosed infections, for instance due to cross reactions with t. hydategenia or other parasites. fine dissection of full pig carcasses would have enabled direct visulisation of cysticercosis cellulosae and is therefore the ‘gold standard’ diagnostic for the porcine infection. unfortunately there was no budget for such a technique and therefore the results of the angtigen elisa provide us with the best an indication of infection prevalence.

in the absence of a detailed analysis of risk factors, the reasons for this increase in prevalence are difficult to elucidate, but we feel that the key message from this study is that no successful efforts are being made in this region to control a parasite of high public health importance. we would therefore like to strongly recommend that intervention packages for the taeniasis/cysticercosis complex, taking into account both human and porcine hosts are trialed and evaluated in order to begin the journey to eradicating this parasite.

CONCLUSIONS
this study found a high prevalence of viable t. solium infection in pigs in the region of lake kyoga basin. this is a serious public health risk to both the consumers of pork and the wider community and we believe that measures are required to control this important zoonotic parasite in this area.

","BACKGROUND
taenia solium is a zoonotic helminth with the potential to cause life threatening epilepsy in people through the aberrant larval infection of the brain called neurocysticercosis . the pig is the intermediate host for t. solium where the larval form, cysticercus cellulosae, normally develops after the pig eats eggs of the parasite. humans are the definitive host where the adult tapeworm develops and are infected through the consumption of poorly cooked, infected meat. t. solium has been acknowledged by the world health organization , food and agriculture organization  and uk department for international development  as being a neglected zoonotic disease, and was recently included in the who roadmap for control of neglected tropical diseases. this neglect encompasses a lack of epidemiological data and a lack of validated, effective control strategies being adopted. understanding the epidemiology of this parasite in the intermediate host is the first step towards designing suitable intervention strategies for the improvement of public health. this study was undertaken to provide an accurate and up-to-date estimate for the prevalence of porcine cysticercosis in the lake kyoga basin.


RESULTS
sera from  <dig> pigs were analysed with the hp <dig> antigen enzyme linked immunosorbant assay  and the prevalence was found to be  <dig> % . previous sero- surveillance in this region, using the b158/b <dig> ag elisa had indicated a prevalence of  <dig> % in  <dig> indicating a dramatic increase in prevalence  within a 6 year period.


CONCLUSIONS
this increasing prevalence in the disease indicates to us that there is currently no effective control of this parasite and that in this region of uganda at least; cysticercosis remains a neglected zoonotic disease.

"BACKGROUND
telithromycin has been the first ketolide to be approved for clinical use, specifically developed for treatment of community acquired respiratory tract infections  in order to overcome the spreading of resistance to macrolides among pneumococci  <cit> .
in comparison to macrolides, telithromycin shows notable improvements in antimicrobial and pharmacokinetic properties, even if it shares with macrolides the same bacterial target, represented by the ribosome  <cit> .
particularly, telithromycin has significantly lower minimum inhibitory concentration  than the macrolide antibiotics for many gram-positive organisms, i.e streptococcus.
pneumoniae that shows, at the ribosome, a dual-site binding to the drug  <cit> .
telithromycin is a concentration-dependent antibiotic, thus the concentrations achieved at the infection site are recognized as an important determinant of efficacy  <cit> .
due to the ability to penetrate into white blood cells and being characterized by high penetration rate, it may be delivered to sites of infections and reaches elevated concentrations in several tissues, particularly in the respiratory tract, comparable to those of macrolides and superior to β-lactams  <cit> .
h. influenzae, a major cause of carti  <cit> , demonstrates relatively good in vitro susceptibility to macrolides, azalides and ketolides, which show a unimodal mic distribution and low prevalence of high level resistance when defined by current clinical and laboratory standards institute  breakpoints  <cit> .
macrolides and azalides are currently recommended for treatment of community acquired pneumonia and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, with the antipneumococcal fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, as alternative agents in the most severe cases  <cit> .
due to the fact that the bactericidal activity of macrolides and ketolides is related to the level of drug concentration in the infected tissue  <cit> , the evaluation of antibacterial activity of concentrations achievable in vivo, particularly in epithelial lining fluid , against h. influenzae, which is one of the most common pathogen of these anatomical districts, may provide further information on telithromycin activity.
carbon dioxide has been proved to affect antibacterial activity of macrolides and ketolides, when assessed by determination of mic values  <cit> .
influence of co <dig> on bactericidal activity of ketolides and macrolides as measured by time kill curves has been less investigated.
the present study aimed mainly to evaluate the antibacterial activity of telithromycin concentration achievable in elf against h. influenzae clinical isolates with different pattern of resistance, in comparison with azithromycin and clarithromycin and the influence of co <dig> incubation on activity of telithromycin and macrolides.
methods
microorganisms
h. influenzae strains isolated from respiratory tract infections with the following phenotypes were tested: β-lactamase negative strains , β-lactamase producer strains , and β-lactamase negative ampicillin resistant  strains .
in order to avoid duplicate strains, only one isolate for each patient was considered.
the strains were stored at -80°c in haemophilus test medium  broth , supplemented with 10% glycerol before testing and checked for purity throughout the study by culture and gram staining
drugs
the following antibiotics, as pure substances or powder of stated potency, were considered: telithromycin , azithromycin  and clarithromycin .
stock solutions of antibiotics were prepared in 95% ethanol  and methanol  at concentrations of  <dig> mg/l and stored in aliquots at -20°c until use.
epithelial lining fluid concentrations tested by time kill curve assay were chosen from literature data and were equal to  <dig>  mg/l for azithromycin,  <dig> mg/l for clarithromycin and  <dig>  mg/l for telithromycin  <cit> .
concentration values for all tested drugs were chosen on the basis of similar study conditions.
in particular, studies on healthy volunteers were selected for this in vitro investigation due to the frequent inter-individual pharmacokinetics variability in patients
determination of minimum inhibitory concentration  and minimum bactericidal concentration
antibiotic susceptibilities to all the tested drugs were determined using a broth microdilution method according to the clsi approved standards  <cit> .
an adjusted inoculum of the tested organism was inoculated into haemophilus test medium broth containing two fold serial dilutions of a starting antibiotic solution, so that each well contained approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu/ml.
results were observed after  <dig> h of incubation at 37°c and mic was defined as the lowest concentration able to inhibit visible growth.
determination of mic values were performed both in presence and in absence of 10% co <dig>  mbc was determined by plating  <dig>  ml from the wells showing no visible growth on agar plates and incubating for 18– <dig> h in 10% co <dig> enriched atmosphere which assures the best environment for growth of h. influenzae.
mbc was considered as the concentration at which a  <dig> % reduction in cfu occurred, when compared with the original inoculum.
for each analytical series, quality controls were carried out with h. influenzae atcc  <dig> strains.
to interpret mic results, susceptibility breakpoints from clsi were used: susceptible mic ≤  <dig> mg/l, ≤  <dig> mg/l, ≤  <dig> mg/l for azithromycin, clarithromycin and telithromycin respectively, resistant mic >  <dig> mg/l, > <dig> mg/l and > <dig> mg/l for azithromycin, clarithromycin and telithromycin, respectively.
time kill curves
bactericidal activity of drugs under study were evaluated by performing time kill curves experiments on all h. influenzae strains.
htm broth containing drug concentrations equivalent to 1/ <dig> × mic, 1/ <dig> × mic;  <dig> × mic,  <dig> × mic,  <dig> × mic and to peak concentrations reachable by each drug in elf was inoculated with  <dig> ×  <dig> –  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu/ml, and incubated at 37°c in presence or absence of 10% co <dig>  viability counts of antibiotic containing suspensions and controls, lacking antibiotic, were obtained at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  <dig> and  <dig> h by plating 10-fold dilutions of  <dig>  ml aliquots from each tube onto chocolate agar plates, which were incubated for up to  <dig> h in co <dig> enriched atmosphere at 37°c.
a given concentration of antibiotic was considered bactericidal if it reduced the inoculum viable count by ≥  <dig> log <dig> cfu/ml, or bacteriostatic if it reduced the inoculum viable count by < <dig> log cfu/ml
RESULTS
antibacterial activity of azithromycin, clarithromycin and telithromycin against h. influenzae expressed as mic and mbc values and rate of susceptibility is depicted in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  where data obtained by incubating bacteria at ambient air or at 10% co <dig> are summarized.
telithromycin in ambient air showed activity against all the tested h. influenzae strains, with mic values ranging from ≤  <dig>  to  <dig> mg/l, and susceptibility rates of 100%, similar to the azithromycin rates.

in absence of co <dig>  all the strains were fully susceptible to the study drugs .
after incubation in co <dig>  the susceptibility rate was generally decreased , showing an interfering effect of this particular medium.

similar results were observed for β-lactamase positive h. influenzae strains with mic <dig>  mic <dig>  mbc <dig> and mbc <dig> equal to those observed for β-lactamase negative strains.
the microbiological activity of telithromycin was not significantly affected by β-lactamase production.
also in this case, the addition of co <dig> to the medium influenced the microbiological results, in terms of mic and mbc values and susceptibility rates: 100% of susceptibility in open air for all the tested drugs,  <dig> and 89% in co <dig> respectively for telithromycin and macrolides.
the  <dig> blnar strains were fully susceptible to the antibiotics in open air medium.
in co <dig> atmosphere, mic and mbc were higher in presence of co <dig> for all the tested antibiotics; the activity of telithromycin and clarithromycin was slightly superior to that of azithromycin being the susceptibility rate 90%, 90% and 80%, respectively.
results obtained in time-kill curves for azithromycin, clarithromycin and telithromycin against β-lactamase-negative, β-lactamase-positive and blnar h. influenzae are shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  bactericidal activities of telithromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin against h. influenzae were similar, independently from the pattern of resistance.
all these drugs were fully bactericidal after  <dig> hours at concentration of  <dig> × mic and after  <dig> hours at the highest concentrations  against β-lactamase-negative strains .
telithromycin and clarithromycin were bactericidal after  <dig> hours of incubation also at elf concentration, while at the same time, azithromycin was bactericidal at  <dig> × mic .
similar trends in bactericidal activities were observed for β-lactamase producer and blnar strains .
incubation of the bacterial culture in open air or in co <dig> seemed to slightly influence the killing curves, as, globally, no marked differences in bactericidal activity were observed between incubation in the presence or absence of co <dig>
discussion
the in vitro activity of telithromycin, the first ketolide developed for clinical use, has been widely evaluated in international and local studies, demonstrating a spectrum of activity that encompasses the key respiratory pathogens, including h. influenzae.
as the bactericidal activity of macrolides and ketolides is related to the magnitude of drug concentration at the site of infection, it is instrumental the evaluation of antimicrobial activity of concentrations achievable in vivo at the bronchial tree.
thus the present study assessed the comparative in vitro bacteriological activity and the killing kinetics of telithromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin against h. influenzae at concentrations multiple of the mic and equal to elf.
telithromycin in ambient air showed activity against all the tested h. influenzae strains, with susceptibility rates of 100%, similar to azithromycin.
the respective mbcs were from  <dig> to  <dig> fold higher than the mic, generally lower than the comparators.
previous in vitro studies have already showed that the in vitro potency against h. influenzae of telithomycin is similar to azithromycin, considered the most active macrolide against this pathogen, and superior to clarithomycin  <cit> .
the incubation in carbon dioxide affected the antibacterial activity of all the tested antibiotics, causing a notable increase in mics and mbcs, resulting in a decreased rate of susceptibility among h. influenzae strains.
susceptibility testing of respiratory tract pathogens is often performed in a co <dig> environment to ensure that the bacteria grow faster; however in this ambient the ph of the test medium decrease and macrolides and telithromycin activity seems adversely affected by this ph decrease.
thus the results of our study show that telithromycin susceptibility should be tested in ambient air, as well as that of macrolides.
notably, other recent in vitro studies have highlighted the adverse impact of co <dig> on susceptibility testing of telithromycin in key respiratory pathogens including h. influenzae  <cit> .
few studies have evaluated the bactericidal activity of telithromycin alone or in comparison with macrolides against respiratory pathogens, and in particular against h. influenzae  <cit> .
our data confirm the results of these studies, indicating that the bactericidal activity of telithromycin is mainly evident at concentrations as high as twice and four times the mic.
for all the tested antibiotics the killing of h. influenzae was not affected by different resistance patterns of the strains included into the study.
when mic concentrations were considered, bactericidal activities of the studied drugs were quite similar, with azithromycin showing a more rapid killing at  <dig> × mic.
however, although not fully bactericidal, activity of telithromycin against h. influenzae seemed superior in comparison with that of clarithromycin and close to that of azithromycin.
by contrast, when bactericidal activity of pulmonary concentrations was tested, telithromycin and clarithromycin showed a higher rate of killing than azithromycin on some strains, probably due to the inferior tissue distribution of this drug.
as both telithromycin and azithromycin are concentration dependent antibiotics, their penetration rate in site infection is an important determinant in predicting efficacy, thus mic, breakpoints of macrolides, azalides and ketolides against this organism must be considered together with their levels in respiratory tissues and elf.
there is growing evidence that, even though mics for macrolides against h. influenzae may be in the 'susceptible' range , in vivo bacteriological efficacy is poor against this pathogen, while pk/pd derived breakpoints seems to be more consistent with clinical outcomes  <cit> .
for both clarithromycin and azithromycin, the pk/pd breakpoint is five doubling dilutions lower than the clsi breakpoint  <cit> , while for telithromycin a breakpoint of  <dig>  mg/l has been proposed  <cit> .
by considering these values, all the strains evaluated in the present study should be considered resistant to the two macrolides, while some of them should be classified as susceptible to telithromycin.
however, determination of pk/pd breakpoints is usually based on serum concentrations chosen for optimal bacterial eradication and may not reflect the actual concentration at the site of infection, as occurs for the tested drugs which provide higher concentrations in the lungs than in other compartments, thus allowing higher susceptibility breakpoints when treating pulmonary infections.
CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, telithromycin showed an in-vitro potency against h. influenzae comparable to azithromycin, with a superior in-vitro killing rate to clarithromycin at 2x-mic against β-lactamase producers and blnar strains, and to azithromycin at elf concentrations against β-lactamase negative strains.
against all strains, mics and mbcs were lower in the absence of co <dig> for the tested antibiotics, showing an adverse effect of incubation in a co <dig> environment.
the in-vitro potency together with the pharmacokinetic profile of the antimicrobial, should be considered in predicting its efficacy in the empirical therapy of carti.

bactericidal activity of drugs under study were evaluated by performing time kill curves experiments on all h. influenzae strains. htm broth containing drug concentrations equivalent to 1/ <dig> × mic, 1/ <dig> × mic;  <dig> × mic,  <dig> × mic,  <dig> × mic and to peak concentrations reachable by each drug in elf was inoculated with  <dig> ×  <dig> –  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu/ml, and incubated at 37°c in presence or absence of 10% co <dig>  viability counts of antibiotic containing suspensions and controls, lacking antibiotic, were obtained at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  <dig> and  <dig> h by plating 10-fold dilutions of  <dig>  ml aliquots from each tube onto chocolate agar plates, which were incubated for up to  <dig> h in co <dig> enriched atmosphere at 37°c. a given concentration of antibiotic was considered bactericidal if it reduced the inoculum viable count by ≥  <dig> log <dig> cfu/ml, or bacteriostatic if it reduced the inoculum viable count by < <dig> log cfu/ml

RESULTS
antibacterial activity of azithromycin, clarithromycin and telithromycin against h. influenzae expressed as mic and mbc values and rate of susceptibility is depicted in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  where data obtained by incubating bacteria at ambient air or at 10% co <dig> are summarized. telithromycin in ambient air showed activity against all the tested h. influenzae strains, with mic values ranging from ≤  <dig>  to  <dig> mg/l, and susceptibility rates of 100%, similar to the azithromycin rates.

generally, mics and mbcs against β-lactamase negative h. influenzae strains were lower in absence of co <dig> for all the tested antibiotics, with a decrease from  <dig> to  <dig> fold in respect to the co <dig> incubation, being mic50/mic <dig> 2/ <dig> and 1/ <dig> mg/l for telithromycin, 8/ <dig> and 2/ <dig> mg/l for clarithromycin, 2/ <dig> and 1/ <dig> mg/l for azithromycin, after incubation with or without co <dig>  respectively.

the mbcs of telithromycin were closer to the mic values with respect to the two comparators. mbc50/mbc <dig> were 4/ <dig> and 1/ <dig> mg/l for telithromycin, 8/ <dig> and 4/ <dig> mg/l for clarithromycin, 4/ <dig> and 1/ <dig> mg/l for azithromycin after incubation with or without co <dig>  respectively. in absence of co <dig>  all the strains were fully susceptible to the study drugs . after incubation in co <dig>  the susceptibility rate was generally decreased , showing an interfering effect of this particular medium. the non-susceptible strains were included into the i  category, with the exclusion of  <dig> strains resistant to telithromycin. similar results were observed for β-lactamase positive h. influenzae strains with mic <dig>  mic <dig>  mbc <dig> and mbc <dig> equal to those observed for β-lactamase negative strains. the microbiological activity of telithromycin was not significantly affected by β-lactamase production. also in this case, the addition of co <dig> to the medium influenced the microbiological results, in terms of mic and mbc values and susceptibility rates: 100% of susceptibility in open air for all the tested drugs,  <dig> and 89% in co <dig> respectively for telithromycin and macrolides.

the  <dig> blnar strains were fully susceptible to the antibiotics in open air medium. in co <dig> atmosphere, mic and mbc were higher in presence of co <dig> for all the tested antibiotics; the activity of telithromycin and clarithromycin was slightly superior to that of azithromycin being the susceptibility rate 90%, 90% and 80%, respectively.

results obtained in time-kill curves for azithromycin, clarithromycin and telithromycin against β-lactamase-negative, β-lactamase-positive and blnar h. influenzae are shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  bactericidal activities of telithromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin against h. influenzae were similar, independently from the pattern of resistance. all these drugs were fully bactericidal after  <dig> hours at concentration of  <dig> × mic and after  <dig> hours at the highest concentrations  against β-lactamase-negative strains . telithromycin and clarithromycin were bactericidal after  <dig> hours of incubation also at elf concentration, while at the same time, azithromycin was bactericidal at  <dig> × mic .

similar trends in bactericidal activities were observed for β-lactamase producer and blnar strains .

incubation of the bacterial culture in open air or in co <dig> seemed to slightly influence the killing curves, as, globally, no marked differences in bactericidal activity were observed between incubation in the presence or absence of co <dig> 

discussion
the in vitro activity of telithromycin, the first ketolide developed for clinical use, has been widely evaluated in international and local studies, demonstrating a spectrum of activity that encompasses the key respiratory pathogens, including h. influenzae. as the bactericidal activity of macrolides and ketolides is related to the magnitude of drug concentration at the site of infection, it is instrumental the evaluation of antimicrobial activity of concentrations achievable in vivo at the bronchial tree. thus the present study assessed the comparative in vitro bacteriological activity and the killing kinetics of telithromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin against h. influenzae at concentrations multiple of the mic and equal to elf.

telithromycin in ambient air showed activity against all the tested h. influenzae strains, with susceptibility rates of 100%, similar to azithromycin. the respective mbcs were from  <dig> to  <dig> fold higher than the mic, generally lower than the comparators. previous in vitro studies have already showed that the in vitro potency against h. influenzae of telithomycin is similar to azithromycin, considered the most active macrolide against this pathogen, and superior to clarithomycin  <cit> .

the incubation in carbon dioxide affected the antibacterial activity of all the tested antibiotics, causing a notable increase in mics and mbcs, resulting in a decreased rate of susceptibility among h. influenzae strains.

susceptibility testing of respiratory tract pathogens is often performed in a co <dig> environment to ensure that the bacteria grow faster; however in this ambient the ph of the test medium decrease and macrolides and telithromycin activity seems adversely affected by this ph decrease. thus the results of our study show that telithromycin susceptibility should be tested in ambient air, as well as that of macrolides. notably, other recent in vitro studies have highlighted the adverse impact of co <dig> on susceptibility testing of telithromycin in key respiratory pathogens including h. influenzae  <cit> .

few studies have evaluated the bactericidal activity of telithromycin alone or in comparison with macrolides against respiratory pathogens, and in particular against h. influenzae  <cit> . our data confirm the results of these studies, indicating that the bactericidal activity of telithromycin is mainly evident at concentrations as high as twice and four times the mic. for all the tested antibiotics the killing of h. influenzae was not affected by different resistance patterns of the strains included into the study. when mic concentrations were considered, bactericidal activities of the studied drugs were quite similar, with azithromycin showing a more rapid killing at  <dig> × mic. however, although not fully bactericidal, activity of telithromycin against h. influenzae seemed superior in comparison with that of clarithromycin and close to that of azithromycin. by contrast, when bactericidal activity of pulmonary concentrations was tested, telithromycin and clarithromycin showed a higher rate of killing than azithromycin on some strains, probably due to the inferior tissue distribution of this drug.

as both telithromycin and azithromycin are concentration dependent antibiotics, their penetration rate in site infection is an important determinant in predicting efficacy, thus mic, breakpoints of macrolides, azalides and ketolides against this organism must be considered together with their levels in respiratory tissues and elf. there is growing evidence that, even though mics for macrolides against h. influenzae may be in the 'susceptible' range , in vivo bacteriological efficacy is poor against this pathogen, while pk/pd derived breakpoints seems to be more consistent with clinical outcomes  <cit> . for both clarithromycin and azithromycin, the pk/pd breakpoint is five doubling dilutions lower than the clsi breakpoint  <cit> , while for telithromycin a breakpoint of  <dig>  mg/l has been proposed  <cit> . by considering these values, all the strains evaluated in the present study should be considered resistant to the two macrolides, while some of them should be classified as susceptible to telithromycin. however, determination of pk/pd breakpoints is usually based on serum concentrations chosen for optimal bacterial eradication and may not reflect the actual concentration at the site of infection, as occurs for the tested drugs which provide higher concentrations in the lungs than in other compartments, thus allowing higher susceptibility breakpoints when treating pulmonary infections.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, telithromycin showed an in-vitro potency against h. influenzae comparable to azithromycin, with a superior in-vitro killing rate to clarithromycin at 2x-mic against β-lactamase producers and blnar strains, and to azithromycin at elf concentrations against β-lactamase negative strains. against all strains, mics and mbcs were lower in the absence of co <dig> for the tested antibiotics, showing an adverse effect of incubation in a co <dig> environment. the in-vitro potency together with the pharmacokinetic profile of the antimicrobial, should be considered in predicting its efficacy in the empirical therapy of carti.

"BACKGROUND
the origin of genetic novelty is of great interest in evolutionary biology.
as mutation is the ultimate source of all genetic variation, understanding the mutational processes that lead to novel genomic features such as new genes, expression patterns or system interactions is paramount.
the most commonly invoked mutational source of genetic novelty  is either segmental or whole genome duplication  <cit> .
more recently, the role of duplicative transposition – the copying and pasting of particular dna sequences from one part of genome to another – has been shown to play an important role in the evolution of new genes .
evidence from the human and mouse genomes indicates that, in addition to providing the source of the transpositional machinery, transposable elements   <cit>  can also provide the template dna for new genes or regulatory sequences  <cit> .
however, to understand the general role of te domestication in eukaryotic genome evolution, it is important to assess the acquisition of functional te sequences by host genomes in a variety of different species, and to understand in greater depth the population dynamics of these mutational events.
here we have investigated the incorporation of tes into mature transcripts in the fruitfly drosophila melanogaster, a species about which much is known in terms of the sequence and function of genic and intergenic regions.
to do so, we searched for potentially domesticated ""chimeric"" transcripts  backed by experimental support in the form of expressed sequence tag  evidence .
the focus of this study is gene-te associations contained within mrna transcripts , so here we do not consider tes that are either wholly contained in introns or located in the immediate vicinities of genes.
an advantage of our approach is that the gene-te chimeras identified are supported by experimental evidence rather than just by coordinate overlaps or mere proximity , and thus enriches for a subset of te insertions that may contribute to functional gene evolution in the host.
in addition, we have assessed the presence in wild populations of gene-te chimeras identified using the genome sequence, to gain insight into the evolutionary forces acting on these mutations in nature.
using a pooled-pcr strategy, we estimated population frequencies for a sample of chimeric te insertions in north american strains of d. melanogaster.
by comparing population frequencies of chimeric tes to those of non-chimeric tes of the same family from similar genomic contexts, we evaluated whether chimeric tes generally segregate either at unusually high frequencies  or at unusually low frequencies .
these results also revealed which of the gene-te chimeras detected in the genome sequence are likely to be constitutive components of the d. melanogaster transcriptome.
by comparing our set of gene-te chimeras to the entire set of annotated genes and tes in the d. melanogaster release  <dig> euchromatin, we show that a chimeric te insertion has a much lower probability than a non-chimeric te insertion of existing in the sequenced strain.
this extreme paucity of chimeric tes can be explained by the simple fact that te insertions generating chimeric transcripts are likely to be strongly deleterious for the host.
however, we find that the population frequencies of observed chimeric tes are generally indistinguishable from similarly paired non-chimeric te insertions, and we find that some chimeric te insertions can be found at high frequency in north american populations.
this pattern indicates that chimeric te insertions observed in the genome sequence do not differ substantially from non-chimeric tes in their selective effects, and that the d. melanogaster transcriptome permits a low-level flux of chimeric transcripts that may contribute to the formation of new gene sequences.
finally, we discuss the possibility that chimeric transcripts explain the curious phenomenon of regulated somatic expression of te transcripts in the developing drosophila embryo.
RESULTS
identification of chimeric gene-te transcripts in the d. melanogaster genome
in order to study the functional integration of te sequences into host genes, we identified te insertions present in mature transcripts of the d. melanogaster euchromatic release  <dig> genome sequence.
we call such transcripts ""chimeric"" as each of them has one component from a host gene and one from a te insertion.
in addition to using the standard methods in the field for directly finding genes and tes that share overlapping coordinates or querying annotated transcripts directly for te sequences  <cit> , we also sought evidence for chimeric transcripts using a novel three-step process based on expressed sequence tags  .
this indirect method of identifying gene-te chimeras was necessary to avoid annotation biases resulting from the fact that ""coding exons were not annotated in sequences with homology to transposable elements""  <cit>  in the d. melanogaster genome.
in total, we found  <dig> protein-coding genes that produce chimeric transcripts supported by est evidence .
these chimeric transcripts involve  <dig> different te insertions, but the relationship is not simply one-to-one: in two cases, te insertions  occur in overlapping 3'utrs of convergently transcribed neighboring genes producing two separate chimeric transcripts each ; and in one case, three te insertions are found in a chimeric transcript for a single gene  on the 4th chromosome.
in addition, we found one noncoding transcript, the αγ-element  <cit> , which is generated by two te insertions within a larger nest of tes situated between the hsp <dig> ba and bbb genes.
our screen appears to have high sensitivity as evidenced by the fact that we identified four of the five exonic te insertions previously reported in  <cit>  ; the single exonic jockey insertion in the gene cg <dig> reported in  <cit> ; and the chimeric transcript generated by a doc insertion into the gene chkov <dig>  reported in  <cit> .
we did not identify the bari- <dig> insertion in cyp12a <dig> recently reported in  <cit> , which is supported by est evidence, since the region of overlap  does not pass our length threshold.
we note that six of the  <dig> chimeric te insertions identified by blast-based methods do not have corresponding tes in the release  <dig>  annotation.
however, unannotated tes of the correct family can be found in the genome sequence for these chimeric te insertions .
this result indicates that an unknown proportion of real te insertions has not been annotated in the release  <dig> genome sequence .
to be able to analyze aspects of chimeric tes in the context of the genome annotation, we excluded these six te insertions from the ""annotated set"" of  <dig> te insertions, although we do consider them to be bona fide members of the ""total set"" of  <dig> potential gene-te chimeras in the d. melanogaster genome.
properties of chimeric gene-te transcripts
most of the  <dig> genes generating the total set of chimeric transcripts are of unknown function, but we did identify chimeric transcripts in  <dig> characterized protein-coding genes including brown , a gene that appears to be a hot-spot for natural te insertions  <cit>  and is known to carry a viable mutation  in the sequenced strain  <cit> .
our in silico screen also identified a chimeric te insertion generated by the serine protease encoding gene tequila that has recently been shown to impair the transcription of this gene, but with no apparent phenotypic consequences  <cit> .
a general analysis of the molecular function and cellular localization of the total set of genes with chimeric transcripts, however, did not indicate a significant enrichment of any particular gene ontology  category .
relative to other non-chimeric tes inserted in transcribed regions , the annotated set of tes present in chimeric transcripts is significantly enriched for ltr insertions .
this observation largely accounts for the fact that the annotated set is also enriched in long tes , since ltr insertions tend to be longer than other classes of te insertion in the genome  <cit> .
furthermore, chimeric tes have a greater tendency to be present in high-recombination areas of the genome than non-chimeric, intronic te insertions .
however, the overabundance of chimeric tes in regions of high recombination is not caused simply by the fact that chimeric transcripts are preferentially formed by ltr insertions, since high-recombination te insertions are over-represented among the chimeric non-ltr  elements even more strongly than among the chimeric ltrs .
te sequences are found in utrs in most of the chimeric transcripts they generate:  <dig> of the  <dig> te insertions are found in 3'utrs,  <dig> in the 5'utrs and  <dig> in coding exons.
we note that these numbers total more than  <dig> because two te insertions  fall into multiple categories.
the higher incidence of tes in utrs and specifically in 3'utrs parallels findings in the human and mouse genomes  <cit> .
the increased prevalence of te insertions in 3'utrs may be attributed to the increased average length of 3'utrs  relative to 5'utrs  in drosophila  <cit>  , or to the lower density of functional signals in 3' regions relative to 5' regions of genes.
this pattern does not appear to result from biases in the est libraries, since over  <dig> times more 5' ests were analyzed than 3' ests  <cit> .
surprisingly, the genes involved in chimeric transcripts are not always those nearest to the sites of the corresponding te insertions.
four chimeric transcripts skip one or more genes between the gene and te components of the transcript , thereby creating nested or intercalated gene arrangements.
the process of gene- or exon-skipping in chimeric transcript formation suggests a novel mutational mechanism to explain the surprisingly large proportion of nested genes in the d. melanogaster genome   <cit> , as well as the evolution of complex intercalated gene structures that cannot arise via simple mechanisms of gene duplication.
paucity of tes in mature transcripts indicates that chimeric te insertions are generally strongly deleterious
of the  <dig>  valid tes in the release  <dig>  annotation of the d. melanogaster genome sequence, we estimate that  <dig> are chimeric te insertions with some component co-transcribed in an exon,  <dig> are transcribed but entirely contained within spliced intronic sequences, and  <dig>  are entirely contained within intergenic sequences not currently annotated as transcribed.
a similar rank order pattern of te abundance in different functional compartments has been observed in the arabidopsis thaliana genome  <cit> .
these numbers of te insertions deviate significantly from their expected proportions based on the genome annotation of the  <dig>  mb release  <dig> sequence  .
this deviation from expectations is the result of two factors: there are fewer tes in transcribed regions than in intergenic regions   <cit> , and there is a further reduction in exonic regions relative to intronic regions .
the reduction in transcribed regions, however, is not solely caused by under-representation in exonic sequences, since the number of intronic te insertions is reduced relative to the number in intergenic regions .
together, these results indicate that there is a paucity of chimeric te insertions in the genome, and that the causes of this paucity go above and beyond the effects of simply being transcribed.
to estimate the extent to which the number of exonic te insertions is reduced while controlling for the effect of transcription per se on the distribution of tes, we use the number of intronic tes and the length of the intronic compartment of the genome to estimate the proportion of unobserved chimeric te insertions.
the total length of intronic regions in the d. melanogaster genome is approximately  <dig>  mb and the total length of exonic regions is  <dig>  mb  <cit> .
if the selective pressures on exonic tes were similar in magnitude to those on intronic tes we would expect to find approximately 414* =  <dig> te insertions in the predicted exonic  regions of the genome.
the fact that we detect only  <dig> chimeric tes out of an expected  <dig>  indicates that a chimeric te insertion is much more likely to be highly deleterious to the organism than a non-chimeric te insertion that is spliced out of a mature transcript.
these results are consistent with previous findings in the human genome, that the proportion of te-derived sequence increases with increasing distance upstream from the start of transcription  <cit> .
these calculations are based on a comparison of the annotated set of chimeric te insertions relative to the total set of annotated te insertions.
as noted above, however, our results reveal that an unknown proportion of tes in the release  <dig> sequence were not annotated in  <cit> .
if we assume that the frequency of unannotated tes in intronic regions is proportional to that of the unannotated te insertions in our sample , the expected number of te insertions in exonic regions would increase to 310* <dig>  =  <dig>  thus, using the total set under this proportionality assumption, the percentage of chimeric te insertions detected relative to expectation is little changed .
to the extent that the number of unannotated te insertions in introns is proportionally higher than in our sample, the percentage of observed chimeric te insertions decreases even further, strengthening the claim for a paucity of chimeric te insertions relative to expectation.
observed chimeric tes are not under unusual selective pressures
we estimated that ~80% of the tes that have been inserted into mature genic transcripts are immediately purged from the genome by strong purifying selection, and therefore are not observed in the sequenced strain.
what about the remaining ~20% of chimeric te insertions that we do detect?
we can envisage three scenarios to explain the existence of these chimeric te insertions: 1) they are under strong purifying selection, like the te insertions we do not observe; 2) they are adaptive, contributing useful sequences to the host genome; or 3) they are neither particularly deleterious nor particularly advantageous in comparison to the observed non-chimeric te insertions in the genome.
in order to evaluate these possibilities, we surveyed the frequencies of chimeric te insertions in wild d. melanogaster populations.
the presence of each te was tested in six pools of 8– <dig> north american strains  using a pcr procedure custom-designed for each chimeric te .
pool frequencies were used to estimate confidence bounds on population frequencies using a maximum likelihood procedure .
we were able to generate population data for  <dig> of the  <dig> annotated chimeric te insertions.
twenty-seven chimeric te insertions were found only in the sequenced strain, seven were found in all six-strain pools and  <dig> had intermediate pool frequencies.
these proportions of absent  and polymorphic  chimeric tes are very similar to a combined, non-random sample of  <dig> non-chimeric te insertions with previously reported population frequency data that map to annotated release  <dig> tes: absent  and polymorphic   <cit> .
the negative effects of intronic te insertions on transcription do not strongly affect this non-chimeric sample, since similar proportions of absent and polymorphic te insertions are observed in intronic  and intergenic  regions.
to determine whether the chimeric te insertions are, on aggregate, subject to unusual selective constraints, we compared each of their pool frequencies to those of similar, non-chimeric te insertions .
by ""similar,"" we mean that these te insertions came from the same family as their chimeric counterparts, that they had similar lengths, and were inserted in areas with similar recombination rates .
since the selective constraint on a te insertion is expected to increase with its length and the recombination rate of its genomic neighborhood  <cit> , we tried to bracket each chimeric te with a pair of similar non-chimeric family members: one with slightly higher, and one with slightly lower, length and recombination rate .
our null hypothesis was that the chimeric te insertions are neither particularly deleterious nor particularly advantageous in comparison with their non-chimeric counterparts.
if this null hypothesis is true, we expect the pool frequencies of non-chimeric te insertions in column  <dig> of table  <dig> to be no higher, and the pool frequencies in column  <dig> to be no lower, than those of the chimeric te insertions in column  <dig>
for the set of  <dig> te insertions for which we have population data, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no difference in pool frequencies between chimeric and non-chimeric te insertions.
neither the wilcoxon one-sided test nor the kruskal-wallis test reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative that pool frequencies of chimeric tes are significantly higher than those of their counterparts with greater lengths and recombination rates .
this indicates that, in general, the fact that a te insertion is chimeric does not increase the likelihood that it is at higher population frequency and is therefore potentially adaptive.
similarly, we find no evidence that chimeric tes in general have pool frequencies lower than those with shorter lengths and lower recombination rates .
thus, the fact that an observed te insertion is chimeric does not increase the likelihood that it is deleterious.
while we do not provide evidence for unusual selection pressures acting on chimeric te insertions overall, we do find a few exceptions to this general rule when te insertions are analyzed on an individual basis.
as shown in figure  <dig>  by comparing pool frequencies of chimeric tes to those of the two types of non-chimeric counterparts, we detect evidence for two exceptional chimeric te insertions.
one, a doc insertion , which creates a truncated version of the putative choline transferase gene chkov <dig> , has a significantly elevated population frequency  and has been reported previously to be a putatively adaptive te insertion  <cit> .
the second, a pogo  insertion into the fructose-bisphosphate encoding gene fbp, has a significantly decreased population frequency  and is likely to be more deleterious than similar non-chimeric pogo insertions.
discussion
we conducted a thorough search for te insertions in the mature transcripts of genes in the sequenced d. melanogaster genome.
to do so we used three different computational methods, including a novel, indirect est-based approach .
as with all est-based bioinformatics methods, this new approach to finding gene-te chimeras is subject to biases in est library composition.
such an approach was necessitated by annotation biases in the drosophila genome that would have caused any direct analysis of annotated transcripts to underestimate the number of putative chimeric transcripts in the genome.
despite these conflicting biases, most of the  <dig> genes generating chimeric transcripts were identified by more than one method , although each method revealed unique chimeric te insertions.
thus, multiple complementary approaches should be used in genome-wide studies of te domestication to overcome both annotation and methodological biases.
even using multiple methods for detecting chimeric transcripts, we estimate that only  <dig> % of protein coding genes in drosophila generate chimeric transcripts.
clearly the number of chimeric genes would be expected to increase somewhat with better annotation and/or increased est coverage.
nevertheless, the number of chimeric transcripts in the drosophila genome is likely to be more than an order of magnitude less than in the human and mouse genomes, where an estimated 27% and 18% of genes contain te sequences  <cit> .
these results together also suggest a rank order relationship between the proportion of chimeric genes and the amount of te dna in a genome   <cit> ; however, further studies are needed to evaluate the strength and generality of this trend.
even a low number of gene-te chimeras, such as presently observed in the d. melanogaster genome, may in the long-term contribute to the evolution of new transcripts and help explain unusual aspects of genomic organization structures such as nested or intercalated genes.
the low number of chimeric transcripts observed is not just the result of random effects of sparse te insertion or the deleterious effects of tes on transcription in the d. melanogaster genome.
in fact, we found far fewer chimeric te insertions in the genome than expected, relative to the number of non-chimeric te insertions found in introns.
this result indicates that the majority of te insertions that occur in mature gene transcripts have a much higher probability of being deleterious than non-chimeric, intronic ones.
the paucity of chimeric te insertions in exons relative to introns demonstrates that the deleterious effects of chimeric te insertions must exceed the cost of simply being transcribed, and probably results from improper translation or disruption of other functions of the mrna such as localization or stability.
many of these unobserved events may contribute to the genome-wide load of deleterious mutations found in natural populations of d. melanogaster  <cit> .
population frequencies of the chimeric te insertions observed in the genome sequence of the isogenized y; cn, bw, sp strain on the whole do not differ significantly from those of their non-chimeric counterparts.
this does not imply that chimeric te insertions found in the sequenced strain have no effects on fitness; rather that the distribution of their fitness effects is not substantially different from that of the non-chimeric te insertions located elsewhere in the genome.
at worst the observed chimeric te insertions may be weakly deleterious and counter-selected, in contrast to the unobserved chimeric te insertions, which are presumed to be strongly deleterious and purged rapidly from the population.
there is, however, some indirect evidence that chimeric te insertions may in fact be less weakly deleterious on average than non-chimeric te insertions.
if te insertions are weakly deleterious, we expect a skew towards genomic regions of lower recombination where natural selection is less effective due to increased linkage between alleles of opposing selective effects  <cit> .
this effect can be observed in the distribution of non-chimeric, intronic te insertions, but is not observed in the distribution of chimeric te insertions .
thus, a typical observed chimeric te insertion may in fact have a smaller negative effect on fitness than a typical non-chimeric te insertion.
this conclusion is supported by a lack of detectable fitness effects in direct experimental challenges on flies carrying the chimeric te insertion detected in the tequila  gene  <cit> .
the one te insertion we did identify as putatively adaptive  was previously identified in a randomly chosen set of ~ <dig> tes  <cit> .
we conclude that, in a search for adaptive te insertions, selecting chimeric te insertions is no better than selecting tes from the drosophila genome at random.
this is perhaps not surprising, considering our finding that there is nothing unusual about the fitness effects of observed chimeric te insertions.
it is possible, however, that our inability to detect a significant difference in selection pressures resulted from the relatively small sample of both chimeric and control te insertions studied here.
consideration of a larger number of strain pools will provide us with more statistical power and might show effects of chimerism on te fitness that were not detected in this study.
regardless of the forces that may have governed their history, we did identify seven chimeric te insertions that appear to be at high frequency or possibly even fixed in north american populations of d. melanogaster.
the existence of high frequency or fixed chimeric transcripts in the genome may provide a possible explanation for the curious observation of complex patterns of somatic gene expression exhibited by many ltr retrotransposons in d. melanogaster  <cit> .
these largely-unexplored patterns of transcription are typically explained either by the existence of regulatory elements internal to the te  or by the co-option of external cellular regulatory elements in the vicinity of a te insertion   <cit> .
the presence of chimeric transcripts in the d. melanogaster genome demonstrated here suggests a third possible mechanism for the observed pattern of somatic te expression: read-through transcription of a host gene into a te and cross-hybridization to a te specific probe.
under this model, regulated expression of a host gene that produces a chimeric transcript could be interpreted as regulated expression of the te included in the chimeric transcript.
we sought evidence for the possibility of read-through transcription as an explanation for regulated te expression by querying the second release of the bdgp in situ database  <cit>  for embryonic expression patterns of the tes and genes involved in chimeric transcripts detected in this study.
remarkably, as shown in figure  <dig>  we found that the embryonic expression pattern for developmental stages 11– <dig> of the gene cg <dig> is almost identical to the expression pattern determined directly for the  <dig> element that is involved in the chimeric transcript generated by this gene.
can read-through transcription from cg <dig> explain the pattern of expression of the  <dig> element?
we believe the answer to this question is no, for the simple reason that the probe used to determine the expression patterns of the  <dig> element  shares no sequences for potential cross-hybridization with the chimeric cg <dig> transcript .
in addition, the te insertion in cg <dig> is not fixed, whereas the pattern of  <dig> element expression is similar among different strains , suggesting that the presence of the  <dig> element insertion in cg <dig> is not required for embryonic expression pattern of the  <dig> element.
thus in the case of the  <dig> element, we conclude that the best candidate gene in the d. melanogaster genome cannot explain somatic te expression by production of a read-through chimeric transcript.
clearly more data will be necessary to evaluate the generality of this conclusion, but the lack of a role for read-though transcription in this case is generally consistent with the paucity and low population frequencies of the chimeric te insertions in the d. melanogaster genome  and with growing evidence for internal enhancer elements controlling regulated te transcription  <cit> .
CONCLUSIONS
in contrast to mammalian genomes, we found that fewer than 1% of drosophila genes produce mrnas that include bona fide te sequences, and that the vast majority of potential chimeric te insertions are likely to be deleterious and therefore unobserved in the genome sequence.
of those chimeric te insertions that have weak enough negative fitness effects to have been observed in the sequenced d. melanogaster genome, over half are restricted to the sequenced strain and fewer than ~15% are likely to be fixed and therefore contribute to the origin of new gene sequences in the d. melanogaster genome.
the relatively low numbers of fixed chimeric te insertions also argue against read-through transcription as a predominant mechanism for generating patterns of somatic te transcription in drosophila embryos.
these results also highlight the need to establish the fixity of putative cases of te domestication identified in other genome sequences in order to demonstrate their functional importance, and indicate that the process of te domestication may vary drastically among animal taxa.
",33,"BACKGROUND
the origin of genetic novelty is of great interest in evolutionary biology. as mutation is the ultimate source of all genetic variation, understanding the mutational processes that lead to novel genomic features such as new genes, expression patterns or system interactions is paramount. the most commonly invoked mutational source of genetic novelty  is either segmental or whole genome duplication  <cit> . more recently, the role of duplicative transposition – the copying and pasting of particular dna sequences from one part of genome to another – has been shown to play an important role in the evolution of new genes . evidence from the human and mouse genomes indicates that, in addition to providing the source of the transpositional machinery, transposable elements   <cit>  can also provide the template dna for new genes or regulatory sequences  <cit> . however, to understand the general role of te domestication in eukaryotic genome evolution, it is important to assess the acquisition of functional te sequences by host genomes in a variety of different species, and to understand in greater depth the population dynamics of these mutational events.

here we have investigated the incorporation of tes into mature transcripts in the fruitfly drosophila melanogaster, a species about which much is known in terms of the sequence and function of genic and intergenic regions. to do so, we searched for potentially domesticated ""chimeric"" transcripts  backed by experimental support in the form of expressed sequence tag  evidence . the focus of this study is gene-te associations contained within mrna transcripts , so here we do not consider tes that are either wholly contained in introns or located in the immediate vicinities of genes. an advantage of our approach is that the gene-te chimeras identified are supported by experimental evidence rather than just by coordinate overlaps or mere proximity , and thus enriches for a subset of te insertions that may contribute to functional gene evolution in the host.

in addition, we have assessed the presence in wild populations of gene-te chimeras identified using the genome sequence, to gain insight into the evolutionary forces acting on these mutations in nature. using a pooled-pcr strategy, we estimated population frequencies for a sample of chimeric te insertions in north american strains of d. melanogaster. by comparing population frequencies of chimeric tes to those of non-chimeric tes of the same family from similar genomic contexts, we evaluated whether chimeric tes generally segregate either at unusually high frequencies  or at unusually low frequencies . these results also revealed which of the gene-te chimeras detected in the genome sequence are likely to be constitutive components of the d. melanogaster transcriptome.

by comparing our set of gene-te chimeras to the entire set of annotated genes and tes in the d. melanogaster release  <dig> euchromatin, we show that a chimeric te insertion has a much lower probability than a non-chimeric te insertion of existing in the sequenced strain. this extreme paucity of chimeric tes can be explained by the simple fact that te insertions generating chimeric transcripts are likely to be strongly deleterious for the host. however, we find that the population frequencies of observed chimeric tes are generally indistinguishable from similarly paired non-chimeric te insertions, and we find that some chimeric te insertions can be found at high frequency in north american populations. this pattern indicates that chimeric te insertions observed in the genome sequence do not differ substantially from non-chimeric tes in their selective effects, and that the d. melanogaster transcriptome permits a low-level flux of chimeric transcripts that may contribute to the formation of new gene sequences. finally, we discuss the possibility that chimeric transcripts explain the curious phenomenon of regulated somatic expression of te transcripts in the developing drosophila embryo.

RESULTS
identification of chimeric gene-te transcripts in the d. melanogaster genome
in order to study the functional integration of te sequences into host genes, we identified te insertions present in mature transcripts of the d. melanogaster euchromatic release  <dig> genome sequence. we call such transcripts ""chimeric"" as each of them has one component from a host gene and one from a te insertion. in addition to using the standard methods in the field for directly finding genes and tes that share overlapping coordinates or querying annotated transcripts directly for te sequences  <cit> , we also sought evidence for chimeric transcripts using a novel three-step process based on expressed sequence tags  . this indirect method of identifying gene-te chimeras was necessary to avoid annotation biases resulting from the fact that ""coding exons were not annotated in sequences with homology to transposable elements""  <cit>  in the d. melanogaster genome.

in total, we found  <dig> protein-coding genes that produce chimeric transcripts supported by est evidence . these chimeric transcripts involve  <dig> different te insertions, but the relationship is not simply one-to-one: in two cases, te insertions  occur in overlapping 3'utrs of convergently transcribed neighboring genes producing two separate chimeric transcripts each ; and in one case, three te insertions are found in a chimeric transcript for a single gene  on the 4th chromosome. in addition, we found one noncoding transcript, the αγ-element  <cit> , which is generated by two te insertions within a larger nest of tes situated between the hsp <dig> ba and bbb genes. our screen appears to have high sensitivity as evidenced by the fact that we identified four of the five exonic te insertions previously reported in  <cit>  ; the single exonic jockey insertion in the gene cg <dig> reported in  <cit> ; and the chimeric transcript generated by a doc insertion into the gene chkov <dig>  reported in  <cit> . we did not identify the bari- <dig> insertion in cyp12a <dig> recently reported in  <cit> , which is supported by est evidence, since the region of overlap  does not pass our length threshold.

we note that six of the  <dig> chimeric te insertions identified by blast-based methods do not have corresponding tes in the release  <dig>  annotation. however, unannotated tes of the correct family can be found in the genome sequence for these chimeric te insertions . this result indicates that an unknown proportion of real te insertions has not been annotated in the release  <dig> genome sequence . to be able to analyze aspects of chimeric tes in the context of the genome annotation, we excluded these six te insertions from the ""annotated set"" of  <dig> te insertions, although we do consider them to be bona fide members of the ""total set"" of  <dig> potential gene-te chimeras in the d. melanogaster genome.

properties of chimeric gene-te transcripts
most of the  <dig> genes generating the total set of chimeric transcripts are of unknown function, but we did identify chimeric transcripts in  <dig> characterized protein-coding genes including brown , a gene that appears to be a hot-spot for natural te insertions  <cit>  and is known to carry a viable mutation  in the sequenced strain  <cit> . our in silico screen also identified a chimeric te insertion generated by the serine protease encoding gene tequila that has recently been shown to impair the transcription of this gene, but with no apparent phenotypic consequences  <cit> . a general analysis of the molecular function and cellular localization of the total set of genes with chimeric transcripts, however, did not indicate a significant enrichment of any particular gene ontology  category .

relative to other non-chimeric tes inserted in transcribed regions , the annotated set of tes present in chimeric transcripts is significantly enriched for ltr insertions . this observation largely accounts for the fact that the annotated set is also enriched in long tes , since ltr insertions tend to be longer than other classes of te insertion in the genome  <cit> . furthermore, chimeric tes have a greater tendency to be present in high-recombination areas of the genome than non-chimeric, intronic te insertions . however, the overabundance of chimeric tes in regions of high recombination is not caused simply by the fact that chimeric transcripts are preferentially formed by ltr insertions, since high-recombination te insertions are over-represented among the chimeric non-ltr  elements even more strongly than among the chimeric ltrs .

te sequences are found in utrs in most of the chimeric transcripts they generate:  <dig> of the  <dig> te insertions are found in 3'utrs,  <dig> in the 5'utrs and  <dig> in coding exons. we note that these numbers total more than  <dig> because two te insertions  fall into multiple categories. the higher incidence of tes in utrs and specifically in 3'utrs parallels findings in the human and mouse genomes  <cit> . the increased prevalence of te insertions in 3'utrs may be attributed to the increased average length of 3'utrs  relative to 5'utrs  in drosophila  <cit>  , or to the lower density of functional signals in 3' regions relative to 5' regions of genes. this pattern does not appear to result from biases in the est libraries, since over  <dig> times more 5' ests were analyzed than 3' ests  <cit> .

surprisingly, the genes involved in chimeric transcripts are not always those nearest to the sites of the corresponding te insertions. four chimeric transcripts skip one or more genes between the gene and te components of the transcript , thereby creating nested or intercalated gene arrangements. the process of gene- or exon-skipping in chimeric transcript formation suggests a novel mutational mechanism to explain the surprisingly large proportion of nested genes in the d. melanogaster genome   <cit> , as well as the evolution of complex intercalated gene structures that cannot arise via simple mechanisms of gene duplication.

paucity of tes in mature transcripts indicates that chimeric te insertions are generally strongly deleterious
of the  <dig>  valid tes in the release  <dig>  annotation of the d. melanogaster genome sequence, we estimate that  <dig> are chimeric te insertions with some component co-transcribed in an exon,  <dig> are transcribed but entirely contained within spliced intronic sequences, and  <dig>  are entirely contained within intergenic sequences not currently annotated as transcribed. a similar rank order pattern of te abundance in different functional compartments has been observed in the arabidopsis thaliana genome  <cit> . these numbers of te insertions deviate significantly from their expected proportions based on the genome annotation of the  <dig>  mb release  <dig> sequence  . this deviation from expectations is the result of two factors: there are fewer tes in transcribed regions than in intergenic regions   <cit> , and there is a further reduction in exonic regions relative to intronic regions . the reduction in transcribed regions, however, is not solely caused by under-representation in exonic sequences, since the number of intronic te insertions is reduced relative to the number in intergenic regions . together, these results indicate that there is a paucity of chimeric te insertions in the genome, and that the causes of this paucity go above and beyond the effects of simply being transcribed.

to estimate the extent to which the number of exonic te insertions is reduced while controlling for the effect of transcription per se on the distribution of tes, we use the number of intronic tes and the length of the intronic compartment of the genome to estimate the proportion of unobserved chimeric te insertions. the total length of intronic regions in the d. melanogaster genome is approximately  <dig>  mb and the total length of exonic regions is  <dig>  mb  <cit> . if the selective pressures on exonic tes were similar in magnitude to those on intronic tes we would expect to find approximately 414* =  <dig> te insertions in the predicted exonic  regions of the genome. the fact that we detect only  <dig> chimeric tes out of an expected  <dig>  indicates that a chimeric te insertion is much more likely to be highly deleterious to the organism than a non-chimeric te insertion that is spliced out of a mature transcript. these results are consistent with previous findings in the human genome, that the proportion of te-derived sequence increases with increasing distance upstream from the start of transcription  <cit> .

these calculations are based on a comparison of the annotated set of chimeric te insertions relative to the total set of annotated te insertions. as noted above, however, our results reveal that an unknown proportion of tes in the release  <dig> sequence were not annotated in  <cit> . if we assume that the frequency of unannotated tes in intronic regions is proportional to that of the unannotated te insertions in our sample , the expected number of te insertions in exonic regions would increase to 310* <dig>  =  <dig>  thus, using the total set under this proportionality assumption, the percentage of chimeric te insertions detected relative to expectation is little changed . to the extent that the number of unannotated te insertions in introns is proportionally higher than in our sample, the percentage of observed chimeric te insertions decreases even further, strengthening the claim for a paucity of chimeric te insertions relative to expectation.

observed chimeric tes are not under unusual selective pressures
we estimated that ~80% of the tes that have been inserted into mature genic transcripts are immediately purged from the genome by strong purifying selection, and therefore are not observed in the sequenced strain. what about the remaining ~20% of chimeric te insertions that we do detect? we can envisage three scenarios to explain the existence of these chimeric te insertions: 1) they are under strong purifying selection, like the te insertions we do not observe; 2) they are adaptive, contributing useful sequences to the host genome; or 3) they are neither particularly deleterious nor particularly advantageous in comparison to the observed non-chimeric te insertions in the genome.

in order to evaluate these possibilities, we surveyed the frequencies of chimeric te insertions in wild d. melanogaster populations. the presence of each te was tested in six pools of 8– <dig> north american strains  using a pcr procedure custom-designed for each chimeric te . pool frequencies were used to estimate confidence bounds on population frequencies using a maximum likelihood procedure .

we were able to generate population data for  <dig> of the  <dig> annotated chimeric te insertions. twenty-seven chimeric te insertions were found only in the sequenced strain, seven were found in all six-strain pools and  <dig> had intermediate pool frequencies. these proportions of absent  and polymorphic  chimeric tes are very similar to a combined, non-random sample of  <dig> non-chimeric te insertions with previously reported population frequency data that map to annotated release  <dig> tes: absent  and polymorphic   <cit> . the negative effects of intronic te insertions on transcription do not strongly affect this non-chimeric sample, since similar proportions of absent and polymorphic te insertions are observed in intronic  and intergenic  regions.

to determine whether the chimeric te insertions are, on aggregate, subject to unusual selective constraints, we compared each of their pool frequencies to those of similar, non-chimeric te insertions . by ""similar,"" we mean that these te insertions came from the same family as their chimeric counterparts, that they had similar lengths, and were inserted in areas with similar recombination rates . since the selective constraint on a te insertion is expected to increase with its length and the recombination rate of its genomic neighborhood  <cit> , we tried to bracket each chimeric te with a pair of similar non-chimeric family members: one with slightly higher, and one with slightly lower, length and recombination rate . our null hypothesis was that the chimeric te insertions are neither particularly deleterious nor particularly advantageous in comparison with their non-chimeric counterparts. if this null hypothesis is true, we expect the pool frequencies of non-chimeric te insertions in column  <dig> of table  <dig> to be no higher, and the pool frequencies in column  <dig> to be no lower, than those of the chimeric te insertions in column  <dig> 

for the set of  <dig> te insertions for which we have population data, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no difference in pool frequencies between chimeric and non-chimeric te insertions. neither the wilcoxon one-sided test nor the kruskal-wallis test reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative that pool frequencies of chimeric tes are significantly higher than those of their counterparts with greater lengths and recombination rates . this indicates that, in general, the fact that a te insertion is chimeric does not increase the likelihood that it is at higher population frequency and is therefore potentially adaptive. similarly, we find no evidence that chimeric tes in general have pool frequencies lower than those with shorter lengths and lower recombination rates . thus, the fact that an observed te insertion is chimeric does not increase the likelihood that it is deleterious.

while we do not provide evidence for unusual selection pressures acting on chimeric te insertions overall, we do find a few exceptions to this general rule when te insertions are analyzed on an individual basis. as shown in figure  <dig>  by comparing pool frequencies of chimeric tes to those of the two types of non-chimeric counterparts, we detect evidence for two exceptional chimeric te insertions. one, a doc insertion , which creates a truncated version of the putative choline transferase gene chkov <dig> , has a significantly elevated population frequency  and has been reported previously to be a putatively adaptive te insertion  <cit> . the second, a pogo  insertion into the fructose-bisphosphate encoding gene fbp, has a significantly decreased population frequency  and is likely to be more deleterious than similar non-chimeric pogo insertions.

discussion
we conducted a thorough search for te insertions in the mature transcripts of genes in the sequenced d. melanogaster genome. to do so we used three different computational methods, including a novel, indirect est-based approach . as with all est-based bioinformatics methods, this new approach to finding gene-te chimeras is subject to biases in est library composition. such an approach was necessitated by annotation biases in the drosophila genome that would have caused any direct analysis of annotated transcripts to underestimate the number of putative chimeric transcripts in the genome. despite these conflicting biases, most of the  <dig> genes generating chimeric transcripts were identified by more than one method , although each method revealed unique chimeric te insertions. thus, multiple complementary approaches should be used in genome-wide studies of te domestication to overcome both annotation and methodological biases.

the low number of chimeric transcripts observed is not just the result of random effects of sparse te insertion or the deleterious effects of tes on transcription in the d. melanogaster genome. in fact, we found far fewer chimeric te insertions in the genome than expected, relative to the number of non-chimeric te insertions found in introns. this result indicates that the majority of te insertions that occur in mature gene transcripts have a much higher probability of being deleterious than non-chimeric, intronic ones. the paucity of chimeric te insertions in exons relative to introns demonstrates that the deleterious effects of chimeric te insertions must exceed the cost of simply being transcribed, and probably results from improper translation or disruption of other functions of the mrna such as localization or stability. many of these unobserved events may contribute to the genome-wide load of deleterious mutations found in natural populations of d. melanogaster  <cit> .

there is, however, some indirect evidence that chimeric te insertions may in fact be less weakly deleterious on average than non-chimeric te insertions. if te insertions are weakly deleterious, we expect a skew towards genomic regions of lower recombination where natural selection is less effective due to increased linkage between alleles of opposing selective effects  <cit> . this effect can be observed in the distribution of non-chimeric, intronic te insertions, but is not observed in the distribution of chimeric te insertions . thus, a typical observed chimeric te insertion may in fact have a smaller negative effect on fitness than a typical non-chimeric te insertion. this conclusion is supported by a lack of detectable fitness effects in direct experimental challenges on flies carrying the chimeric te insertion detected in the tequila  gene  <cit> .

the one te insertion we did identify as putatively adaptive  was previously identified in a randomly chosen set of ~ <dig> tes  <cit> . we conclude that, in a search for adaptive te insertions, selecting chimeric te insertions is no better than selecting tes from the drosophila genome at random. this is perhaps not surprising, considering our finding that there is nothing unusual about the fitness effects of observed chimeric te insertions. it is possible, however, that our inability to detect a significant difference in selection pressures resulted from the relatively small sample of both chimeric and control te insertions studied here. consideration of a larger number of strain pools will provide us with more statistical power and might show effects of chimerism on te fitness that were not detected in this study.

regardless of the forces that may have governed their history, we did identify seven chimeric te insertions that appear to be at high frequency or possibly even fixed in north american populations of d. melanogaster. the existence of high frequency or fixed chimeric transcripts in the genome may provide a possible explanation for the curious observation of complex patterns of somatic gene expression exhibited by many ltr retrotransposons in d. melanogaster  <cit> . these largely-unexplored patterns of transcription are typically explained either by the existence of regulatory elements internal to the te  or by the co-option of external cellular regulatory elements in the vicinity of a te insertion   <cit> . the presence of chimeric transcripts in the d. melanogaster genome demonstrated here suggests a third possible mechanism for the observed pattern of somatic te expression: read-through transcription of a host gene into a te and cross-hybridization to a te specific probe. under this model, regulated expression of a host gene that produces a chimeric transcript could be interpreted as regulated expression of the te included in the chimeric transcript.

we sought evidence for the possibility of read-through transcription as an explanation for regulated te expression by querying the second release of the bdgp in situ database  <cit>  for embryonic expression patterns of the tes and genes involved in chimeric transcripts detected in this study. remarkably, as shown in figure  <dig>  we found that the embryonic expression pattern for developmental stages 11– <dig> of the gene cg <dig> is almost identical to the expression pattern determined directly for the  <dig> element that is involved in the chimeric transcript generated by this gene.

can read-through transcription from cg <dig> explain the pattern of expression of the  <dig> element? we believe the answer to this question is no, for the simple reason that the probe used to determine the expression patterns of the  <dig> element  shares no sequences for potential cross-hybridization with the chimeric cg <dig> transcript . in addition, the te insertion in cg <dig> is not fixed, whereas the pattern of  <dig> element expression is similar among different strains , suggesting that the presence of the  <dig> element insertion in cg <dig> is not required for embryonic expression pattern of the  <dig> element.  thus in the case of the  <dig> element, we conclude that the best candidate gene in the d. melanogaster genome cannot explain somatic te expression by production of a read-through chimeric transcript. clearly more data will be necessary to evaluate the generality of this conclusion, but the lack of a role for read-though transcription in this case is generally consistent with the paucity and low population frequencies of the chimeric te insertions in the d. melanogaster genome  and with growing evidence for internal enhancer elements controlling regulated te transcription  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in contrast to mammalian genomes, we found that fewer than 1% of drosophila genes produce mrnas that include bona fide te sequences, and that the vast majority of potential chimeric te insertions are likely to be deleterious and therefore unobserved in the genome sequence. of those chimeric te insertions that have weak enough negative fitness effects to have been observed in the sequenced d. melanogaster genome, over half are restricted to the sequenced strain and fewer than ~15% are likely to be fixed and therefore contribute to the origin of new gene sequences in the d. melanogaster genome. the relatively low numbers of fixed chimeric te insertions also argue against read-through transcription as a predominant mechanism for generating patterns of somatic te transcription in drosophila embryos. these results also highlight the need to establish the fixity of putative cases of te domestication identified in other genome sequences in order to demonstrate their functional importance, and indicate that the process of te domestication may vary drastically among animal taxa.

","to understand the general role of te domestication in eukaryotic genome evolution, it is important to assess the acquisition of functional te sequences by host genomes in a variety of different species, and to understand in greater depth the population dynamics of these mutational events.
this observation can be explained by the results of our population genomic analysis, which indicates that most potential chimeric tes in d. melanogaster are deleterious but that a small proportion may contribute to the evolution of novel gene sequences such as nested or intercalated gene structures.
our results highlight the need to establish the fixity of putative cases of te domestication identified using genome sequences in order to demonstrate their functional importance, and reveal that the contribution of te domestication to genome evolution may vary drastically among animal taxa.

we found a paucity of chimeric tes relative to expectations derived from non-chimeric tes, indicating that the majority  of tes that generate chimeric transcripts are deleterious and are not observed in the genome sequence.

recent analysis of the human and mouse genomes has shown that a substantial proportion of protein coding genes and cis-regulatory elements contain transposable element  sequences, implicating te domestication as a mechanism for the origin of genetic novelty. to understand the general role of te domestication in eukaryotic genome evolution, it is important to assess the acquisition of functional te sequences by host genomes in a variety of different species, and to understand in greater depth the population dynamics of these mutational events.


RESULTS
using an in silico screen for host genes that contain te sequences, we identified a set of  <dig> mature ""chimeric"" transcripts supported by expressed sequence tag  evidence in the drosophila melanogaster genome. we found a paucity of chimeric tes relative to expectations derived from non-chimeric tes, indicating that the majority  of tes that generate chimeric transcripts are deleterious and are not observed in the genome sequence. using a pooled-pcr strategy to assay the presence of gene-te chimeras in wild strains, we found that over half of the observed chimeric te insertions are restricted to the sequenced strain, and ~15% are found at high frequencies in north american d. melanogaster populations. estimated population frequencies of chimeric tes did not differ significantly from non-chimeric tes, suggesting that the distribution of fitness effects for the observed subset of chimeric tes is indistinguishable from the general set of tes in the genome sequence.


CONCLUSIONS
in contrast to mammalian genomes, we found that fewer than 1% of drosophila genes produce mrnas that include bona fide te sequences. this observation can be explained by the results of our population genomic analysis, which indicates that most potential chimeric tes in d. melanogaster are deleterious but that a small proportion may contribute to the evolution of novel gene sequences such as nested or intercalated gene structures. our results highlight the need to establish the fixity of putative cases of te domestication identified using genome sequences in order to demonstrate their functional importance, and reveal that the contribution of te domestication to genome evolution may vary drastically among animal taxa.

"BACKGROUND
deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems are driven by unique physical, geochemical and biological processes with specialized energy sources at the origin of the trophic web.
since the discovery of hydrothermal vents and their associated fauna in the galapagos rift, evidence of the establishment of dense faunal communities based on chemosynthesis have mounted over the past decades, and generally in relation to areas where tectonic movements and deep ocean volcanism are active  <cit> .
hydrothermal vent ecosystems are characterized by the synthesis of organic matter by means of chemo-autotrophic bacteria using reduced elements extracted from the hydrothermal fluids as source of energy  <cit> .
mussels in the genus bathymodiolus are biomass dominant at many known deep-sea hydrothermal vent and cold seep habitats.
survival in such extreme conditions requires unique anatomical and physiological adaptations.
for example the development of specialized gill epithelial cells harboring methanotrophic and thiotrophic endosymbiont bacteria constitutes one the best recognized adaptation strategies to chemosynthetic environments  <cit> .
dual symbiosis thus provides a clear nutritional advantage to bathymodiolid mussels, allowing them to obtain energy from both sulfide and methane at the vent sites  <cit> .
near the mid-atlantic ridge, and in the vicinity of the azores region, bathymodiolus azoricus subsists at vent sites, amid unusual levels of heavy metals, ph, temperature, co <dig>  methane and sulfide, while coping successfully with environmental microbes  <cit> .
despite its prominence as a model to study physiological adaptation to extreme physical and chemical conditions  <cit> , there is currently no large scale genome project for bathymodiolus species.
gene expression profiles are limited to a few est projects mainly originated from the evolution and genetics of marine populations team at the biological station of roscoff, france.
in a recent analysis, the screening of cdna libraries from whole bodies of b. azoricus resulted in  <dig> contigs and  <dig>  singletons.
many genes known to be involved in both metallic and oxidative stress responses were then identified  <cit> .
however, these data remain private and there is currently no published reports based on those sequences.
more recently, the effect of temperature on the vent mussel b. thermophilus was investigated by means of subtractive suppression hybridization experiments aimed at the identification of genes differentially expressed in response to different temperatures regimes  <cit> .
thus far, knowledge of deep-sea biology or of the molecules involved in the maintenance of homeostasis in hydrothermal vent animals has been limited in part by the lack of information about their genomes and systematic sequencing of expressed sequence tags to identify protein coding genes on a large scale.
the deep-sea vent biological systems represent the opportunity to study and provide new insights into the basic physiological principles that govern the defense mechanisms in vent animals and to understand how they cope with microbial infections.
the problem of microbial threat and the need for immunity exist in both deep sea and shallow water bivalves however differences in the genes of marine organisms living in so distinct habitats are likely to occur.
in order to significantly increase the number of b. azoricus genes in the public database and to discover new deep-sea vent adaptation-related genes in b. azoricus, and particularly for immune-related genes we have conducted a high-throughput experimental approach using pyrosequencing, on the  <dig> gs flx  with titanium chemistry, to sequence the transcriptome of b. azoricus gill tissues.
in the absence of a reference genome, this sequence method, which has not yet been widely applied to hydrothermal vent animals, holds great potential for discovery of genes and genetic markers in unconventional model species through de novo transcriptome sequence assembly.
the assembled and annotated sequences were produced and have been organized in a dedicated database, accessible through the website, http://transcriptomics.biocant.pt:8080/deepseavent providing an extensive catalog of genes expressed in gill tissues harboring immune cells, the hemocytes, of the deep-sea vent mussel bathymodiolus azoricus.
RESULTS
sequence analysis
a cdna library was constructed from mrna of fresh gill tissues from bathymodiolus azoricus collected at deep-sea vents and sequenced in a single gs flx titanium plate.
a total of  <dig>  raw nucleotide reads were produced with an average length of  <dig> bp, corresponding to  <dig>  mb.
after removal of the smart adaptors, by a custom script, the sequences were assembled with the mira software.
a total of  <dig>  quality reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs of which  <dig>  were singletons corresponding to a total of  <dig>  mb.
the length of the consensus sequences varied from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  bp, with an average length of  <dig> bp.
a summary of data is indicated in table  <dig>
*contigs without blastx matches at an e-value cut-off of 10- <dig> were queried again with blastx with an e-value cut-off of 10-2
** the difference between the number of transcripts and total number of amino-acid sequences is due to the possibility of a contig having more than one annotated protein hit.
<dig>  contigs were longer than  <dig> kb, and  <dig> longer than  <dig>  kb.
the distribution of contig length and est assembly by contig are shown in fig  <dig>
functional annotation
the contigs were annotated taking into consideration the identity of the translation frame, the conserved protein domains and gene ontology  terms.
to obtain the translation frame, all contigs were queried against the ncbi protein database  using blastx algorithm  <cit> , resulting in  <dig>  significant matches for an e-value ≤ 10- <dig>  the process was repeated for contigs without hits, increasing the e-value cut-off to 10- <dig>  and resulting in the identification of  <dig>  additional contigs.
the remaining contigs were processed through the estscan application  <cit> , from which it was possible to identify the coding frame for  <dig>  additional contigs.
a total of  <dig>  putative amino-acids sequences was obtained following this approach.
the entire set of amino-acid sequences hits was queried against the interpro database of protein families and functional domains http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro <cit> , from which  <dig>  were identified as bearing conserved protein domains.
the same set of sequences was annotated with gene ontology  terms resulting in  <dig>  functional assignments according to the organizing principles of go describing gene products and their properties.
this classification scheme was useful to assign bathymodiolus contigs to one of the major go annotation categories, i.e., biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions in a species-independent manner  <cit>  .
the largest proportion of go assigned sequences fell into broad categories for all three major go functional domains as presented in fig  <dig>  within the biological process, 31% and 32% of assignments corresponded to ""cellular process""  and ""metabolic process  respectively, followed by the ""localization""  and ""establishment of localization""  go categories.
furthermore, the matches of molecular function terms were most prevalent within the ""binding""  and ""catalytic activity"" , followed by the categories ""structural molecule activity""  and ""transporter activity"" .
finally for the cellular component go the most evident matches were within the ""cell part""  and ""cell""  terms, followed by ""organelle""  and ""macromolecular complex"" .
together, these go classes accounted for most of the assignable transcripts, and may represent a general gene expression profile signature for b. azoricus from the lucky strike hydrothermal vent field.
the contigs without any homology may correspond to one of the following categories: a) novel or diverged amino acid coding sequences that are specific to bathymodiolus species, b) represent mostly 3' or 5' untranslated regions  that would lack protein matches as they are non-coding or c) contain sequences to short to result in significant hits.
despite that the gene ontology project is aimed at describing gene product characteristics and gene product annotation data, by ways of a direct acyclic graph  structure of controlled vocabularies, the process of assigning go terms to gene products might prove difficult given the current go structured vocabulary and the systematic relationship between the go terms.
this follows from the fact that go describes how gene products behave in a cellular context and thus a gene product might be associated with or located in one or more cellular components; it is active in one or more biological processes, during which it performs one or more molecular functions.
immunity, stress and bacterial genes in bathymodiolus azoricus gills
the innate immune system acts to protect the individual from invasive bacteria, viruses, and eukaryotic pathogens by detecting molecular signatures of infection and initiating effector responses.
it probably originated early in animal phylogeny and is intimately related with wound healing and tissue maintenance functions among invertebrates  <cit> .
this defense system is essential for the survival of invertebrates which do not possess immunoglobulins and rely on unique capabilities to detect and respond to microbe associated molecular patterns  such as lipopolysaccharides , lipoteichoic acids, lipoproteins, peptidoglycan  and  β-d-glucans  <cit>  present on the cell surface of microorganisms.
upon recognition of the mamps, signal transduction molecules and transcription factors are set to mediate and control the expression of immune effector molecules, for example, the antimicrobial peptides.
the vent mussel b. azoricus has been the subject of previous studies, in our laboratory, aiming at the characterization of its cellular and humoral immune reactions as a means to better understand physiological adaptations to vent environments.
given the limited immune gene expression information available for this non-conventional model organism, a query-based strategy was used to identify coding sequences within the deepseavent database, for the selection and retrieval of nucleic acid information of cdnas corresponding to genes potentially involved in immune and inflammatory reactions.
therefore, the selection of candidate genes presented in table  <dig> was based on queries using specific descriptors matching immunity and inflammation-related criteria allowing thus the identification and retrieval of relevant cdna sequences from the transcriptome library.
the identification of putative genes was based on go annotation and querying the deepseavent database
a number of putative genes which have not previously been identified in b. azoricus were classified within the context of go representation and to one of the following immune categories: immune recognition, signal transduction, transcription and effector molecules , providing thus a classification resource for the investigation of specific processes, functions or cellular structures involved in animal physiological responses, particularly immune and stress-related responses, as demonstrated for the de novo analysis of the acropora millepora larval transcriptome  <cit> .
subsequently, the physical counterpart of these putative genes was confirmed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-pcr, using primers specifically designed on the basis of the newly identified est sequences and using the same source of cdna as for  <dig> pyrosequencing.
consequently,  <dig> sequencing artefacts could be discarded on the assumption that pcr amplifications of partial cdna of the candidate genes were successfully obtained.
even though the transcriptome library was normalized, it is still qualitatively possible to visualize different cdna abundance as pcr amplifications revealed different amplicon intensities for some of the confirmed genes, presumably due to different mrnas prevalence in the normalized cdna library .
this was further analyzed by quantitative pcr  utilizing non-normalized cdna as template for amplification of immune-related genes.
indeed, results demonstrated the differential abundance of transcripts in the non-normalized transcriptome library confirming that genes tested in our study are not expressed at the same level and are likely representing the transcriptional activity at the time animals were collected from the bottom of the sea .
particularly, the metal-binding metallothionein gene was highly expressed in the non-normalized transcriptome library, probably reflecting the physiological need for continuous production of this protein to overcome the metal stress occurring at vent sites and to regulate intracellular levels of metals.
other immune response representatives also showed increased levels of expression as compared to the remaining genes studied.
these include immune recognition molecule aggrecan and c-lectin, cell signalling molecule integrin, signal transduction complex component irak, and antibacterial protein defensin, , all providing evidence of a functional immune system in b. azoricus.
the selected putative genes are being currently investigated under controlled conditions in our laboratory, to assess the effect of long-term acclimatization in aquaria at atmospheric pressure, the effect of de novo hyperbaric stimulations in the ipocamp chamber and the effect of exposure to marine vibrio bacteria, on b. azoricus transcript profiling experiments  <cit> .
furthermore, this search-based analysis was also particularly important to determine a ""bacterial fingerprint"" in b. azoricus gill tissues, since we expected the vent mussel to have a rich microorganismal community and more specifically a substantial accumulation of endosymbiont bacteria within its gill tissues.
the selection of poly-a rna as the starting material for our transcriptome library likely eliminated many potential microbial sequences.
however,  <dig>  contigs in deepseavent presented protein match hits to bacterial phylotypes, supporting the evidence for the presence of bacteria in gill tissues of b. azoricus, and representing thus a potential bacterial fingerprint, most likely of chemoautotrophic nature, in deep-sea hydrothermal vent mussels.
additionally, a number of bacterial sequences were ascribed to several non-cultured marine bacteria, to chemolithoautotrophic, sulfur- or methane-oxidizing bacteria as evidenced, for instance, by the presence of the soxb, soxy, soxh, methane monooxygenase, biopolymer transport protein exbd/tolr genes when querying our database using interpro or go terms as ""methane"" or ""sulfur"".
similarly, searches using the genera calyptogena and riftia names returned several hundreds of putative protein sequences, the majority of which associated to endosymbionts from the giant hydrothermal vesicomyid clam and vestimentiferan tubeworm, respectively from the east pacific rise hydrothermal region.
such an approach has the potential to reveal sequences that have apparent bacterial origin including many genera of species that have been associated with mussel pathogens or as normal flora in the gut system  <cit> .
in this case, mutualistic interaction between symbiont bacteria and their animal hosts may be taken to another level of analysis based on transcriptome sequencing.
new genes involved in host recognition of endosymbionts and immune-effector mechanisms underlying host defense responses may shed light into understanding mutualism better and provide explanations as to how endosymbiont bacteria, living inside the bacteriocytes of vent mussels, are able to evade immune recognition, during early stages of acquisition and how mutualism is maintained.
one possible explanation might lie within the immune response itself, where constitutive immune responses of bacteriocytes towards the dense population of endosymbionts, might be expressed at different levels of the rest of the body and therefore, keeping endosymbionts under control  <cit> .
this hypothesis is currently under experimental consideration in our laboratory.
deep-sea vent mussel comparison to shallow water mussel
the deepseavent database was compared to mytibase, a recently created est database from the shallow water mussel, mytilus galloprovincialis  <cit> .
the comparison was restricted to the amino-acid sequences with interpro annotation from both databases and by setting the blast parameters to an e-value of 10- <dig> and bit scores ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  under such conditions  <dig>  and  <dig>  amino-acid sequences, respectively, were identified.
furthermore, the shared amino-acid sequences were analyzed in relation to the distribution of go functional annotation categories, using the  <dig>  sequences retrieved with a bit score of  <dig>  the highest percentage of common go-annotated sequences  between the two databases corresponded to the categories, cell killing, cellular component biogenesis, macromolecular complex and structural molecule activity .
biological process
vs
cellular component
molecular function
the fixed e-value 10- <dig> was kept for three different bit-scores .
the number of contigs with go ontology assignments shared between both databases is shown together with respective shared percentage
the biological significance of these findings was not immediately evaluated due the comparatively low amount of amino-acid sequences available in the mytibase as compared to deepseavent.
however, representatives of broad go categories are present in both mytibase and deepseavent databases, suggesting that mussels originated from distinct marine habitat may share common biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions.
such inter-database computational analyses offers now the potential to unravel genes specifically involved in hydrostatic pressure and chemosynthetic environmental adaptations by comparing transcriptome profiles from two closely related mytilid family members living in very distinct marine habitats.
CONCLUSIONS
comparison of our results with recently published transcriptomic studies on b. azoricus confirms the efficacy of  <dig> sequencing to reveal a large number of putative transcripts and significantly improve the genomic knowledge on this deep sea animal.
the use of  <dig> pyrosequencing to develop a new est collection containing potentially  <dig>  new transcripts provides a new resource for genome-wide association studies of vent mussel physiological variations, which is the focus of ongoing projects in our laboratory, addressing in particular the molecular adaptation mechanisms of b. azoricus to deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments.
this new resource now gathered in the deepseavent database will set the stage for innovative work and the establishment of large scale expression studies to validate the deep-sea vent mussel as a bone fide experimental model to study the biology of adaptation to deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments.

the deepseavent database was compared to mytibase, a recently created est database from the shallow water mussel, mytilus galloprovincialis  <cit> . the comparison was restricted to the amino-acid sequences with interpro annotation from both databases and by setting the blast parameters to an e-value of 10- <dig> and bit scores ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  under such conditions  <dig>  and  <dig>  amino-acid sequences, respectively, were identified. furthermore, the shared amino-acid sequences were analyzed in relation to the distribution of go functional annotation categories, using the  <dig>  sequences retrieved with a bit score of  <dig>  the highest percentage of common go-annotated sequences  between the two databases corresponded to the categories, cell killing, cellular component biogenesis, macromolecular complex and structural molecule activity .

the fixed e-value 10- <dig> was kept for three different bit-scores . the number of contigs with go ontology assignments shared between both databases is shown together with respective shared percentage

the biological significance of these findings was not immediately evaluated due the comparatively low amount of amino-acid sequences available in the mytibase as compared to deepseavent. however, representatives of broad go categories are present in both mytibase and deepseavent databases, suggesting that mussels originated from distinct marine habitat may share common biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions.

such inter-database computational analyses offers now the potential to unravel genes specifically involved in hydrostatic pressure and chemosynthetic environmental adaptations by comparing transcriptome profiles from two closely related mytilid family members living in very distinct marine habitats.

CONCLUSIONS
comparison of our results with recently published transcriptomic studies on b. azoricus confirms the efficacy of  <dig> sequencing to reveal a large number of putative transcripts and significantly improve the genomic knowledge on this deep sea animal. the use of  <dig> pyrosequencing to develop a new est collection containing potentially  <dig>  new transcripts provides a new resource for genome-wide association studies of vent mussel physiological variations, which is the focus of ongoing projects in our laboratory, addressing in particular the molecular adaptation mechanisms of b. azoricus to deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments. this new resource now gathered in the deepseavent database will set the stage for innovative work and the establishment of large scale expression studies to validate the deep-sea vent mussel as a bone fide experimental model to study the biology of adaptation to deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments.

","queries conducted within the database enabled the identification of genes putatively involved in immune and inflammatory reactions which had not been previously evidenced in the vent mussel.

"BACKGROUND
saccharomyces cerevisiae remains the preferred microbe for producing ethanol from pretreated lignocellulose, given its general robustness, high ethanol production rates and ethanol tolerance  <cit> .
critical interventions required to enhance the efficiency of this yeast for commercial 2nd generation ethanol production include  introducing capability to ferment xylose  <cit>  and  enhancing tolerance to toxic by-products from steam pretreatment  <cit> .
two approaches can be followed for introducing xylose utilising capability in s. cerevisiae, namely the cloning of xylose reductase  and xylitol dehydrogenase  or cloning xylose isomerase , usually in conjunction with xylulokinase  to convert xylulose to xylulose-5-phosphate.
these rational metabolic engineering approaches were exemplified in the respective benchmark studies of wahlbom et al.
<cit>  and kuyper et al.
<cit> .
other examples where rational approaches were followed for improved xylose metabolism include studies by gorsich et al.
<cit>  and toivari et al.
<cit> .
enhancing yeast tolerance, or “hardening” requires a more comprehensive intervention employing rational approaches to genome modification, random mutagenesis and directed evolutionary engineering under selective pressure .
it should be noted, however, that these techniques can also be employed to enhance xylose utilisation in the absence of hydrolysate inhibitors , which suggests technique overlap in achieving both improved xylose utilisation and inhibitor tolerance.
furthermore, rational approaches are often challenging due to the complexity of the yeast genome, requiring an in-depth understanding of the metabolome and its response to dynamic inputs, making the investigator reliant on a variety of “–omics” technologies  <cit> .
rational approaches were also occasionally found insufficient to instil required capabilities in the yeast phenotype  <cit> .
as such, random mutagenesis and selection followed by evolutionary engineering is often the methodological sequence of choice, where the former could lead to phenotypes with enhanced capabilities for either xylose utilisation or inhibitor tolerance but without prior knowledge of specific metabolic pathways.
the latter allows for selection under process-relevant conditions  <cit> , especially where inhibitors from lignocellulosic pretreatment are present.
in the literature, strain development predominantly focused on the xr/xdh/xk system where strains with the tmb prefix, produced by swedish researchers, featured quite prominently.
s. cerevisiae tmb <dig> produced by wahlbom et al.
<cit>  was later subjected to evolutionary engineering using furfural in sequential batch culture  <cit> , and in another study to sequential batch and continuous culture at a dilution rate  of  <dig>  h- <dig> using spruce hydrolysate, subsequent to uv mutagenesis  <cit> .
similarly, s. cerevisiae strain tmb <dig>  <cit>  also harbouring xr/xdh/xk was subjected to evolutionary engineering in continuous culture  in the absence of inhibitors to enhance xylose fermentation  <cit> , as well as in continuous culture  in the presence of hydrolysate  <cit> .
other strains of s. cerevisiae were also subjected to either mutagenesis  <cit>  or evolutionary engineering  <cit>  or both  <cit>  , with a few instances where other yeast species were also investigated for enhanced xylose utilisation, including scheffersomyces  stipitis <cit>  and pachysolen tannophilus <cit> .
amartey and jeffries  <cit>  described enhanced tolerance by a pichia strain after sequential subculture in different concentrations of corn cob hydrolysate, after overliming with ca <dig> and in an innovative approach, almario et al.
<cit>  used visualising evolution in real-time  to assess molecular mechanisms associated with short term adaptation  <cit>  in batch culture.
noteworthy studies pertaining to strain development harbouring the xylose isomerase  only appeared after the successful expression of xi from piromyces in s. cerevisiae <cit>  followed by evolutionary engineering in oxygen-limited chemostat culture at d =  <dig>  h- <dig> for  <dig> 000 hours in the absence of hydrolysate.
similar work was published by wisselink et al.
<cit>  and zhou et al.
<cit>  using sequential batch and continuous culture.
in these studies, cassettes containing several enzymes from the pentose phosphate pathway and for arabinose utilisation were transformed into s. cerevisiae.
however, in none of these studies were hydrolysates used as additional selective pressure criterion for evolutionary engineering of the xylose fermenting yeast in continuous culture.
in fact, to the knowledge of the authors, there appeared only one study where close to the full range of strain development techniques was applied to an xi-containing strain  <cit> .
using s. cerevisiae ethanol red as platform, the by now classical approach commenced with rational metabolic engineering through transformation with a cassette containing the xi gene from clostridium phytofermentans, followed by random mutagenesis using ems with hydrolysate and xylose as selective criteria.
gene shuffling preceded evolutionary engineering carried out in sequential batch culture without hydrolysate but at very high concentrations of xylose .
using a mating approach in a follow-up study  <cit> , this strain designated gs <dig> - <dig> was mated with another tolerant yeast strain after screening  <dig> yeast strains using dilute acid-pretreated spruce hydrolysate.
three resulting strains, designated as gsf <dig>  gsf <dig> and gse <dig> revealed a marked improved phenotype compared to ethanol red, producing up to 23%  more ethanol.
the purpose of the present study was to improve the inhibitor tolerance and simultaneously enhance xylose fermentation to ethanol of a recombinant xylose-utilising s. cerevisiae strain d5a+ harbouring the xyla gene from bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron producing xi.
“hardening” was accomplished through a combination of random mutagenesis with ems and long-term evolutionary engineering in chemostat culture using xylose as carbon source and liquor from steam-pretreated triticale straw as selective criteria at both steps .
the degree of hardening achieved was evaluated through comparison of the fermentative performance of the hardened yeast to the original parental strain, during exposure to pretreatment liquor supplemented with either glucose or xylose in batch culture.
two additional non-recombinant s. cerevisiae strains mel <dig> and mh <dig>  as well as s. cerevisiae strain tmb <dig>  were included for comparison.
finally, the fermentative performance of the hardened yeast under ssf conditions was assessed using pressed steam-pretreated sweet sorghum bagasse as substrate.
RESULTS
chemical characterisation of steam pretreated triticale straw and sweet sorghum bagasse
the chemical composition of the liquor from steam-pretreated triticale straw  and sweet sorghum bagasse  are shown in table  <dig>  the transition between the two feedstocks was required due to limited material availability.
xylose was the most abundant sugar in both the triticale and sorghum pretreatment liquor fractions.
this result supported the general observation that predominantly hemicellulose is solubilised during steam pretreatment  <cit>  although it should be noted that no acidic catalyst was used during pretreatment in the present study.
after steam pretreatment the wis fractions were first subjected to complete acid hydrolysis before chemical analysis.
glucose was the predominant sugar in the hydrolysed sweet sorghum wis fraction, which was expected since the wis fraction of the pretreated material was enriched for both lignin and cellulose, as previously documented  <cit> .
acetic acid was the most abundant by-product from steam-pretreatment, followed by furfural and hmf, in both the triticale and sweet sorghum pretreatment liquor fractions.
although the acetic acid concentration was significantly greater  in the sorghum pretreatment liquor, the sugar degradation products furfural and hmf were  <dig>  and  <dig>  times more concentrated in the triticale pretreatment liquor.
phenolic compounds and their respective degradation products were not quantified in this study.
given that hmf, furfural and acetic acid are the main by-products responsible for inhibition of microbial metabolism  <cit> , specific emphasis was placed on the concentration of these by-products as an indicator of pretreatment liquor toxicity.
conditions of steam pretreatment for triticale straw and sweet sorghum bagasse were 200°c for 20 min and 180°c for 5 min, respectively.
the chemical composition of the water insoluble solid fraction was determined after washing and subsequent to acid hydrolysis.
the composition of pretreated triticale straw wis was excluded from the table since this fraction was not utilised in this study.
standard deviations from duplicate analyses are also shown.
random mutagenesis
yeast cells that survived chemical mutagenesis after exposure to  <dig> and 3 μl ems/ml for 1 h were pooled and the growth compared to that of the parental d5a+ strain in a chemically-defined medium supplemented with diluted  and undiluted triticale pretreatment liquor with 20 g/l xylose as carbon source .
xylose in combination with the pretreatment liquor was essential for selecting mutants displaying functional xylose utilisation together with increased inhibitor tolerance.
as evident from figure  <dig>  mutants of strain d5a+ reached substantially greater total cell counts  than the parental d5a+ strain in the diluted liquor, whereas the undiluted liquor resulted in decreased cell counts, possibly resulting from cell lysis due to the harshness of the medium.
the dark medium colour precluded the use of turbidity to quantify culture growth, necessitating the use of serial dilutions and plate counts.
based on this data, a triticale hydrolysate concentration of 67%  was regarded as the maximum sub-lethal concentration to which the yeast could be exposed.
evolutionary engineering using continuous culture
mutated cells were subjected to evolutionary engineering using continuous culture at an initial dilution rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> for one week .
this low initial dilution rate would allow adaptation of cells to a relatively high pretreatment liquor concentration of 50%  while maintaining selective pressure, albeit at pretreatment liquor levels lower than the maximum sub-lethal concentration.
plate counts were used to confirm that the culture did not wash out of the reactor, upon which the dilution rate was incrementally adjusted over a further one week period to a dilution rate of  <dig>  h- <dig>  this dilution rate was maintained at a hydrolysate concentration of 50%  for  <dig> generations , after which the hydrolysate concentration was increased to 60%  for a further  <dig> generations .
substantial washout of the culture occurred at dilution rates greater than  <dig>  h- <dig>  which approximated the μmax value of  <dig>  h- <dig>  recorded in batch culture .
although attempts were made to attain steady state at a dilution rate close to  <dig>  h- <dig>  the proximity of this dilution rate to the critical dilution rate resulted in large variation in cell counts over a two week period at a hydrolysate concentration of 60% .
the absence of total wash-out could possibly be attributed to substantial wall growth after continuous growth for several weeks.
due to constraints in pretreatment liquor availability, no further increases in the concentration above 60%  were attempted.
the structure of the population was not characterised, where a single colony was isolated after two rounds of subculture on ypx agar  and used for subsequent work.
this strategy was based on the premise that after  <dig> generations  under stringent selective conditions , the culture would be predominantly comprised of strains with improved performance and hence, a greater probability of isolating a more resistant strain.
as the results showed, this was indeed the case.
developing an appropriate screening procedure of isolates with beneficial phenotypes is an ongoing activity in our group.

standard deviations represent triplicate determinations corresponding to measurements at three consecutive residence times.
analysis of strain performance in semi-aerobic batch culture
the strain isolated from continuous culture after  <dig> generations was designated as strain d5a+h and was grown in batch culture on either xylose or glucose to assess its ability to utilise these carbon sources in the presence of pretreatment liquor.
culture growth was also compared to three other strains of s. cerevisiae namely strains mel <dig>  <cit> , mh <dig>  <cit>  and tmb <dig>  <cit> , also supplemented with liquor from steam-pretreated triticale.
strain d5a+  was included as control on both carbon sources in the presence of liquor.
as additional control, the parental d5a+ strain was also grown in the defined medium without hydrolysate, with either xylose or glucose as carbon source.
in all other experiments the different strains were grown at a pretreatment liquor concentration of 50% .
fermentation profiles of the recombinant xylose-utilising yeast grown on xylose are shown in figure  <dig>  with the fermentation profiles on glucose shown in figure  <dig>  tables  <dig> and  <dig> provide a summary of fermentation parameters calculated from duplicate batch experiments.

in the presence of 50% pretreatment liquor with 20 g/l xylose as carbon source, strain d5a+h displayed a marked improvement in terms of culture growth compared to the control strain as evident from a more than 10-fold increase in biomass concentration .
strain d5a+h also exhibited a significantly shorter lag phase of less than 4 h compared to that of strain Тmb <dig> , which suggested that strain d5a+h exhibited a greater level of tolerance towards the inhibitors in the growth medium.
however, there was no significant difference between the μmax values of strains d5a+h and Тmb <dig> .
the performance of strain d5a+h stood in stark contrast to the poor growth and xylose utilisation of strain d5a+  in the presence of inhibitors.
furthermore, in the absence of inhibitors, the parental d5a+ strain produced no ethanol, whereas an ethanol concentration of up to  <dig>  g/l at an ethanol yield  of  <dig>  g/g xylose was recorded for strain d5a+h in the presence of inhibitors.
although low levels of glucose was present in the hydrolysate from pretreatment , this low concentration was insufficient to support an ethanol titre of  <dig>  g/l , pointing to improved ethanol fermentation from xylose by this strain subsequent to mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering.
xylose consumption by strain d5a+h closely followed culture growth attesting to its use as primary carbon source.
on the other hand, marked xylose consumption by strain Тmb <dig> only occurred towards the end of the cultivation period , with the magnitude of xylose consumption apparently not strongly correlated with the increase in biomass concentration.
in fact, the data revealed that strain d5a+h consumed 33% more xylose supplied to the culture than that consumed by strain tmb <dig> .
this level of consumption was also reflected in the more than 7-fold greater biomass yield  on xylose by the latter strain , which suggested that a carbon source other than xylose was preferentially utilised by strain tmb <dig>  conversely, the low yx/s for strain d5a+h might be attributable to ethanol production.
whereas no ethanol production was recorded for strain tmb <dig>  nor for strain d5a+ in the absence of liquor , an ethanol concentration of  <dig>  g/l was recorded for strain d5a+h , which pointed to increased efficiency in the conversion of xylose to ethanol, especially considering that the yx/s and yp/s values  for strain d5a+h were relatively similar .
the by-product time profiles for strains d5a+ tmb <dig> and d5a+h are shown in figure 2b, d and f, respectively.
the largest decrease in by-products coincided with the exponential growth phase of strains d5a+h and tmb <dig>  this inverse correlation was especially evident in the case of strain tmb <dig> where a distinct biphasic profile was evident and could be related to the longer lag phase of this culture, which lasted for up to 42 h. the shorter lag phase of strain d5a+h coincided with earlier commencement of by-product utilisation and/or detoxification.
no significant decrease in either organic acids or furaldehydes was observed in the d5a+ control culture, attributable to the absence of culture growth .
using glucose as carbon source, similar growth profiles were recorded for strains d5a+h  and tmb <dig>  in the presence of 50%  pretreatment liquor, which corresponded to that of the two reference strains, mh <dig> and mel <dig>  the μmax for strain d5a+h in the presence of inhibitors was marginally greater than that of the other strains , although a short lag phase of 4 h was apparent for this strain compared to the reference strains.
the μmax for the parental d5a+ strain was more than 20-fold lower than that recorded for strain d5a+h .
although the yx/s between the strains varied , the yx/s value of strain d5a+h was significantly greater than that of the other strains and could be related to the significantly greater biomass concentration recorded at the end of the exponential growth phase  and was corroborated by the significantly lower ethanol yield on glucose .
in other words, strain d5a+h clearly produced less ethanol relative to biomass , although the greater biomass concentration of this strain resulted in an ethanol titre similar to that of the other strains at the end of the exponential growth phase.
due to a severe lag phase in excess of 48 h recorded for the d5a+ parental strain, the data for this strain was omitted from figure  <dig>  the by-product profiles displayed in figure 3b, d, f and h showed a substantial decrease in the acetic acid concentration for strains d5a+h , tmb <dig> , mh <dig>  and mel <dig> , respectively.
no clear pattern of formic acid removal was distinguishable for strains tmb <dig>  mh <dig> and mel <dig>  whereas the formic acid concentration in the culture of strain d5a+h decreased by more than 65% over the cultivation period.
supplying either glucose or xylose as the primary carbon source distinctly affected the yeast metabolism, evident from the absolute differences in the fermentation parameters presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the most prominent differences between strains d5a+ and Тmb  <dig> are highlighted here.
in the absence of pretreatment liquor with xylose as carbon source, the μmax of strain d5a+ was 34% lower than with glucose, whereas the biomass yield coefficient was almost 7-fold greater.
ethanol production was absent with xylose as carbon source, whereas comparatively high levels of ethanol was produced on glucose.
a similar response was evident for strain tmb <dig> where the μmax value on xylose was 36% lower than on glucose, with a substantially lower yx/s value on glucose , and complete absence of ethanol formation.
although these perturbations were less pronounced in the case of strain d5a+h, the most prominent difference was the ability of the latter strain to produce ethanol when xylose was the sole source of carbon.
however, xylose was not as effectively utilised as a fermentable carbon source compared to glucose .
strain performance during simultaneous saccharification and fermentation
fermentation profiles for strains d5a+h and tmb <dig> during simultaneous saccharification and fermentation  are presented in figure  <dig> using the water-insoluble solids  from steam-pretreated sweet sorghum bagasse as carbon source.
although it would have been preferable to continue with triticale solids we were restricted to using limited amounts of sorghum solids, whereas most hydrolysate from triticale was consumed during continuous culture experiments.
given that this section of the work was to provide a first order assessment of strain performance in ssf in the presence of inhibitors, we opted for an approach where triticale hydrolysate was used for hardening and sorghum was used for ssf work, in light of the relatively similar inhibitor concentrations in the hydrolysate from both feedstocks.
although the pretreatment liquor was separated from the wis using a mechanical press, the solids were not washed prior to addition to the growth medium, which implied that a portion of the inhibitory by-products from the pretreatment liquor were carried into the ssf medium.
a fed-batch fermentation strategy was employed to reduce broth viscosity and minimise exposure of the culture to high inhibitor levels, where feed times are indicated by the arrows.
on sweet sorghum bagasse solids, strain d5a+h produced 45% more ethanol than strain tmb <dig> reaching a maximum of  <dig>  g/l after 150 h. although this concentration equated to a very low 50% of the theoretical maximum, accounting for both glucose and xylose in the wis and assuming a sugar to ethanol conversion factor of  <dig>  g/g, this data served to illustrate the difference in the performance of the yeasts, since much room for ssf optimisation remains.
for both strains, ethanol increased at the greatest rate before the third solids feed at 48 h, followed by a substantial decrease in the ethanol production rate.
the profiles of residual glucose and xylose concentrations also differed distinctly between the two strains.
for strain tmb <dig>  residual glucose levels remained consistently below 2 g/l throughout the fermentation, in spite of the addition of substrate at  <dig>   <dig> and 72 hrs.
in the case of strain d5a+h, glucose accumulated to levels above  <dig>  g/l directly after the addition of substrate at  <dig> and 48 hrs, after which consumption again commenced.
the accumulation in residual glucose in the culture of strain d5a+h, and to a lesser extent with strain tmb <dig>  coincided with the levelling off of ethanol production.
with strain d5a+h a further increase in ethanol production again coincided with an increase in residual glucose consumption which occurred after approx.
96 h, whereas a less pronounced increase in ethanol production was evident for strain tmb <dig> after 118 h. no residual glucose was detected in the culture of strain d5a+h after  <dig> h, whilst a residual glucose concentration of  <dig>  g/l was recorded in the culture of strain tmb  <dig>  this observation suggested strong recovery by strain d5a+h from introduced toxic by-products after the third feed, especially in light of the final ethanol titres recorded in this culture, whereas the behaviour of strain tmb <dig> remained more consistent throughout the cultivation.
xylose accumulated throughout the fermentation of both strains tmb <dig> and d5a+h, although the final residual xylose concentration was more than 35%  lower for strain tmb <dig> when compared to strain d5a+h .
discussion
two key strain development techniques, namely random mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering were sequentially used to harden a recombinant s. cerevisiae strain d5a+ against inhibitors from steam-pretreated triticale straw.
simultaneously, selective pressure through xylose as carbon source was imposed during both steps to enhance the metabolism of this pentose sugar via the xi pathway.
xylose isomerase represents the advantage of avoiding co-factor imbalances in the microbial metabolism at low oxygen tension, as opposed to the xr/xdh pathway, where xr was found to prefer nadph as co-factor  <cit> .
furthermore, during evolutionary engineering, koppram et al.
<cit>  observed decreased xylose consumption by strain tmb <dig> , apparently due to competition for reductive power between xr and furaldehyde.
an expected outcome from the present study would thus be improved xylose fermentation to ethanol in semi-aerobic culture in the presence of pretreatment liquor from xi expression.
given the complexity of the yeast metabolism on xylose as carbon source in the presence of inhibitors, random mutagenesis presented a more practical approach than rational metabolic engineering  <cit>  to simultaneously enhance xylose fermentation and inhibitor tolerance.
as such, we resorted to chemical mutagenesis using ems where an expected outcome would be at least improved growth in the presence of hydrolysate inhibitors, using xylose as sole source of carbon compared to the parental strain as control.
evolutionary engineering for at least  <dig> generations at a high dilution rate  with xylose as sole source of carbon and in the presence of inhibitors from non-detoxified liquor would have the expected outcome of enhanced tolerance evidenced by an improved μmax value, and ethanol yield and productivity compared to known benchmark strains.
therefore, there is a clear correlation between the developmental steps employed and the outcomes expected from the study, namely  xylose fermentation from metabolic engineering using xi,  enhanced inhibitor tolerance and conversion from mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering, and  a superior phenotype for ethanol production from xylose or glucose also from mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering.
hardening methodology
the high dilution rate in our chemostat culture supplemented with hydrolysate would allow for strong selective pressure in favour of yeast cells with improved xylose carbon flow through the metabolism.
in this way cells with high growth rate would be selected.
most studies dealing with chemostat-based evolutionary engineering maintained continuous cultures at very low dilution rates in the region of d =  <dig>  to  <dig>  h- <dig>  <cit> .
whereas low dilution rates are normally used to select for substrate affinity  <cit> , the purpose in our study was to select for high growth rate, given the negative effect that inhibitors have on the culture μmax  <cit> .
this approach corresponds to the more frequent use of sequential batch culture for evolutionary engineering, where the culture would grow at μmax  <cit> .
theoretically, evolved strains with the ability to maintain a higher growth rate should become dominant in a culture at a dilution rate close to μmax.
an expected outcome would be an improvement in ethanol productivity, although this improvement was difficult to quantify in our work due to the absence of ethanol production by strain tmb <dig> and the parental strain in xylose batch cultures .
the benchmark strains outperformed strain d5a+h in terms of ethanol productivity in glucose batch cultures .
strain performance with xylose as carbon source
an oxidative metabolism implies a greater biomass yield than would be the case with a respiro-fermentative metabolism and hence, a concomitant decrease in the ethanol yield  <cit> .
this principle was patently evident from the data presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig> where the yx/s value of the parental d5a+ strain on glucose without hydrolysate supplementation was more than six-fold lower than when xylose was supplied as carbon source in the chemically defined medium, which implied a predominantly oxidative metabolism with xylose as carbon source.
these observations could, on the one hand, support the notion that s. cerevisiae fails to recognise xylose as a fermentable carbon source  <cit> .
on the other hand, the strain d5a+h produced  <dig>  g/l ethanol in the presence of 50%  pretreatment liquor, whereas no measurable ethanol was produced by strain tmb <dig> or by the parental d5a+ strain on xylose without pretreatment liquor .
furthermore, strain d5a+ exhibited strong ethanol production from glucose at a yield of  <dig>  g/g glucose , which still makes it a prime candidate for 2nd generation ethanol production from cellulose.
it is for the latter reason that the recombinant strain was subjected to mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering in an attempt to enhance xylose fermentation to ethanol, which was indeed accomplished.
this result suggested that the mutagenesis treatment and/or evolutionary engineering profoundly affected the metabolism for funnelling carbon from xylose into the emp pathway for ethanol production.
the reprogramming of these pathways was described by liu  <cit>  and could possibly have been responsible for our observed result.
complete genomic analysis, coupled with transcriptomic analysis is earmarked for the future to elucidate the nature of this modification.
the negative impact of inhibitors on the ethanol productivity and yield  <cit>  as well as on the biomass yield due to interactions between furaldehydes and acetic acid  <cit>  is well described.
previous reports also illustrated that yeast has a diminished ability to deal with the toxic effects exerted by lignocellulosic inhibitors when grown on xylose as carbon source  <cit> .
this theoretical basis might explain why the parental strain d5a+ in the present study was unable to grow and retain viable cell numbers on xylose in the presence of 50%  pretreatment liquor .
however, given this complete absence of growth of the un-adapted parental strain in the presence of inhibitors, the evolutionary engineering approach followed proved effective to introduce tolerance into the d5a yeast platform, as evident from the comparable μmax values of strains d5a+h and tmb <dig> .
the fact that the μmax of  <dig>  h- <dig> of the adapted strain d5a+h on xylose in the presence of pretreatment liquor  pretreatment liquor) was 68% lower than that of the parental strain without hydrolysate clearly illustrated the toxic effect of the inhibitors on this yeast, in spite of the level of tolerance that was introduced into the yeast .
notably the μmax value of strain tmb <dig> recorded in the present study on xylose in the presence of pretreatment liquor was comparable to data published by wahlbom et al.
<cit>  for that strain in aerobic bioreactor cultures without pretreatment inhibitors.
therefore, compared to strain d5a+h on xylose as carbon source, the presence of inhibitors appeared to have a less drastic effect on strain tmb <dig>  possibly attributable to the presence of xr.
furfural was shown to serve as an effective electron acceptor for xr, as evident from decreased xylitol formation, resulting in an improved ethanol yield  <cit> , although no ethanol production by strain tmb <dig> on xylose was observed in the present study .
furthermore, strain d5a+h exhibited a much shorter lag phase than strain tmb <dig>  where the lag phase for the latter strain lasted up to 30 h .
a long lag phase in the presence of inhibitors is a known occurrence, attributable to the time required for the cells to carry out detoxification  <cit> .
therefore, in spite of the inhibitory effect on strain d5a+h, the similarity of the growth rates between the two strains and the shorter lag phase pointed to our d5a+h strain as a possible candidate for further development for industrial fermentations.
the in situ conversion of hmf and furfural by strain d5a+h was clearly superior compared to the parental d5a+ strain and tmb  <dig> .
hence, hmf and furfural removal commenced immediately after inoculation due to a comparatively shorter lag phase, and similar to that reported by palmqvist and hahn-hägerdal  <cit> .
previous reports identified a range of oxido-reductases as the primary enzymes responsible for the in situ reduction of hmf and furfural to their less toxic alcohol derivatives  <cit> , such as the native reductases adh <dig> and adh <dig>  <cit> .
one may, therefore, speculate on enhanced catalytic activity and/or higher degree of expression by one or more of these reductases brought on by mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering of strain d5a+h.
less than 12% of the xylose consumed by strain d5a+h was converted to ethanol , which implies accumulation of another metabolite, since the total recovered carbon from biomass, ethanol and glycerol was only 60%.
xylitol production has been observed in recombinant s. cerevisiae strains expressing xi and was ascribed to the endogenous activity of non-specific nadph-dependent aldo-ketoreductases expressed from the gre <dig> gene  <cit> .
xylitol was not quantified during these fermentations, and future investigations will verify whether xylitol can account for these discrepancies in the carbon mass balance and transcriptomic profiling as well as enzyme activity data is required to validate this hypothesis.
the ability of strain d5a+h to attain high growth rates and a shorter lag phase in spite of the presence of weak organic acids may point to a decreased sensitivity towards anion accumulation.
the more abundant organic acids, i.e.
acetic and formic acid, also play a pivotal role in contributing to pretreatment liquor toxicity  <cit> .
however these acids are typically not reduced in a typically enzyme-mediated manner, as is the case for hmf and furfural  <cit> , but rather accumulate intracellularly in dissociated form due to the neutrality of the cytosol  <cit> .
the detoxification profiles show acetic and formic acid  decreasing over time, with the fastest overall removal of these weak acids apparent for strain d5a+h.
this observation could probably be related to earlier onset of cell growth.
the greater biomass concentration probably resulted in faster diffusion of weak acids down its concentration gradient into the cytoplasm of the yeast cells.
although a large proportion of these anions were probably still secreted, this efflux was probably masked by increasing biomass and repetition of the cycle.
strain performance with glucose as carbon source
compared to the parental d5a+ strain in the absence of pretreatment liquor, the influence of inhibitors on the cultures with glucose as carbon source was clearly evident from μmax values that were up to  <dig> -fold lower  and qp values that were up to  <dig> -fold lower .
this data clearly illustrated the dramatic negative effect of inhibitors on productivity rates, whereas the biomass and ethanol yield was affected to a much lesser extent and corresponded to data reviewed by liu  <cit> .
although strain d5a+h surpassed strains Тmb  <dig>  mh <dig> and mel <dig> in terms of biomass yield and growth rate, this better performance did not correspond to higher ethanol productivity or yield during growth on glucose .
the comparatively higher yx/s value of strain d5a+h on glucose could possibly be viewed as a secondary effect of mutagenesis and long term selection, since this trait was not observed in the parental yeast in the absence of pretreatment liquor.
on the other hand, strains mh <dig> and mel <dig>  which had comparatively lower μmax values, produced ethanol at a significantly greater rate than strains d5a+h or Тmb <dig>  this result is not surprising, given the robust nature of these yeasts, specifically strain mh <dig>  which was purposefully included due to its high ethanol productivity  <cit> .
the by-product detoxification profiles showed that both acetic and formic acid  decreased over time for all the strains.
however, once again strain d5a+h outperformed the other strains since approximately 20% more acetic acid was removed than was the case with strain tmb <dig>  this observation supports our previous suggestion of a decreased sensitivity to these acids was brought about through mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering.
practical implementation through simultaneous saccharification and fermentation
whereas our results clearly demonstrated a degree of inhibitor tolerance by strain d5a+h, it is also of industrial importance to evaluate its effectiveness during ssf using steam-treated material.
therefore the ability of this strain was assessed along with that of the benchmark strain tmb <dig> .
a fed-batch approach was followed, to allow for a higher solids content of 10% , whilst minimising yeast inhibition  <cit> , and viscosity and mass transfer effects.
the fed-batch strategy should also further assist in xylose metabolism by limiting the concentration of residual glucose  <cit> .
strain d5a+h performed substantially better than strain tmb <dig> in ssf culture with pressed wis, producing 46% more ethanol at a combined  theoretical yield of 50% vs. 34% for strain tmb <dig>  the data recorded for strain d5a+h was slightly below that reported in the literature where ethanol yields from steam-pretreated sorghum ranged between 60-64% of theoretical maximum  <cit> .
although xylose was poorly utilised by strain d5a+h in ssf culture, as evident from accumulation of residual xylose , it is possible that the greater ethanol titre produced by strain d5a+h could in part have stemmed from xylose, given the level of ethanol produced by this strain in batch cultures supplemented with hydrolysate and xylose .
conversely, a possible explanation for the comparatively poor degree of xylose utilisation observed for the d5a+h strain during ssf could be attributed to residual glucose levels that remained high for a large portion of the total fermentation time, which may have resulted in the inhibition of xylose consumption.
high concentrations of glucose are known to inhibit xylose transport in yeast, due to competition between the two substrates for the hexose transporters which have an inherently lower affinity for xylose  <cit> .
CONCLUSIONS
the adaptation of yeast cultures for the production of ethanol from pretreated lignocellulosic substrates is of critical importance due to the toxic nature of the broth after pretreatment.
whereas other methods such as recursive breeding and genome shuffling may also be employed to beneficiate multi-allelic traits such as ethanol productivity and inhibitor tolerance  <cit> , the experimental plan followed in this study yielded promising results.
therefore, we conclude that mutagenesis in combination with long term evolutionary engineering was successfully applied to introduce a greater level of tolerance in s. cerevisiae d5a+h, together with improved xylose fermentation.
to the knowledge of the authors, this is one of very few studies where ems treatment followed by evolutionary engineering at high hydrolysate concentrations with xylose as the sole source of carbon was successfully applied to a strain of s. cerevisiae harbouring the xi pathway for xylose consumption, resulting in comparatively superior performance to a known yeast benchmark.
the physiological changes achieved in this study included an improved ability to ferment xylose in the presence of steam pretreated triticale straw liquor in batch culture.
future studies will include a second phase of long-term adaptation with emphasis on selection for increased ethanolic fermentation of xylose in the presence of pretreatment liquor, by keeping the fermentation broth strictly anaerobic.
additionally, genome sequencing as well as transcriptomic profiling of d5a+h will be focused upon to elucidate the nature of the molecular mechanisms of tolerance inferred through the experimental approaches presented in this study, followed by directed mutagenesis at selected targets using a rational approach.
",917,"BACKGROUND
saccharomyces cerevisiae remains the preferred microbe for producing ethanol from pretreated lignocellulose, given its general robustness, high ethanol production rates and ethanol tolerance  <cit> . critical interventions required to enhance the efficiency of this yeast for commercial 2nd generation ethanol production include  introducing capability to ferment xylose  <cit>  and  enhancing tolerance to toxic by-products from steam pretreatment  <cit> .

two approaches can be followed for introducing xylose utilising capability in s. cerevisiae, namely the cloning of xylose reductase  and xylitol dehydrogenase  or cloning xylose isomerase , usually in conjunction with xylulokinase  to convert xylulose to xylulose-5-phosphate. these rational metabolic engineering approaches were exemplified in the respective benchmark studies of wahlbom et al.  <cit>  and kuyper et al.  <cit> . other examples where rational approaches were followed for improved xylose metabolism include studies by gorsich et al.  <cit>  and toivari et al.  <cit> . enhancing yeast tolerance, or “hardening” requires a more comprehensive intervention employing rational approaches to genome modification, random mutagenesis and directed evolutionary engineering under selective pressure . it should be noted, however, that these techniques can also be employed to enhance xylose utilisation in the absence of hydrolysate inhibitors , which suggests technique overlap in achieving both improved xylose utilisation and inhibitor tolerance. furthermore, rational approaches are often challenging due to the complexity of the yeast genome, requiring an in-depth understanding of the metabolome and its response to dynamic inputs, making the investigator reliant on a variety of “–omics” technologies  <cit> . rational approaches were also occasionally found insufficient to instil required capabilities in the yeast phenotype  <cit> . as such, random mutagenesis and selection followed by evolutionary engineering is often the methodological sequence of choice, where the former could lead to phenotypes with enhanced capabilities for either xylose utilisation or inhibitor tolerance but without prior knowledge of specific metabolic pathways. the latter allows for selection under process-relevant conditions  <cit> , especially where inhibitors from lignocellulosic pretreatment are present.

in the literature, strain development predominantly focused on the xr/xdh/xk system where strains with the tmb prefix, produced by swedish researchers, featured quite prominently. s. cerevisiae tmb <dig> produced by wahlbom et al.  <cit>  was later subjected to evolutionary engineering using furfural in sequential batch culture  <cit> , and in another study to sequential batch and continuous culture at a dilution rate  of  <dig>  h- <dig> using spruce hydrolysate, subsequent to uv mutagenesis  <cit> . similarly, s. cerevisiae strain tmb <dig>  <cit>  also harbouring xr/xdh/xk was subjected to evolutionary engineering in continuous culture  in the absence of inhibitors to enhance xylose fermentation  <cit> , as well as in continuous culture  in the presence of hydrolysate  <cit> . other strains of s. cerevisiae were also subjected to either mutagenesis  <cit>  or evolutionary engineering  <cit>  or both  <cit>  , with a few instances where other yeast species were also investigated for enhanced xylose utilisation, including scheffersomyces  stipitis <cit>  and pachysolen tannophilus <cit> . amartey and jeffries  <cit>  described enhanced tolerance by a pichia strain after sequential subculture in different concentrations of corn cob hydrolysate, after overliming with ca <dig> and in an innovative approach, almario et al.  <cit>  used visualising evolution in real-time  to assess molecular mechanisms associated with short term adaptation  <cit>  in batch culture.

noteworthy studies pertaining to strain development harbouring the xylose isomerase  only appeared after the successful expression of xi from piromyces in s. cerevisiae <cit>  followed by evolutionary engineering in oxygen-limited chemostat culture at d =  <dig>  h- <dig> for  <dig> 000 hours in the absence of hydrolysate. similar work was published by wisselink et al.  <cit>  and zhou et al.  <cit>  using sequential batch and continuous culture. in these studies, cassettes containing several enzymes from the pentose phosphate pathway and for arabinose utilisation were transformed into s. cerevisiae. however, in none of these studies were hydrolysates used as additional selective pressure criterion for evolutionary engineering of the xylose fermenting yeast in continuous culture. in fact, to the knowledge of the authors, there appeared only one study where close to the full range of strain development techniques was applied to an xi-containing strain  <cit> . using s. cerevisiae ethanol red as platform, the by now classical approach commenced with rational metabolic engineering through transformation with a cassette containing the xi gene from clostridium phytofermentans, followed by random mutagenesis using ems with hydrolysate and xylose as selective criteria. gene shuffling preceded evolutionary engineering carried out in sequential batch culture without hydrolysate but at very high concentrations of xylose . using a mating approach in a follow-up study  <cit> , this strain designated gs <dig> - <dig> was mated with another tolerant yeast strain after screening  <dig> yeast strains using dilute acid-pretreated spruce hydrolysate. three resulting strains, designated as gsf <dig>  gsf <dig> and gse <dig> revealed a marked improved phenotype compared to ethanol red, producing up to 23%  more ethanol.

the purpose of the present study was to improve the inhibitor tolerance and simultaneously enhance xylose fermentation to ethanol of a recombinant xylose-utilising s. cerevisiae strain d5a+ harbouring the xyla gene from bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron producing xi. “hardening” was accomplished through a combination of random mutagenesis with ems and long-term evolutionary engineering in chemostat culture using xylose as carbon source and liquor from steam-pretreated triticale straw as selective criteria at both steps . the degree of hardening achieved was evaluated through comparison of the fermentative performance of the hardened yeast to the original parental strain, during exposure to pretreatment liquor supplemented with either glucose or xylose in batch culture. two additional non-recombinant s. cerevisiae strains mel <dig> and mh <dig>  as well as s. cerevisiae strain tmb <dig>  were included for comparison. finally, the fermentative performance of the hardened yeast under ssf conditions was assessed using pressed steam-pretreated sweet sorghum bagasse as substrate.

RESULTS
chemical characterisation of steam pretreated triticale straw and sweet sorghum bagasse
the chemical composition of the liquor from steam-pretreated triticale straw  and sweet sorghum bagasse  are shown in table  <dig>  the transition between the two feedstocks was required due to limited material availability. xylose was the most abundant sugar in both the triticale and sorghum pretreatment liquor fractions. this result supported the general observation that predominantly hemicellulose is solubilised during steam pretreatment  <cit>  although it should be noted that no acidic catalyst was used during pretreatment in the present study. after steam pretreatment the wis fractions were first subjected to complete acid hydrolysis before chemical analysis. glucose was the predominant sugar in the hydrolysed sweet sorghum wis fraction, which was expected since the wis fraction of the pretreated material was enriched for both lignin and cellulose, as previously documented  <cit> . acetic acid was the most abundant by-product from steam-pretreatment, followed by furfural and hmf, in both the triticale and sweet sorghum pretreatment liquor fractions. although the acetic acid concentration was significantly greater  in the sorghum pretreatment liquor, the sugar degradation products furfural and hmf were  <dig>  and  <dig>  times more concentrated in the triticale pretreatment liquor. phenolic compounds and their respective degradation products were not quantified in this study. given that hmf, furfural and acetic acid are the main by-products responsible for inhibition of microbial metabolism  <cit> , specific emphasis was placed on the concentration of these by-products as an indicator of pretreatment liquor toxicity.

conditions of steam pretreatment for triticale straw and sweet sorghum bagasse were 200°c for 20 min and 180°c for 5 min, respectively. the chemical composition of the water insoluble solid fraction was determined after washing and subsequent to acid hydrolysis. the composition of pretreated triticale straw wis was excluded from the table since this fraction was not utilised in this study. standard deviations from duplicate analyses are also shown.

random mutagenesis
yeast cells that survived chemical mutagenesis after exposure to  <dig> and 3 μl ems/ml for 1 h were pooled and the growth compared to that of the parental d5a+ strain in a chemically-defined medium supplemented with diluted  and undiluted triticale pretreatment liquor with 20 g/l xylose as carbon source . xylose in combination with the pretreatment liquor was essential for selecting mutants displaying functional xylose utilisation together with increased inhibitor tolerance. as evident from figure  <dig>  mutants of strain d5a+ reached substantially greater total cell counts  than the parental d5a+ strain in the diluted liquor, whereas the undiluted liquor resulted in decreased cell counts, possibly resulting from cell lysis due to the harshness of the medium. the dark medium colour precluded the use of turbidity to quantify culture growth, necessitating the use of serial dilutions and plate counts. based on this data, a triticale hydrolysate concentration of 67%  was regarded as the maximum sub-lethal concentration to which the yeast could be exposed.

evolutionary engineering using continuous culture
mutated cells were subjected to evolutionary engineering using continuous culture at an initial dilution rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> for one week . this low initial dilution rate would allow adaptation of cells to a relatively high pretreatment liquor concentration of 50%  while maintaining selective pressure, albeit at pretreatment liquor levels lower than the maximum sub-lethal concentration. plate counts were used to confirm that the culture did not wash out of the reactor, upon which the dilution rate was incrementally adjusted over a further one week period to a dilution rate of  <dig>  h- <dig>  this dilution rate was maintained at a hydrolysate concentration of 50%  for  <dig> generations , after which the hydrolysate concentration was increased to 60%  for a further  <dig> generations . substantial washout of the culture occurred at dilution rates greater than  <dig>  h- <dig>  which approximated the μmax value of  <dig>  h- <dig>  recorded in batch culture . although attempts were made to attain steady state at a dilution rate close to  <dig>  h- <dig>  the proximity of this dilution rate to the critical dilution rate resulted in large variation in cell counts over a two week period at a hydrolysate concentration of 60% . the absence of total wash-out could possibly be attributed to substantial wall growth after continuous growth for several weeks. due to constraints in pretreatment liquor availability, no further increases in the concentration above 60%  were attempted. the structure of the population was not characterised, where a single colony was isolated after two rounds of subculture on ypx agar  and used for subsequent work. this strategy was based on the premise that after  <dig> generations  under stringent selective conditions , the culture would be predominantly comprised of strains with improved performance and hence, a greater probability of isolating a more resistant strain. as the results showed, this was indeed the case. developing an appropriate screening procedure of isolates with beneficial phenotypes is an ongoing activity in our group.

steady state biomass concentrations, expressed as plate counts  for the mutated strain d5a+ at increasing dilution rates with the corresponding time at which the chemostat was operated at each dilution rate. the biomass concentration at the time of inoculation is shown for comparison. standard deviations represent triplicate determinations corresponding to measurements at three consecutive residence times.

analysis of strain performance in semi-aerobic batch culture
the strain isolated from continuous culture after  <dig> generations was designated as strain d5a+h and was grown in batch culture on either xylose or glucose to assess its ability to utilise these carbon sources in the presence of pretreatment liquor. culture growth was also compared to three other strains of s. cerevisiae namely strains mel <dig>  <cit> , mh <dig>  <cit>  and tmb <dig>  <cit> , also supplemented with liquor from steam-pretreated triticale. strain d5a+  was included as control on both carbon sources in the presence of liquor. as additional control, the parental d5a+ strain was also grown in the defined medium without hydrolysate, with either xylose or glucose as carbon source. in all other experiments the different strains were grown at a pretreatment liquor concentration of 50% . fermentation profiles of the recombinant xylose-utilising yeast grown on xylose are shown in figure  <dig>  with the fermentation profiles on glucose shown in figure  <dig>  tables  <dig> and  <dig> provide a summary of fermentation parameters calculated from duplicate batch experiments.

in the presence of 50% pretreatment liquor with 20 g/l xylose as carbon source, strain d5a+h displayed a marked improvement in terms of culture growth compared to the control strain as evident from a more than 10-fold increase in biomass concentration . strain d5a+h also exhibited a significantly shorter lag phase of less than 4 h compared to that of strain Тmb <dig> , which suggested that strain d5a+h exhibited a greater level of tolerance towards the inhibitors in the growth medium. however, there was no significant difference between the μmax values of strains d5a+h and Тmb <dig> . the performance of strain d5a+h stood in stark contrast to the poor growth and xylose utilisation of strain d5a+  in the presence of inhibitors. furthermore, in the absence of inhibitors, the parental d5a+ strain produced no ethanol, whereas an ethanol concentration of up to  <dig>  g/l at an ethanol yield  of  <dig>  g/g xylose was recorded for strain d5a+h in the presence of inhibitors. although low levels of glucose was present in the hydrolysate from pretreatment , this low concentration was insufficient to support an ethanol titre of  <dig>  g/l , pointing to improved ethanol fermentation from xylose by this strain subsequent to mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering.

xylose consumption by strain d5a+h closely followed culture growth attesting to its use as primary carbon source. on the other hand, marked xylose consumption by strain Тmb <dig> only occurred towards the end of the cultivation period , with the magnitude of xylose consumption apparently not strongly correlated with the increase in biomass concentration. in fact, the data revealed that strain d5a+h consumed 33% more xylose supplied to the culture than that consumed by strain tmb <dig> . this level of consumption was also reflected in the more than 7-fold greater biomass yield  on xylose by the latter strain , which suggested that a carbon source other than xylose was preferentially utilised by strain tmb <dig>  conversely, the low yx/s for strain d5a+h might be attributable to ethanol production. whereas no ethanol production was recorded for strain tmb <dig>  nor for strain d5a+ in the absence of liquor , an ethanol concentration of  <dig>  g/l was recorded for strain d5a+h , which pointed to increased efficiency in the conversion of xylose to ethanol, especially considering that the yx/s and yp/s values  for strain d5a+h were relatively similar .

the by-product time profiles for strains d5a+ tmb <dig> and d5a+h are shown in figure 2b, d and f, respectively. the largest decrease in by-products coincided with the exponential growth phase of strains d5a+h and tmb <dig>  this inverse correlation was especially evident in the case of strain tmb <dig> where a distinct biphasic profile was evident and could be related to the longer lag phase of this culture, which lasted for up to 42 h. the shorter lag phase of strain d5a+h coincided with earlier commencement of by-product utilisation and/or detoxification. no significant decrease in either organic acids or furaldehydes was observed in the d5a+ control culture, attributable to the absence of culture growth .

using glucose as carbon source, similar growth profiles were recorded for strains d5a+h  and tmb <dig>  in the presence of 50%  pretreatment liquor, which corresponded to that of the two reference strains, mh <dig> and mel <dig>  the μmax for strain d5a+h in the presence of inhibitors was marginally greater than that of the other strains , although a short lag phase of 4 h was apparent for this strain compared to the reference strains. the μmax for the parental d5a+ strain was more than 20-fold lower than that recorded for strain d5a+h . although the yx/s between the strains varied , the yx/s value of strain d5a+h was significantly greater than that of the other strains and could be related to the significantly greater biomass concentration recorded at the end of the exponential growth phase  and was corroborated by the significantly lower ethanol yield on glucose . in other words, strain d5a+h clearly produced less ethanol relative to biomass , although the greater biomass concentration of this strain resulted in an ethanol titre similar to that of the other strains at the end of the exponential growth phase. due to a severe lag phase in excess of 48 h recorded for the d5a+ parental strain, the data for this strain was omitted from figure  <dig>  the by-product profiles displayed in figure 3b, d, f and h showed a substantial decrease in the acetic acid concentration for strains d5a+h , tmb <dig> , mh <dig>  and mel <dig> , respectively. no clear pattern of formic acid removal was distinguishable for strains tmb <dig>  mh <dig> and mel <dig>  whereas the formic acid concentration in the culture of strain d5a+h decreased by more than 65% over the cultivation period.

supplying either glucose or xylose as the primary carbon source distinctly affected the yeast metabolism, evident from the absolute differences in the fermentation parameters presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the most prominent differences between strains d5a+ and Тmb  <dig> are highlighted here. in the absence of pretreatment liquor with xylose as carbon source, the μmax of strain d5a+ was 34% lower than with glucose, whereas the biomass yield coefficient was almost 7-fold greater. ethanol production was absent with xylose as carbon source, whereas comparatively high levels of ethanol was produced on glucose. a similar response was evident for strain tmb <dig> where the μmax value on xylose was 36% lower than on glucose, with a substantially lower yx/s value on glucose , and complete absence of ethanol formation. although these perturbations were less pronounced in the case of strain d5a+h, the most prominent difference was the ability of the latter strain to produce ethanol when xylose was the sole source of carbon. however, xylose was not as effectively utilised as a fermentable carbon source compared to glucose .

strain performance during simultaneous saccharification and fermentation
fermentation profiles for strains d5a+h and tmb <dig> during simultaneous saccharification and fermentation  are presented in figure  <dig> using the water-insoluble solids  from steam-pretreated sweet sorghum bagasse as carbon source. although it would have been preferable to continue with triticale solids we were restricted to using limited amounts of sorghum solids, whereas most hydrolysate from triticale was consumed during continuous culture experiments. given that this section of the work was to provide a first order assessment of strain performance in ssf in the presence of inhibitors, we opted for an approach where triticale hydrolysate was used for hardening and sorghum was used for ssf work, in light of the relatively similar inhibitor concentrations in the hydrolysate from both feedstocks. although the pretreatment liquor was separated from the wis using a mechanical press, the solids were not washed prior to addition to the growth medium, which implied that a portion of the inhibitory by-products from the pretreatment liquor were carried into the ssf medium. a fed-batch fermentation strategy was employed to reduce broth viscosity and minimise exposure of the culture to high inhibitor levels, where feed times are indicated by the arrows.

on sweet sorghum bagasse solids, strain d5a+h produced 45% more ethanol than strain tmb <dig> reaching a maximum of  <dig>  g/l after 150 h. although this concentration equated to a very low 50% of the theoretical maximum, accounting for both glucose and xylose in the wis and assuming a sugar to ethanol conversion factor of  <dig>  g/g, this data served to illustrate the difference in the performance of the yeasts, since much room for ssf optimisation remains. for both strains, ethanol increased at the greatest rate before the third solids feed at 48 h, followed by a substantial decrease in the ethanol production rate. the profiles of residual glucose and xylose concentrations also differed distinctly between the two strains. for strain tmb <dig>  residual glucose levels remained consistently below 2 g/l throughout the fermentation, in spite of the addition of substrate at  <dig>   <dig> and 72 hrs. in the case of strain d5a+h, glucose accumulated to levels above  <dig>  g/l directly after the addition of substrate at  <dig> and 48 hrs, after which consumption again commenced. the accumulation in residual glucose in the culture of strain d5a+h, and to a lesser extent with strain tmb <dig>  coincided with the levelling off of ethanol production. with strain d5a+h a further increase in ethanol production again coincided with an increase in residual glucose consumption which occurred after approx. 96 h, whereas a less pronounced increase in ethanol production was evident for strain tmb <dig> after 118 h. no residual glucose was detected in the culture of strain d5a+h after  <dig> h, whilst a residual glucose concentration of  <dig>  g/l was recorded in the culture of strain tmb  <dig>  this observation suggested strong recovery by strain d5a+h from introduced toxic by-products after the third feed, especially in light of the final ethanol titres recorded in this culture, whereas the behaviour of strain tmb <dig> remained more consistent throughout the cultivation. xylose accumulated throughout the fermentation of both strains tmb <dig> and d5a+h, although the final residual xylose concentration was more than 35%  lower for strain tmb <dig> when compared to strain d5a+h .

discussion
two key strain development techniques, namely random mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering were sequentially used to harden a recombinant s. cerevisiae strain d5a+ against inhibitors from steam-pretreated triticale straw. simultaneously, selective pressure through xylose as carbon source was imposed during both steps to enhance the metabolism of this pentose sugar via the xi pathway. xylose isomerase represents the advantage of avoiding co-factor imbalances in the microbial metabolism at low oxygen tension, as opposed to the xr/xdh pathway, where xr was found to prefer nadph as co-factor  <cit> . furthermore, during evolutionary engineering, koppram et al.  <cit>  observed decreased xylose consumption by strain tmb <dig> , apparently due to competition for reductive power between xr and furaldehyde. an expected outcome from the present study would thus be improved xylose fermentation to ethanol in semi-aerobic culture in the presence of pretreatment liquor from xi expression.

given the complexity of the yeast metabolism on xylose as carbon source in the presence of inhibitors, random mutagenesis presented a more practical approach than rational metabolic engineering  <cit>  to simultaneously enhance xylose fermentation and inhibitor tolerance. as such, we resorted to chemical mutagenesis using ems where an expected outcome would be at least improved growth in the presence of hydrolysate inhibitors, using xylose as sole source of carbon compared to the parental strain as control. evolutionary engineering for at least  <dig> generations at a high dilution rate  with xylose as sole source of carbon and in the presence of inhibitors from non-detoxified liquor would have the expected outcome of enhanced tolerance evidenced by an improved μmax value, and ethanol yield and productivity compared to known benchmark strains. therefore, there is a clear correlation between the developmental steps employed and the outcomes expected from the study, namely  xylose fermentation from metabolic engineering using xi,  enhanced inhibitor tolerance and conversion from mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering, and  a superior phenotype for ethanol production from xylose or glucose also from mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering.

hardening methodology
the high dilution rate in our chemostat culture supplemented with hydrolysate would allow for strong selective pressure in favour of yeast cells with improved xylose carbon flow through the metabolism. in this way cells with high growth rate would be selected. most studies dealing with chemostat-based evolutionary engineering maintained continuous cultures at very low dilution rates in the region of d =  <dig>  to  <dig>  h- <dig>  <cit> . whereas low dilution rates are normally used to select for substrate affinity  <cit> , the purpose in our study was to select for high growth rate, given the negative effect that inhibitors have on the culture μmax  <cit> . this approach corresponds to the more frequent use of sequential batch culture for evolutionary engineering, where the culture would grow at μmax  <cit> . theoretically, evolved strains with the ability to maintain a higher growth rate should become dominant in a culture at a dilution rate close to μmax. an expected outcome would be an improvement in ethanol productivity, although this improvement was difficult to quantify in our work due to the absence of ethanol production by strain tmb <dig> and the parental strain in xylose batch cultures . the benchmark strains outperformed strain d5a+h in terms of ethanol productivity in glucose batch cultures .

strain performance with xylose as carbon source
an oxidative metabolism implies a greater biomass yield than would be the case with a respiro-fermentative metabolism and hence, a concomitant decrease in the ethanol yield  <cit> . this principle was patently evident from the data presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig> where the yx/s value of the parental d5a+ strain on glucose without hydrolysate supplementation was more than six-fold lower than when xylose was supplied as carbon source in the chemically defined medium, which implied a predominantly oxidative metabolism with xylose as carbon source. these observations could, on the one hand, support the notion that s. cerevisiae fails to recognise xylose as a fermentable carbon source  <cit> . on the other hand, the strain d5a+h produced  <dig>  g/l ethanol in the presence of 50%  pretreatment liquor, whereas no measurable ethanol was produced by strain tmb <dig> or by the parental d5a+ strain on xylose without pretreatment liquor . furthermore, strain d5a+ exhibited strong ethanol production from glucose at a yield of  <dig>  g/g glucose , which still makes it a prime candidate for 2nd generation ethanol production from cellulose. it is for the latter reason that the recombinant strain was subjected to mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering in an attempt to enhance xylose fermentation to ethanol, which was indeed accomplished. this result suggested that the mutagenesis treatment and/or evolutionary engineering profoundly affected the metabolism for funnelling carbon from xylose into the emp pathway for ethanol production. the reprogramming of these pathways was described by liu  <cit>  and could possibly have been responsible for our observed result. complete genomic analysis, coupled with transcriptomic analysis is earmarked for the future to elucidate the nature of this modification.

the negative impact of inhibitors on the ethanol productivity and yield  <cit>  as well as on the biomass yield due to interactions between furaldehydes and acetic acid  <cit>  is well described. previous reports also illustrated that yeast has a diminished ability to deal with the toxic effects exerted by lignocellulosic inhibitors when grown on xylose as carbon source  <cit> . this theoretical basis might explain why the parental strain d5a+ in the present study was unable to grow and retain viable cell numbers on xylose in the presence of 50%  pretreatment liquor . however, given this complete absence of growth of the un-adapted parental strain in the presence of inhibitors, the evolutionary engineering approach followed proved effective to introduce tolerance into the d5a yeast platform, as evident from the comparable μmax values of strains d5a+h and tmb <dig> . the fact that the μmax of  <dig>  h- <dig> of the adapted strain d5a+h on xylose in the presence of pretreatment liquor  pretreatment liquor) was 68% lower than that of the parental strain without hydrolysate clearly illustrated the toxic effect of the inhibitors on this yeast, in spite of the level of tolerance that was introduced into the yeast .

notably the μmax value of strain tmb <dig> recorded in the present study on xylose in the presence of pretreatment liquor was comparable to data published by wahlbom et al.  <cit>  for that strain in aerobic bioreactor cultures without pretreatment inhibitors. therefore, compared to strain d5a+h on xylose as carbon source, the presence of inhibitors appeared to have a less drastic effect on strain tmb <dig>  possibly attributable to the presence of xr. furfural was shown to serve as an effective electron acceptor for xr, as evident from decreased xylitol formation, resulting in an improved ethanol yield  <cit> , although no ethanol production by strain tmb <dig> on xylose was observed in the present study . furthermore, strain d5a+h exhibited a much shorter lag phase than strain tmb <dig>  where the lag phase for the latter strain lasted up to 30 h . a long lag phase in the presence of inhibitors is a known occurrence, attributable to the time required for the cells to carry out detoxification  <cit> . therefore, in spite of the inhibitory effect on strain d5a+h, the similarity of the growth rates between the two strains and the shorter lag phase pointed to our d5a+h strain as a possible candidate for further development for industrial fermentations.

the in situ conversion of hmf and furfural by strain d5a+h was clearly superior compared to the parental d5a+ strain and tmb  <dig> . hence, hmf and furfural removal commenced immediately after inoculation due to a comparatively shorter lag phase, and similar to that reported by palmqvist and hahn-hägerdal  <cit> . previous reports identified a range of oxido-reductases as the primary enzymes responsible for the in situ reduction of hmf and furfural to their less toxic alcohol derivatives  <cit> , such as the native reductases adh <dig> and adh <dig>  <cit> . one may, therefore, speculate on enhanced catalytic activity and/or higher degree of expression by one or more of these reductases brought on by mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering of strain d5a+h. less than 12% of the xylose consumed by strain d5a+h was converted to ethanol , which implies accumulation of another metabolite, since the total recovered carbon from biomass, ethanol and glycerol was only 60%. xylitol production has been observed in recombinant s. cerevisiae strains expressing xi and was ascribed to the endogenous activity of non-specific nadph-dependent aldo-ketoreductases expressed from the gre <dig> gene  <cit> . xylitol was not quantified during these fermentations, and future investigations will verify whether xylitol can account for these discrepancies in the carbon mass balance and transcriptomic profiling as well as enzyme activity data is required to validate this hypothesis.

the ability of strain d5a+h to attain high growth rates and a shorter lag phase in spite of the presence of weak organic acids may point to a decreased sensitivity towards anion accumulation. the more abundant organic acids, i.e. acetic and formic acid, also play a pivotal role in contributing to pretreatment liquor toxicity  <cit> . however these acids are typically not reduced in a typically enzyme-mediated manner, as is the case for hmf and furfural  <cit> , but rather accumulate intracellularly in dissociated form due to the neutrality of the cytosol  <cit> . the detoxification profiles show acetic and formic acid  decreasing over time, with the fastest overall removal of these weak acids apparent for strain d5a+h. this observation could probably be related to earlier onset of cell growth. the greater biomass concentration probably resulted in faster diffusion of weak acids down its concentration gradient into the cytoplasm of the yeast cells. although a large proportion of these anions were probably still secreted, this efflux was probably masked by increasing biomass and repetition of the cycle.

strain performance with glucose as carbon source
compared to the parental d5a+ strain in the absence of pretreatment liquor, the influence of inhibitors on the cultures with glucose as carbon source was clearly evident from μmax values that were up to  <dig> -fold lower  and qp values that were up to  <dig> -fold lower . this data clearly illustrated the dramatic negative effect of inhibitors on productivity rates, whereas the biomass and ethanol yield was affected to a much lesser extent and corresponded to data reviewed by liu  <cit> . although strain d5a+h surpassed strains Тmb  <dig>  mh <dig> and mel <dig> in terms of biomass yield and growth rate, this better performance did not correspond to higher ethanol productivity or yield during growth on glucose . the comparatively higher yx/s value of strain d5a+h on glucose could possibly be viewed as a secondary effect of mutagenesis and long term selection, since this trait was not observed in the parental yeast in the absence of pretreatment liquor. on the other hand, strains mh <dig> and mel <dig>  which had comparatively lower μmax values, produced ethanol at a significantly greater rate than strains d5a+h or Тmb <dig>  this result is not surprising, given the robust nature of these yeasts, specifically strain mh <dig>  which was purposefully included due to its high ethanol productivity  <cit> . the by-product detoxification profiles showed that both acetic and formic acid  decreased over time for all the strains. however, once again strain d5a+h outperformed the other strains since approximately 20% more acetic acid was removed than was the case with strain tmb <dig>  this observation supports our previous suggestion of a decreased sensitivity to these acids was brought about through mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering.

practical implementation through simultaneous saccharification and fermentation
whereas our results clearly demonstrated a degree of inhibitor tolerance by strain d5a+h, it is also of industrial importance to evaluate its effectiveness during ssf using steam-treated material. therefore the ability of this strain was assessed along with that of the benchmark strain tmb <dig> . a fed-batch approach was followed, to allow for a higher solids content of 10% , whilst minimising yeast inhibition  <cit> , and viscosity and mass transfer effects. the fed-batch strategy should also further assist in xylose metabolism by limiting the concentration of residual glucose  <cit> . strain d5a+h performed substantially better than strain tmb <dig> in ssf culture with pressed wis, producing 46% more ethanol at a combined  theoretical yield of 50% vs. 34% for strain tmb <dig>  the data recorded for strain d5a+h was slightly below that reported in the literature where ethanol yields from steam-pretreated sorghum ranged between 60-64% of theoretical maximum  <cit> . although xylose was poorly utilised by strain d5a+h in ssf culture, as evident from accumulation of residual xylose , it is possible that the greater ethanol titre produced by strain d5a+h could in part have stemmed from xylose, given the level of ethanol produced by this strain in batch cultures supplemented with hydrolysate and xylose . conversely, a possible explanation for the comparatively poor degree of xylose utilisation observed for the d5a+h strain during ssf could be attributed to residual glucose levels that remained high for a large portion of the total fermentation time, which may have resulted in the inhibition of xylose consumption. high concentrations of glucose are known to inhibit xylose transport in yeast, due to competition between the two substrates for the hexose transporters which have an inherently lower affinity for xylose  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the adaptation of yeast cultures for the production of ethanol from pretreated lignocellulosic substrates is of critical importance due to the toxic nature of the broth after pretreatment. whereas other methods such as recursive breeding and genome shuffling may also be employed to beneficiate multi-allelic traits such as ethanol productivity and inhibitor tolerance  <cit> , the experimental plan followed in this study yielded promising results. therefore, we conclude that mutagenesis in combination with long term evolutionary engineering was successfully applied to introduce a greater level of tolerance in s. cerevisiae d5a+h, together with improved xylose fermentation. to the knowledge of the authors, this is one of very few studies where ems treatment followed by evolutionary engineering at high hydrolysate concentrations with xylose as the sole source of carbon was successfully applied to a strain of s. cerevisiae harbouring the xi pathway for xylose consumption, resulting in comparatively superior performance to a known yeast benchmark. the physiological changes achieved in this study included an improved ability to ferment xylose in the presence of steam pretreated triticale straw liquor in batch culture. future studies will include a second phase of long-term adaptation with emphasis on selection for increased ethanolic fermentation of xylose in the presence of pretreatment liquor, by keeping the fermentation broth strictly anaerobic. additionally, genome sequencing as well as transcriptomic profiling of d5a+h will be focused upon to elucidate the nature of the molecular mechanisms of tolerance inferred through the experimental approaches presented in this study, followed by directed mutagenesis at selected targets using a rational approach.

","evolutionary engineering profoundly affected the yeast metabolism, given that parental strain d5a+ exhibited an oxidative metabolism on xylose prior to strain development.
whereas rational engineering, mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering are established techniques for either improved xylose utilisation or enhancing yeast tolerance, this report focuses on the simultaneous enhancement of these attributes through mutagenesis and evolutionary engineering of saccharomyces cerevisiae harbouring xylose isomerase in anoxic chemostat culture using non-detoxified pretreatment liquor from triticale straw.
following ethyl methanesulfonate  mutagenesis, saccharomyces cerevisiae strain d5a+ , harbouring the xylose isomerase  gene for pentose co-fermentation was grown in anoxic chemostat culture for  <dig> generations at a dilution rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> in a medium consisting of 60%  non-detoxified hydrolysate liquor from steam-pretreated triticale straw, supplemented with 20 g/l xylose as carbon source.
these data support the sequential application of random mutagenesis followed by continuous culture under simultaneous selective pressure from inhibitors and xylose as primary carbon source.

yeasts tolerant to toxic inhibitors from steam-pretreated lignocellulose with xylose co-fermentation capability represent an appealing approach for 2nd generation ethanol production.

"BACKGROUND
plants are being developed as a manufacturing platform for a range of pharmaceutical proteins such as vaccines, hormones and antibodies.
they are attractive for a number of reasons, including low production costs, the ability to assemble and modify multimeric proteins such as monoclonal antibodies  and the ease of scalability.
however, heterologous  proteins often face significant yield losses due to proteolytic breakdown, which has widely been thought to be related to tissue homogenisation and protein extraction.
there are many reports in the literature of degradation patterns manifesting as small fragments in gels and immunoblotting analyses  <cit> .
depending on the primary sequence of the heterologous protein, the number of susceptible sites and their accessibility to plant specific proteases, plant-expressed proteins may undergo complete proteolysis or partial trimming  <cit> .
antibodies are often subject to a significant degree of breakdown with between two to five major species  being reported under non-reducing conditions for different antibodies expressed in nicotiana tabacum leaves  <cit> .
as well as affecting the final yield of target proteins, degradation results in a heterogeneous mixture of recombinant proteins which may alter overall biological activity as well as complicating purification processes  <cit> .
plants produce proteases for a variety of reasons.
proteases are involved in classical biological processes such as plant development, disease resistance, and nutrient remobilisation for reproductive processes  <cit> .
in addition, the timing and levels of protease expression can be viewed as markers for the senescence state of plants  <cit> .
over  <dig> proteases are encoded within the genome of arabidopsis  <cit>  and expressed in various tissues and organelles.
proteases are abundant in various subcellular compartments, including the vacuole  <cit>  and the apoplast  <cit> , the default destination for antibodies targeted to the secretory pathway  <cit> .
it is widely believed that ex vivo degradation of the antibody occurs during the extraction process, as a result of proteases released during tissue and cell disruption  <cit>  and several strategies have been used to minimise this effect  <cit> .
most commonly, protease inhibitors are added to extraction buffers but these are expensive and therefore not economically viable for extraction at large scale.
other methods to prevent degradation of recombinant proteins have been proposed.
attempts to identify and knock out major protease families have met with limited success  <cit> .
alternative approaches include confining expression of proteins to selected cell compartments  <cit> , targeting transgene expression to tissues with low metabolic turnover  <cit> , co-expression of a specific recombinant protease inhibitor  <cit> , or by fusion to stabilising protein domains  <cit> .
these are complicated by the fact that targeted proteases are often important for plant development, the broad spectrum of potential protease targets and compromises resulting from alternative in planta targeting strategies.
the objective of this study was to determine whether antibody degradation in transgenic plants is predominantly an intracellular or extracellular process and to identify whether processes involved in tissue disruption and protein extraction are indeed major contributors to proteolytic degradation of antibodies.
RESULTS
the proteolytic degradation pattern of recombinant mab 2g <dig> extracted from n. tabacum is not significantly affected by protease inhibition
leaf samples from transgenic n. tabacum plants expressing the human igg1κ mab 2g <dig> were extracted in pbs  in the presence or absence of a cocktail of protease inhibitors .
analysis was by western blotting under non-reducing conditions , using igg <dig> heavy chain-specific antiserum  or light chain-specific antiserum  for detection.
a human igg1κ mab, used as a positive control , demonstrates a predominant band at mr 150k  corresponding to fully assembled antibody.
in the plant samples, the corresponding major band was always detected.
a band at a slightly lower molecular weight  was also detected in both anti-gamma and anti-kappa blots .
together with band b  and band d , these were the only major, lower molecular weight species detectable in the anti-gamma blot.
in comparison, at least nine bands of lower molecular weight were observed in the anti-kappa blot  labelled .
since some of these bands have molecular weights greater than mr 25k , the presence of heavy chain fragments is implied, even though no corresponding fragments are observed in the anti-gamma blot.
this was a consistent finding and was also observed when several other human gamma chain-specific antisera were used.
inclusion of a cocktail of protease inhibitors in the extraction buffer did not significantly affect the intensity of the mr 150k band, or the pattern of smaller bands on the western blots .
protein a/g affinity chromatography was used to purify the antibody mixture  from 2g <dig> extracts.
these purified proteins were analysed by coomassie staining of sds-acrylamide gels under reducing conditions .
this figure shows that the fully assembled 2g <dig> antibody and the co-purified lower molecular weight species observed in figure  <dig>  panels a and b resolve into two major bands, one of apparent molecular weight mr ≈ 55k and the other with mr ≈ 25k .
the relative molecular weights of these two species, particularly when compared with the free heavy and light chains in the reduced positive control  provide evidence that these 2g <dig> plant-derived bands are free heavy and free light chains.
this is supported by their immunoreactivity with human fc fragment-specific antiserum  or human kappa chain-specific antiserum .
in addition, five breakdown fragments  are also observed.
two of these fragments  appear to correspond to bands seen in the coomassie-stained gel.
fragments b , c  and e  could only be detected with the human fc-specific antiserum .
band d  was only reactive with the kappa chain-specific antiserum .
n. tabacum leaf extracts at neutral ph exhibit little proteolytic activity against igg
the presence of the majority of immunoglobulin fragments in plant extracts prepared with protease inhibitor cocktail suggested that proteolytic degradation might occur predominantly in planta prior to extraction.
in order to investigate the influence of proteases released during the extraction process, we used nicotiana tabacum leaf extracts from non-transgenic plants, prepared in either pbs  or pbs supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail, to which a standard amount of a human igg1κ mab was added.
samples were incubated for either  <dig> mins,  <dig> hrs or  <dig> hrs at room temperature and analysed by western blotting , using an anti-gamma chain antiserum  or anti-kappa chain antiserum .
the commercial mab preparation consists of a predominant single band  at the expected mr of ≈ 180k .
the smaller fragments  were also evident in both anti-heavy and anti-light chain blots.
this pattern of bands was not significantly affected by incubation with the tobacco extract for up to  <dig> hrs.
the intensities of these bands did not vary over time.
moreover, the addition of the cocktail of protease inhibitors had no significant effect at any of the time points.
a faint band  was observed on some blots due to specific blotting conditions.
this band is unlikely to be the result of proteolytic degradation in the plant extract as it is also present in the positive control lanes in figure  <dig> panels a-c.
igg proteolysis by tobacco plant extracts is activated at acidic ph
in the next experiment, the influence of extraction buffer ph on the proteolytic activity of n. tabacum leaf extracts was investigated.
leaf tissue was extracted in buffers at different ph and incubated at room temperature with exogenous human igg.
samples were taken after  <dig> mins,  <dig> hrs or  <dig> hrs and analysed by sds-page and western blotting using an anti-gamma chain antiserum .
the results showed that at ph >  <dig>  there was no significant change in the intensity of the intact igg .
the smaller bands a, b and c  did not alter in intensity with decreasing ph.
this is true for all the time points investigated .
at ph  <dig>  the intensity of band a increased at all three time points.
when the ph was reduced further to  <dig>  or  <dig>  a dramatic loss of immunoreactive material occurred, even at the  <dig> mins time point.
in order to verify whether phs <  <dig> might be responsible for the activation of proteases present in n. tabacum leaf extracts, we compared igg samples that were incubated with plant extracts at ph  <dig> , ph  <dig>  or ph  <dig>  in the presence or absence of a protease inhibitor cocktail.
samples were incubated for  <dig> hrs and analysed by western blotting using an anti-human fc antiserum  or anti-human light chain antiserum .
in the absence of protease inhibitors, no significant degradation was seen at ph  <dig> , but extensive antibody degradation was observed at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  as before.
however, addition of the protease inhibitor cocktail almost completely abrogated the antibody loss at low ph.
as ph affected the proteolytic activity of tobacco leaf extracts on exogenous igg, the effect of extraction buffer ph on mab 2g <dig> expressed in transgenic plants was examined.
leaf discs were extracted in different ph buffers as before and incubated for  <dig> mins or  <dig> hrs at room temperature.
samples were analysed by sds-page and western blotting.
immunoreactive bands were detected with anti-kappa antiserum .
recombinant antibody extracted under these conditions was already extensively degraded, as previously observed in figure  <dig>  but between ph 5- <dig>  there was little difference between the analysed samples, either after  <dig> mins  or  <dig> hrs incubation .
at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  there was extensive degradation of the antibody.
interestingly, the loss of intact igg is not associated with the appearance of new degradation bands or increased intensity of existing degradation products, rather it appears that there is complete loss of immunoreactivity of all bands.
analysis of mab 2g <dig> fragments and secretion in transgenic plant cells
protoplasts prepared from mab 2g <dig> transgenic plants were pulse-labelled for  <dig> mins, and subsequently chased following the addition of cold amino acids over a period of  <dig> hours.
during the chase, samples were taken at  <dig> hrs,  <dig> hour,  <dig> hrs and  <dig> hrs, immunoprecipitated and visualised by sds-page and auto-radiography to investigate secretion and degradation of mab 2g <dig> under non-reducing conditions  and reducing conditions .
intact mab 2g <dig>  was identified in the protoplasts at  <dig> hrs.
the amount of intact mab diminished with time inside the protoplasts, concomitant with a gradual increase in full length mab in the medium.
this indicates efficient secretion of mab 2g <dig>  as has been described previously for another mab  <cit> .
the characteristic pattern of smaller species  was observed in the cellular samples.
three of these bands  decreased in intensity over time, whereas others seemed to be stable within the cell .
the result suggests that fully assembled mab 2g <dig> is efficiently secreted from transgenic plant cells, while smaller immunoreactive species of mab 2g <dig> are present intracellularly, remain in the cell and are not secreted, with the exception of band d which was visible after  <dig> hrs chase in the medium.
under reducing conditions  free heavy chain  and free light chain  were the only bands detected by radiolabelling.
to establish the pattern of antibody bands within the cells under steady state conditions, unlabelled protoplasts were prepared from leaf tissue of two month old transgenic plants expressing mab 2g <dig> and analysed by sds-page and western blotting under non-reducing  and reducing conditions .
for each condition, these results were compared to the pattern obtained from a crude extract of the same leaf material.
at steady state, free heavy or light chain were again the only bands detected under reducing conditions within the cells, whereas several additional fragments could be observed in the crude extract.
the presence of bands that did not correspond to assembly intermediates was also apparent in the non-reduced crude sample .
discussion
many recombinant mabs extracted from transgenic plants demonstrate a characteristic and reproducible pattern of fragmentation.
such a pattern was observed in the mab 2g <dig> plants studied here.
despite findings which show that recombinant protein degradation occurs in vivo  <cit> , the possibility that degradation fragments are formed as a result of proteases that are activated during plant cell and tissue disruption cannot be excluded  <cit> .
as a consequence, it is routine practice to include a range of protease inhibitors in extraction buffers.
however, the efficacy of protease inhibitors has never been proven, furthermore they are frequently expensive and unlikely to be practical for commercial scale up.
the identity of the igg fragments has also not yet been determined.
whilst some may represent assembly intermediates of igg , these cannot account for all of the fragments observed.
indeed, when analysed under reducing conditions , fragments with a lower molecular weight than the free heavy and free light chains were observed and these can only be due to degradation.
based on the data presented, tentative assignments have been made for each of the bands observed in figure 1b.
species which correspond to bands present in the protoplast preparation  are likely to be assembly intermediates , as no other fragments were observed in protoplasts under reducing conditions.
band g shares a molecular weight  with a species previously described as a degradation fragment   <cit> .
this possibility cannot be excluded as the predicted mobility of both components of a reduced fab-like fragment matches that of the light chain.
bands c, e, f and h in figure 1b were present only in the plant tissue extract , and are likely to originate in the apoplastic space as they were not affected by the addition of protease inhibitor  and are not apparent in the protoplast preparation .
the loss of plant-expressed antibodies due to proteolytic degradation ex planta and in planta is a major concern regarding stability, final yield of plant-expressed mabs and validation of purification.
development of strategies to prevent proteolytic degradation of plant-expressed antibodies would therefore be a worthwhile consideration, so it is important to understand when and where this degradation occurs.
non-transgenic n. tabacum leaf extracts have little or no anti-igg proteolytic activity in the ph range commonly used for experimental extraction.
in addition, the use of a broad acting cocktail of protease inhibitors at high concentration had little effect on the igg fragment pattern for mab 2g <dig>  these findings suggest that degradation of mab 2g <dig> is not related to the process of extraction, more likely, degradation occurs before extraction, and either along the secretory pathway, in the apoplastic space, or in subcellular storage compartments  <cit> .
these observations support the findings of hassan et al.
<cit>  who showed little benefit from using protease inhibitors during the extraction of a murine igg1κ at neutral ph to prevent the loss of functional mab.
endoproteases that can degrade monoclonal antibodies are undoubtedly released during the extraction process  <cit> , but significant proteolytic activity was only observed here at ph <  <dig> and in this instance, degradation could be countered by the protease inhibitor cocktail.
at low ph, degradation of igg is characterised by a complete loss of mab, rather than the appearance of new, smaller species.
an explanation for this phenomenon could be that plant proteases active in acidic conditions  may show extensive activity on antibody fc regions, degrading it to smaller peptides  <cit> .
kim et al.
<cit>  suggested that under acidic conditions  a conformational change in the fc region of an igg takes place, which makes the antibody more accessible to proteases.
the organelles of the early secretory pathway are the sites of initial polypeptide folding and maturation.
given these roles, the luminal compartments of these organelles are not widely recognised as possessing broad-spectrum proteolytic activity.
the established paradigm for 'quality control' in the er consists of prolonged association with er-resident chaperones, n-glycan modification, retrotranslocation and complete degradation by the proteasome in the cytosol  <cit> .
alternative routes for luminal disposal of proteins that fail to mature have been mooted, either through trafficking in a complex with bip to the vacuole  <cit>  or via an er subdomain rich in proteases  <cit> .
it is important to remember that antibodies have not evolved in the context of the plant protease degradome, and they could therefore represent novel targets for plant proteases  <cit> .
however, previous studies on transgenic tobacco tissue have shown that by blocking early transport events in the secretory pathway, and thereby causing an accumulation of antibody in an er-golgi super-compartment, the accumulation of intact mouse igg <dig> mab could in fact be markedly improved  <cit> .
high levels of intact recombinant protein have been reported to accumulate in er-derived compartments, such as protein bodies  <cit> .
here, we have shown that igg-expressing protoplasts do not accumulate mab proteolytic fragments when analysed at steady state.
furthermore, a discrete pulse of expression analysed over a 4-hour chase period revealed no species that did not correspond to the predicted mobility of an igg assembly intermediate.
hence, it would appear unlikely that discrete intracellular proteolytic fragments are not detectable at steady state due to rapid clearance through further degradation.
in similar pulse-chase experiments, hadlington et al.
describe the formation of fragments characteristic of vacuolar proteolysis when a hybrid murine mab with both gamma and alpha constant regions was expressed in protoplasts  <cit> .
these fragments were not observed in our experiments.
over the course of the chase, several smaller species are lost from the protoplasts apparently without fragmentation or secretion into the medium, which suggests that a significant proportion of igg tetramers undergo a delayed assembly.
the cause of this slow assembly is unclear, although it has been reported that an excess of light chain may be required for efficient release of heavy chain from the heat shock protein  <dig>  family chaperone bip  <cit> , and no attempt was made here to optimise the stoichiometry of the components.
in contrast to the secretory pathway, the apoplast is a likely compartment for the formation and accumulation of the proteolytic fragments observed in these experiments.
the ph of apoplastic fluid is between ph 5- <dig>  <cit> .
the apoplastic space is regarded to be rich in acidic proteases  <cit>  and a number of candidate proteases have been identified.
secretion of six proteases into the leaf apoplastic space of different plant species , belonging to the cysteine protease , aspartic protease  and serine protease  families has been reported  <cit> .
seventeen peptides corresponding to predicted plant aspartic, cysteine, and serine proteases were identified from zymography of intercellular fluid from n. tabacum  <cit> .
a plasma membrane associated metalloproteinase has recently been reported in tobacco cells  <cit> , and a member of the legumain asn-specific cysteine endopeptidase family has also been described in the plant cell wall  <cit> .
CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the fragmentation pattern of heterologously expressed mab in n. tabacum is not primarily due to proteolysis arising during extraction unless acidic extraction buffers are used.
instead, the fragmentation pattern observed when samples are subjected to sds-page under reducing conditions appears to reflect in planta proteolysis, and this activity was restricted to the apoplast rather than the cells.
if this is the case, it is unlikely that any extraction strategy that utilises exogenous measures to control proteolytic degradation will have a significant effect.
measures aimed at preventing degradation of igg within the apoplastic space have the potential to increase yield and homogeneity of this important class of molecule and need to be explored further.
",526,"BACKGROUND
plants are being developed as a manufacturing platform for a range of pharmaceutical proteins such as vaccines, hormones and antibodies. they are attractive for a number of reasons, including low production costs, the ability to assemble and modify multimeric proteins such as monoclonal antibodies  and the ease of scalability. however, heterologous  proteins often face significant yield losses due to proteolytic breakdown, which has widely been thought to be related to tissue homogenisation and protein extraction. there are many reports in the literature of degradation patterns manifesting as small fragments in gels and immunoblotting analyses  <cit> . depending on the primary sequence of the heterologous protein, the number of susceptible sites and their accessibility to plant specific proteases, plant-expressed proteins may undergo complete proteolysis or partial trimming  <cit> . antibodies are often subject to a significant degree of breakdown with between two to five major species  being reported under non-reducing conditions for different antibodies expressed in nicotiana tabacum leaves  <cit> . as well as affecting the final yield of target proteins, degradation results in a heterogeneous mixture of recombinant proteins which may alter overall biological activity as well as complicating purification processes  <cit> .

plants produce proteases for a variety of reasons. proteases are involved in classical biological processes such as plant development, disease resistance, and nutrient remobilisation for reproductive processes  <cit> . in addition, the timing and levels of protease expression can be viewed as markers for the senescence state of plants  <cit> . over  <dig> proteases are encoded within the genome of arabidopsis  <cit>  and expressed in various tissues and organelles. proteases are abundant in various subcellular compartments, including the vacuole  <cit>  and the apoplast  <cit> , the default destination for antibodies targeted to the secretory pathway  <cit> .

it is widely believed that ex vivo degradation of the antibody occurs during the extraction process, as a result of proteases released during tissue and cell disruption  <cit>  and several strategies have been used to minimise this effect  <cit> . most commonly, protease inhibitors are added to extraction buffers but these are expensive and therefore not economically viable for extraction at large scale. other methods to prevent degradation of recombinant proteins have been proposed. attempts to identify and knock out major protease families have met with limited success  <cit> . alternative approaches include confining expression of proteins to selected cell compartments  <cit> , targeting transgene expression to tissues with low metabolic turnover  <cit> , co-expression of a specific recombinant protease inhibitor  <cit> , or by fusion to stabilising protein domains  <cit> . these are complicated by the fact that targeted proteases are often important for plant development, the broad spectrum of potential protease targets and compromises resulting from alternative in planta targeting strategies.

the objective of this study was to determine whether antibody degradation in transgenic plants is predominantly an intracellular or extracellular process and to identify whether processes involved in tissue disruption and protein extraction are indeed major contributors to proteolytic degradation of antibodies.

RESULTS
the proteolytic degradation pattern of recombinant mab 2g <dig> extracted from n. tabacum is not significantly affected by protease inhibition
leaf samples from transgenic n. tabacum plants expressing the human igg1κ mab 2g <dig> were extracted in pbs  in the presence or absence of a cocktail of protease inhibitors . analysis was by western blotting under non-reducing conditions , using igg <dig> heavy chain-specific antiserum  or light chain-specific antiserum  for detection. a human igg1κ mab, used as a positive control , demonstrates a predominant band at mr 150k  corresponding to fully assembled antibody. in the plant samples, the corresponding major band was always detected. a band at a slightly lower molecular weight  was also detected in both anti-gamma and anti-kappa blots . together with band b  and band d , these were the only major, lower molecular weight species detectable in the anti-gamma blot. in comparison, at least nine bands of lower molecular weight were observed in the anti-kappa blot  labelled . since some of these bands have molecular weights greater than mr 25k , the presence of heavy chain fragments is implied, even though no corresponding fragments are observed in the anti-gamma blot. this was a consistent finding and was also observed when several other human gamma chain-specific antisera were used. inclusion of a cocktail of protease inhibitors in the extraction buffer did not significantly affect the intensity of the mr 150k band, or the pattern of smaller bands on the western blots .

protein a/g affinity chromatography was used to purify the antibody mixture  from 2g <dig> extracts. these purified proteins were analysed by coomassie staining of sds-acrylamide gels under reducing conditions . this figure shows that the fully assembled 2g <dig> antibody and the co-purified lower molecular weight species observed in figure  <dig>  panels a and b resolve into two major bands, one of apparent molecular weight mr ≈ 55k and the other with mr ≈ 25k . the relative molecular weights of these two species, particularly when compared with the free heavy and light chains in the reduced positive control  provide evidence that these 2g <dig> plant-derived bands are free heavy and free light chains. this is supported by their immunoreactivity with human fc fragment-specific antiserum  or human kappa chain-specific antiserum . in addition, five breakdown fragments  are also observed. two of these fragments  appear to correspond to bands seen in the coomassie-stained gel. fragments b , c  and e  could only be detected with the human fc-specific antiserum . band d  was only reactive with the kappa chain-specific antiserum .

n. tabacum leaf extracts at neutral ph exhibit little proteolytic activity against igg
the presence of the majority of immunoglobulin fragments in plant extracts prepared with protease inhibitor cocktail suggested that proteolytic degradation might occur predominantly in planta prior to extraction. in order to investigate the influence of proteases released during the extraction process, we used nicotiana tabacum leaf extracts from non-transgenic plants, prepared in either pbs  or pbs supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail, to which a standard amount of a human igg1κ mab was added. samples were incubated for either  <dig> mins,  <dig> hrs or  <dig> hrs at room temperature and analysed by western blotting , using an anti-gamma chain antiserum  or anti-kappa chain antiserum .

the commercial mab preparation consists of a predominant single band  at the expected mr of ≈ 180k . the smaller fragments  were also evident in both anti-heavy and anti-light chain blots.

this pattern of bands was not significantly affected by incubation with the tobacco extract for up to  <dig> hrs. the intensities of these bands did not vary over time. moreover, the addition of the cocktail of protease inhibitors had no significant effect at any of the time points. a faint band  was observed on some blots due to specific blotting conditions. this band is unlikely to be the result of proteolytic degradation in the plant extract as it is also present in the positive control lanes in figure  <dig> panels a-c.

igg proteolysis by tobacco plant extracts is activated at acidic ph
in the next experiment, the influence of extraction buffer ph on the proteolytic activity of n. tabacum leaf extracts was investigated. leaf tissue was extracted in buffers at different ph and incubated at room temperature with exogenous human igg. samples were taken after  <dig> mins,  <dig> hrs or  <dig> hrs and analysed by sds-page and western blotting using an anti-gamma chain antiserum . the results showed that at ph >  <dig>  there was no significant change in the intensity of the intact igg . the smaller bands a, b and c  did not alter in intensity with decreasing ph. this is true for all the time points investigated . at ph  <dig>  the intensity of band a increased at all three time points. when the ph was reduced further to  <dig>  or  <dig>  a dramatic loss of immunoreactive material occurred, even at the  <dig> mins time point.

in order to verify whether phs <  <dig> might be responsible for the activation of proteases present in n. tabacum leaf extracts, we compared igg samples that were incubated with plant extracts at ph  <dig> , ph  <dig>  or ph  <dig>  in the presence or absence of a protease inhibitor cocktail. samples were incubated for  <dig> hrs and analysed by western blotting using an anti-human fc antiserum  or anti-human light chain antiserum . in the absence of protease inhibitors, no significant degradation was seen at ph  <dig> , but extensive antibody degradation was observed at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  as before. however, addition of the protease inhibitor cocktail almost completely abrogated the antibody loss at low ph.

as ph affected the proteolytic activity of tobacco leaf extracts on exogenous igg, the effect of extraction buffer ph on mab 2g <dig> expressed in transgenic plants was examined. leaf discs were extracted in different ph buffers as before and incubated for  <dig> mins or  <dig> hrs at room temperature. samples were analysed by sds-page and western blotting. immunoreactive bands were detected with anti-kappa antiserum . recombinant antibody extracted under these conditions was already extensively degraded, as previously observed in figure  <dig>  but between ph 5- <dig>  there was little difference between the analysed samples, either after  <dig> mins  or  <dig> hrs incubation . at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  there was extensive degradation of the antibody. interestingly, the loss of intact igg is not associated with the appearance of new degradation bands or increased intensity of existing degradation products, rather it appears that there is complete loss of immunoreactivity of all bands.

analysis of mab 2g <dig> fragments and secretion in transgenic plant cells
protoplasts prepared from mab 2g <dig> transgenic plants were pulse-labelled for  <dig> mins, and subsequently chased following the addition of cold amino acids over a period of  <dig> hours. during the chase, samples were taken at  <dig> hrs,  <dig> hour,  <dig> hrs and  <dig> hrs, immunoprecipitated and visualised by sds-page and auto-radiography to investigate secretion and degradation of mab 2g <dig> under non-reducing conditions  and reducing conditions . intact mab 2g <dig>  was identified in the protoplasts at  <dig> hrs. the amount of intact mab diminished with time inside the protoplasts, concomitant with a gradual increase in full length mab in the medium. this indicates efficient secretion of mab 2g <dig>  as has been described previously for another mab  <cit> . the characteristic pattern of smaller species  was observed in the cellular samples. three of these bands  decreased in intensity over time, whereas others seemed to be stable within the cell . the result suggests that fully assembled mab 2g <dig> is efficiently secreted from transgenic plant cells, while smaller immunoreactive species of mab 2g <dig> are present intracellularly, remain in the cell and are not secreted, with the exception of band d which was visible after  <dig> hrs chase in the medium. under reducing conditions  free heavy chain  and free light chain  were the only bands detected by radiolabelling.

to establish the pattern of antibody bands within the cells under steady state conditions, unlabelled protoplasts were prepared from leaf tissue of two month old transgenic plants expressing mab 2g <dig> and analysed by sds-page and western blotting under non-reducing  and reducing conditions . for each condition, these results were compared to the pattern obtained from a crude extract of the same leaf material. at steady state, free heavy or light chain were again the only bands detected under reducing conditions within the cells, whereas several additional fragments could be observed in the crude extract. the presence of bands that did not correspond to assembly intermediates was also apparent in the non-reduced crude sample .

"BACKGROUND
introduction of mass spectrometry  provides massive biological information of proteins for both qualitative and quantitative analysis  <cit> .
recently, quantitative analyses have become of particular interest in proteomics research  <cit> .
to determine the expressional differences of proteins across samples representing different physiological or disease states, various experimental approaches have been developed: spectral counting, stable isotope labeling, and label-free quantification  <cit> .
stable isotope labeling is one of popular methods for protein quantification.
peptides of two or more samples are differently labeled using stable isotopes to introduce mass shifts.
then they are experimented within a single lc/ms run, so that the sample throughput could be multiplied when compared with that of label-free quantification.
there are various labeling techniques: icat  <cit> , silac  <cit> , 18o labelling  <cit> , itraq  <cit> , mtraq  <cit> , and so on.
numerous computational tools for the stable isotope labeling have also been developed, including xpress  <cit> , asapratio  <cit> , stem  <cit> , zoomquant  <cit> , msinspect  <cit> , multi-q  <cit> , q <dig>  <cit> , viper  <cit> , maxquant  <cit> , census  <cit> , and iemm  <cit> .
in this paper, we focus on the isotope label mtraq, which is a nonisobaric variant of the itraq and was originally designed for multiple reaction monitoring   <cit> .
the mtraq labels were first designed in two chemically identical versions.
the heavy-label is identical to the itraq  <dig> label and its mass is  <dig> da.
the light-label is chemically identical to the heavy-label, but it has no 13c or 15n, so its mass is  <dig> da.
they are labeled at lysine residue and n-terminal.
we verified that the mtraq is a powerful isotope label for ms-based relative quantification  <cit> , and developed a new algorithm to improve the accuracy of peptide quantification in mtraq labeling based ms experiments  <cit> .
recently, the mtraq has become available in triplex format, where the label with  <dig> da is added.
one of the major obstacles to accurate peptide quantification is the overlap of isotopic clusters.
there are two types of overlap problems, one is the overlap between differently labeled peptides, and the other is the overlap between chemically different peptides.
the former can happen when the mass difference between labels is very small.
in mtraq experiments, the mass difference between differently labeled peptides is  <dig> da if the original peptide has no lysine, so it is important to separate their isotopic clusters correctly.
the latter could be found in all kinds of ms-based experiments.
for peptide quantification, most of the times we are interested in relative quantification of peptides whose amino acid sequences are known.
when we know the sequences of peptides of interest, there are better chances to recognize the overlaps from differential labeling by comparing them to the theoretical isotopic distributions.
in this manuscript, we present a new data analysis algorithm for peptide quantification in triplex mtraq experiments.
it is an extension of the algorithm for duplex mtraq experiments  <cit> .
we identify isotopic clusters of triplex labeled peptides and separate their intensities using cubic equation modelling when there are overlaps.
we also designed an automatic determination algorithm for the elution area of peptides, which could recognize the overlap between chemically different peptides.
we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm using standard protein mixture experiments.
materials and methods
preparation of standard samples
three kinds of standard protein mixtures  were prepared for mtraq quantification testing by mixing  <dig> bovine proteins.
each mixture consisted of alpha-lactalbumin , beta-casein , serotransferrin , alpha-s1-casein , alpha-s2-casein , cytochrome c  and beta-lactoglobulin  in  <dig> mm tris ph  <dig>  at different amounts as summarized in table  <dig>
mtraq labeling
the standard protein mixtures were labeled with mtraqtm reagent  as described in  <cit>  and  <cit> .
proteins were reduced with  <dig> mm tris  phosphine  for  <dig> hr at  <dig> °c, treated with  <dig> mm methyl methanethiosulfonate  for  <dig> min at  <dig> °c, and then diluted  <dig> fold with  <dig> mm tris , and digested with sequencing-grade trypsin  at  <dig> °c overnight at the protein:trypsin molar ratio of 40: <dig>  tryptic digests were desalted with c <dig> solid-phase extraction cartridge and dried in vacuo.
the dried samples were reconstituted in  <dig> mm triethylammonium bicarbonate  and incubated with appropriate mtraq reagents at  <dig> °c for  <dig> hr.
for the set <dig> experiment, std <dig> was labeled with mtraq® ∆ <dig> , std <dig> with mtraq® ∆ <dig> , and std <dig> with mtraq® ∆ <dig> .
for the set <dig> experiment, std <dig> was labeled with heavy reagent, std <dig> with medium, and std <dig> with light .
after the labeling reaction, samples were dried in vacuo, redissolved in  <dig> % trifluoroacetic acid, mixed equally, desalted with a mixed-mode strong cation-exchange  cartridge and dried again.
mass spectrometric analyses of mtraq labeled samples
labeled sample mixtures were reconstituted in  <dig> % acetic acid and an aliquot  was injected to a reversed-phase magic c18aq column  on an eksigent multi-dimensional liquid chromatography  system at the flow rate of  <dig> nl/min.
the column was equilibrated with 95% buffer a  +  <dig> % buffer b  prior to use.
the peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of  <dig> to 40% buffer b over  <dig> min.
the high performance liquid chromatography  system was coupled to a linear trap quadrupole  xl-orbitrap mass spectrometer .
the spray voltage was set to  <dig>  kv, and the temperature of the heated capillary was set to  <dig> °c.
survey full-scan ms spectra  were acquired in the orbitrap with  <dig> microscan and a resolution of  <dig>  allowing the preview mode for precursor selection and charge-state determination.
ms/ms spectra of the five most intense ions from the preview survey scan were acquired in the ion-trap concurrently with full-scan acquisition in the orbitrap with the following options: isolation width, ± <dig> ppm; normalized collision energy, 35%; dynamic exclusion duration,  <dig> sec.
precursors with unmatched and single charge states were discarded during data dependant acquisition.

<dig> .
database searching of ms/ms data for peptide identification
the data files collected on the mass spectrometer  were converted to mgf format by use of trans-proteomic pipeline , which is an open source proteomics analysis tool.
the data were then searched using mascot  <cit>   against a compound database consisting of the international protein index  bovine database  and ipi human database  totaling  <dig>  protein entries, allowing the options of trypsin, ± <dig>  da mass tolerance for fragment ion, ± <dig> ppm mass tolerance for precursor ion, variable modifications of mtraq light , mtraq medium  and mtraq heavy  on peptide n-terminus and lys residue.
a fixed modification of mmts  on cys residue and a variable modification of met oxidation  were also allowed.
tpp was used for the validation of database search results.
peptides with tpp peptide probability greater  <dig>  and mascot e-value less than  <dig>  were used for further quantification analysis.
overview of the algorithm
our algorithm is designed to be executed within tpp.
for each lc/ms experiment, tpp generates a pepxml file which contains a list of peptides with sequences, tandem scans, charges, and modifications.
our algorithm calculates medium to light  and heavy to light  ratios of peptides in pepxml files and produces new pepxml files that can be used for further analysis.
for each peptide, our algorithm first determines its elution area.
it then identifies triplex isotopic clusters and calculates m/l and h/l ratios for each ms scan contained in the elution area.
finally, each of the set of m/l and h/l ratios is integrated based on linear regression.
model of overlapping isotopic clusters
we made a schematic model of overlapping triplex isotopic clusters, which is an extension of the model in our previous work   <cit> .
we assumed that an isotopic cluster of a peptide has  <dig> or less peaks.
such an assumption is reasonable for peptides whose masses are less than  <dig> da because the relative intensity of the ninth peak in the theoretical distribution of a  <dig> da peptide is only  <dig> % according to an averagine model  <cit> .
under this assumption, an overlap exists only if a peptide has no lysine.
in this case, the mass difference between labeled peptides is  <dig> da, thus the intensity of the kth peak ik is given as follows:
where n is the number of peaks in the isotopic distribution of a peptide, lk, mk, and hk are the intensities of the kth peaks of the isotopic distributions of the light, medium, and heavy-labeled peptides, respectively.
let α be the m/l ratio and β be the h/l ratio.
for  <dig> ≤ k ≤  <dig>  it is easy to show
from equation .
using equation , we induced three equations
from equations  and , we obtain a cubic equation for β:
solving equation , we obtain up to three candidate values for β. then, by substituting the candidates into equation  and solving it, we obtain up to two candidate values for α.  may lead to an abnormal α value because ik+ <dig> could possibly be very small and inaccurate in its value.
substituting into equation  could also be problematic because a small value of β could cause an inaccurate α value.)
to select the most accurate ratio pair, we define an error function as follows:
where tk is the intensity of the kth peak of the theoretical isotopic distribution of the peptide.
the error value should be very small for the correct ratio pair because lk+4/lk, mk+4/mk, and hk+4/hk are theoretically the same as tk+4/tk.
therefore, we calculated the error value for each candidate pair and select the pair with the lowest error value.
after all pairs for  <dig> ≤ k ≤  <dig> are selected, we can calculate the m/l ratio  and the h/l ratio .
determination of the elution areas of peptides
in most lc/ms experiments, tandem ms scans are acquired using dynamic exclusion .
for each ms/ms scan, therefore, we know only one ms scan where the identified peptide is eluted.
we need to determine the elution area of the peptide as it is eluted over a period of time.
however, some peptides have similar atomic masses and elution times, so their elution areas can have overlaps.
a naive approach such as using a fixed range  has a risk of including incorrect ms scans where other peptides are overlapped.
therefore, it is very important to determine accurate elution areas of the peptides for accurate relative quantification.
we assume that the distribution of peptide elution time can be approximated as a normal distribution.
because of noise and overlap of peptides, ms scans with low intensities at both ends of the elution area may not be trusted.
if we use only ms scans with high total ion current while modeling the elution profile as a normal distribution, the mean μ of the normal distribution can be approximated, but the variance σ <dig> can’t.
instead, we use the full width at half maximum  to induce σ <dig>  from the probability density function of the normal distribution, we deduce  and obtain σ <dig> = fwhm2/ <dig> ln  <dig>
when a peptide identification and the associated tandem ms scan is given, our algorithm first finds the maximum point of the peptide’s elution profile.
for each ms scan within ±30s range from the given tandem scan, it identifies triplex isotopic clusters and calculates the sum of intensities.
the ms scan whose sum of intensities is the highest is selected as the maximum point of the elution area.
then it extends the elution area while the sum of intensities of ms scan is above a half of that of the maximum point.
the length of the extended area is used as fwhm and weighted average time of scans in the extended area is used as μ. the area with higher intensities than 10% of the maximum intensity in the normal distribution  is used as the elution area of a peptide.
an example for approximation to normal distribution is shown in figure  <dig>
our algorithm calculates m/l and h/l ratios for all ms scans in the elution area.
then, each of the set of m/l and h/l ratios is integrated by linear regression using the form “y = cx”.
the intensities of peaks are split into the intensity of light-, medium-, and heavy-labeled peptide.
we estimate c using the set of intensities of light-labeled peptides as xi’s, and the set of intensities of medium- and heavy-labeled peptides as yi’s for m/l and h/l ratios, respectively.
identification and validation of triplex isotopic clusters
for each ms scan in the elution area, our algorithm identifies isotopic clusters of a target peptide.
let mzk be the m/z of the kth peak of an isotopic cluster, then we can calculate three mz1’s corresponding to triplex isotopic clusters from the given sequence, charge z, and modification.
our algorithm first finds the monoisotopic peak of each isotopic cluster from mz <dig> within  <dig> ppm error tolerance.
then, it finds subsequent isotopic peaks from mzk = mzk-1+  <dig> /z within  <dig> ppm error tolerance.
the kth peak is inserted to the isotopic cluster only if the peak improves the least squares fit value .
if the lsq between the theoretical distribution of the peptide and the isotopic cluster without the kth peak is lower than that with the kth peak, the kth peak is discarded and the algorithm does not look for any more peaks.
if there are two or more candidate peaks for the kth peak, the peak with the lowest lsq is selected.
for example, there are two candidates for the third isotopic peak of the light-labeled isotopic cluster of the target peptide and the smaller peak is selected in figure 3a.
after identification of triplex isotopic clusters of a target peptide, we check them and discard the current ms scan if they are doubtful according to the following criteria.
first, we check whether the overall shape of each isotopic cluster resembles that of a theoretical isotopic distribution.
at least the lsq of the most abundant isotopic cluster must be below a threshold .
the lsq of the others should also be below the threshold unless their sums of intensities are lower than a half of that of the most abundant isotopic cluster.
second, we check whether the identified isotopic cluster is overlapped with another peptide.
four types of overlaps are shown in figure  <dig>  there is no problem if no isotopic peak is shared by two isotopic clusters .
if an isotopic cluster with a different charge value is overlapped, the lsq of the identified isotopic cluster should be significantly high, so we can discard the current ms scan .
if an isotopic cluster with the same charge and a higher mass is overlapped, shared isotopic peaks could not be inserted to the isotopic cluster of the target peptide because it increases the lsq of the isotopic cluster .
only the case in which an isotopic cluster with the same charge and a lower mass is overlapped needs additional filtering .
we can easily detect these overlaps by considering previous peaks, but we can’t separate overlapping isotopic clusters in this case because they look like one isotopic cluster.
therefore, we discard the current ms scan if at least one isotopic cluster of a target peptide could be identified as an isotopic cluster with the same charge and a lower mass.
RESULTS
application to 7-standard protein data mixed with known ratios
we analyzed two datasets in which seven standard proteins were mixed in different ratios.
for the set <dig> experiment, std <dig> was labeled with light, std <dig> with medium, and std <dig> with heavy.
for the set <dig> experiment, std <dig> was labeled with heavy, std <dig> with medium, and std <dig> with light.
the expected ratios for each experiment are shown in table  <dig>
we first calculated the averages and standard deviations of log <dig> values of peptides.
then, we transformed the averages into h/l scale to compare them to expected ratios.
after validation, we obtained  <dig> ms/ms scans from set <dig> and  <dig> ms/ms scans from set <dig>  resulting in  <dig> unique peptides in total.
we calculated m/l and h/l ratios of the peptides and classified them according to the proteins.
then we calculated the averages of ratios in individual cases and compared them to the expected ratios .
the m/l ratios were generally similar to the expected ratios except csn <dig> and csn1s <dig>  whose ratios were somewhat higher than expected ratios.
most h/l ratios were somewhat lower than the expected ratios, but their standard deviations are meaningfully small.
we manually inspected the isotopic clusters of these peptides and concluded that the computed ratios are certainly correct despite their discrepancy from the expected ratios.
some examples of these cases are shown in figure  <dig>  in spite of our effort to label the samples and to mix them accurately, the mixed ratios of samples may deviate from the expected ratio because of different labeling efficiencies between the labels, and experimental errors such as unequal mixing.
average ratio and standard deviation are the two parameters that determine the accuracy of our quantification analysis.
unlike the average ratio that is very sensitive to such errors, standard deviation is more inert because the ratios originated from peptides of the same protein should be identical in theory.
therefore, the low standard deviations give strong evidence that our computed ratios were accurately determined.
figure  <dig> shows the distribution of ratios for lalba.
each of m/l and h/l ratios represent similar values.
the distributions of ratios for the other proteins are given in supplementary figure s <dig> – in additional file  <dig>
separation of overlapping triplex isotopic clusters
to verify the robustness of our method for the overlap of triplex isotopic clusters, we prepared set <dig> experiment, in which std <dig> with light and std <dig> with heavy were mixed.
in the set <dig> experiment, two isotopic clusters originated from the same peptide have no overlap and their relative ratio can be computed accurately even though the peptide has no lysine.
therefore, we can show the robustness of our method by comparing the h/l ratios from the set <dig> experiment to those from the set <dig> experiment.
fifteen unique peptides were identified in both experiments and their h/l ratios are shown in figure  <dig>  the h/l ratios in the set <dig> experiment were very close to the h/l ratios in the set <dig> experiment in spite of the interference of the medium-labeled peptides.
the relative ratios of two h/l ratios ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , except two peptides from csn <dig> whose expected l:m:h ratios in the set <dig> experiment were 5:10: <dig>  the h/l ratios of the peptides of cns <dig> were somewhat lower in the set <dig> experiment than in the set <dig> experiment because the medium-labeled isotopic cluster was much larger than the heavy-labeled isotopic cluster and influenced it .
cause of low abundance of heavy-labeled peptides
std <dig> and std <dig> were labeled with light and heavy mtraq labels, respectively, in set <dig> experiment and vice-versa in set <dig> experiment.
the calculated h/l ratios were lower than the estimated values in both cases, which exclude the possibility of under-digestion of some of the standard mixtures compared to the others.
if then, we would expect reversed h/l ratios between the two experimental sets.
it becomes even more evident if we consider the ms/ms search results in which only one out of  <dig> validated peptides was identified as partially labeled.
the most probable explanation at this point is low labeling efficiency of the heavy reagent.
if we assume that the m/l ratios are correct, we can approximate the h/l ratios in set <dig> experiment using m/l ratios in set <dig> experiment.
similarly, we can approximate the h/l ratios in set <dig> experiment using m/l ratios in set <dig> experiment.
we compared them with the computed h/l ratios and observed that the computed h/l ratios are consistently 50~70% of the approximated h/l ratios except for the cases of cycs in set <dig> experiment .
this result shows the possibility that the heavy reagent had low labeling efficiency.
the origin can also be explained, though in part, by isotope impurity of heavy label.
upon closer inspection of ms spectra of the identified peptides, a peak  <dig> da smaller than the monoisotopic peak of heavy label was frequently found .
it was reported that itraq reagents contain trace levels of isotopic impurities  <cit> .
since mtraq shares the same chemical structure with itraq, we expect that the same problem will happen in mtraq data analysis.
in real experiments where quantification of complex proteome is needed, one can add a known standard at the ratio of 1:1: <dig>  and use the calculated ratio of the standard as a correction factor.
for example, if the calculated ratio of lalba in the current study is used as a correction factor, the ratios of other proteins become closer to the expected ratios.
CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a new data analysis algorithm for peptide quantification in triplex mtraq experiments.
it can calculate the ratios of peptides accurately by separating overlapping triplex isotopic clusters based on the arithmetic models of isotope overlap and an automatic determination for the elution area of peptides.
when used within the tpp pipeline, it can easily analyze high-throughput proteomics data.

",122,"BACKGROUND
introduction of mass spectrometry  provides massive biological information of proteins for both qualitative and quantitative analysis  <cit> . recently, quantitative analyses have become of particular interest in proteomics research  <cit> . to determine the expressional differences of proteins across samples representing different physiological or disease states, various experimental approaches have been developed: spectral counting, stable isotope labeling, and label-free quantification  <cit> .

stable isotope labeling is one of popular methods for protein quantification. peptides of two or more samples are differently labeled using stable isotopes to introduce mass shifts. then they are experimented within a single lc/ms run, so that the sample throughput could be multiplied when compared with that of label-free quantification. there are various labeling techniques: icat  <cit> , silac  <cit> , 18o labelling  <cit> , itraq  <cit> , mtraq  <cit> , and so on. numerous computational tools for the stable isotope labeling have also been developed, including xpress  <cit> , asapratio  <cit> , stem  <cit> , zoomquant  <cit> , msinspect  <cit> , multi-q  <cit> , q <dig>  <cit> , viper  <cit> , maxquant  <cit> , census  <cit> , and iemm  <cit> .

in this paper, we focus on the isotope label mtraq, which is a nonisobaric variant of the itraq and was originally designed for multiple reaction monitoring   <cit> . the mtraq labels were first designed in two chemically identical versions. the heavy-label is identical to the itraq  <dig> label and its mass is  <dig> da. the light-label is chemically identical to the heavy-label, but it has no 13c or 15n, so its mass is  <dig> da. they are labeled at lysine residue and n-terminal. we verified that the mtraq is a powerful isotope label for ms-based relative quantification  <cit> , and developed a new algorithm to improve the accuracy of peptide quantification in mtraq labeling based ms experiments  <cit> . recently, the mtraq has become available in triplex format, where the label with  <dig> da is added.

one of the major obstacles to accurate peptide quantification is the overlap of isotopic clusters. there are two types of overlap problems, one is the overlap between differently labeled peptides, and the other is the overlap between chemically different peptides. the former can happen when the mass difference between labels is very small. in mtraq experiments, the mass difference between differently labeled peptides is  <dig> da if the original peptide has no lysine, so it is important to separate their isotopic clusters correctly. the latter could be found in all kinds of ms-based experiments. for peptide quantification, most of the times we are interested in relative quantification of peptides whose amino acid sequences are known. when we know the sequences of peptides of interest, there are better chances to recognize the overlaps from differential labeling by comparing them to the theoretical isotopic distributions.

in this manuscript, we present a new data analysis algorithm for peptide quantification in triplex mtraq experiments. it is an extension of the algorithm for duplex mtraq experiments  <cit> . we identify isotopic clusters of triplex labeled peptides and separate their intensities using cubic equation modelling when there are overlaps. we also designed an automatic determination algorithm for the elution area of peptides, which could recognize the overlap between chemically different peptides. we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm using standard protein mixture experiments.

materials and methods
preparation of standard samples
three kinds of standard protein mixtures  were prepared for mtraq quantification testing by mixing  <dig> bovine proteins. each mixture consisted of alpha-lactalbumin , beta-casein , serotransferrin , alpha-s1-casein , alpha-s2-casein , cytochrome c  and beta-lactoglobulin  in  <dig> mm tris ph  <dig>  at different amounts as summarized in table  <dig> 

mtraq labeling
the standard protein mixtures were labeled with mtraqtm reagent  as described in  <cit>  and  <cit> . proteins were reduced with  <dig> mm tris  phosphine  for  <dig> hr at  <dig> °c, treated with  <dig> mm methyl methanethiosulfonate  for  <dig> min at  <dig> °c, and then diluted  <dig> fold with  <dig> mm tris , and digested with sequencing-grade trypsin  at  <dig> °c overnight at the protein:trypsin molar ratio of 40: <dig>  tryptic digests were desalted with c <dig> solid-phase extraction cartridge and dried in vacuo. the dried samples were reconstituted in  <dig> mm triethylammonium bicarbonate  and incubated with appropriate mtraq reagents at  <dig> °c for  <dig> hr. for the set <dig> experiment, std <dig> was labeled with mtraq® ∆ <dig> , std <dig> with mtraq® ∆ <dig> , and std <dig> with mtraq® ∆ <dig> . for the set <dig> experiment, std <dig> was labeled with heavy reagent, std <dig> with medium, and std <dig> with light . after the labeling reaction, samples were dried in vacuo, redissolved in  <dig> % trifluoroacetic acid, mixed equally, desalted with a mixed-mode strong cation-exchange  cartridge and dried again.

mass spectrometric analyses of mtraq labeled samples
labeled sample mixtures were reconstituted in  <dig> % acetic acid and an aliquot  was injected to a reversed-phase magic c18aq column  on an eksigent multi-dimensional liquid chromatography  system at the flow rate of  <dig> nl/min. the column was equilibrated with 95% buffer a  +  <dig> % buffer b  prior to use. the peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of  <dig> to 40% buffer b over  <dig> min.

the high performance liquid chromatography  system was coupled to a linear trap quadrupole  xl-orbitrap mass spectrometer . the spray voltage was set to  <dig>  kv, and the temperature of the heated capillary was set to  <dig> °c. survey full-scan ms spectra  were acquired in the orbitrap with  <dig> microscan and a resolution of  <dig>  allowing the preview mode for precursor selection and charge-state determination. ms/ms spectra of the five most intense ions from the preview survey scan were acquired in the ion-trap concurrently with full-scan acquisition in the orbitrap with the following options: isolation width, ± <dig> ppm; normalized collision energy, 35%; dynamic exclusion duration,  <dig> sec. precursors with unmatched and single charge states were discarded during data dependant acquisition. data were acquired using the xcalibur software v <dig> . <dig> .

database searching of ms/ms data for peptide identification
the data files collected on the mass spectrometer  were converted to mgf format by use of trans-proteomic pipeline , which is an open source proteomics analysis tool. the data were then searched using mascot  <cit>   against a compound database consisting of the international protein index  bovine database  and ipi human database  totaling  <dig>  protein entries, allowing the options of trypsin, ± <dig>  da mass tolerance for fragment ion, ± <dig> ppm mass tolerance for precursor ion, variable modifications of mtraq light , mtraq medium  and mtraq heavy  on peptide n-terminus and lys residue. a fixed modification of mmts  on cys residue and a variable modification of met oxidation  were also allowed. tpp was used for the validation of database search results. peptides with tpp peptide probability greater  <dig>  and mascot e-value less than  <dig>  were used for further quantification analysis.

overview of the algorithm
our algorithm is designed to be executed within tpp. for each lc/ms experiment, tpp generates a pepxml file which contains a list of peptides with sequences, tandem scans, charges, and modifications. our algorithm calculates medium to light  and heavy to light  ratios of peptides in pepxml files and produces new pepxml files that can be used for further analysis. for each peptide, our algorithm first determines its elution area. it then identifies triplex isotopic clusters and calculates m/l and h/l ratios for each ms scan contained in the elution area. finally, each of the set of m/l and h/l ratios is integrated based on linear regression.

model of overlapping isotopic clusters
we made a schematic model of overlapping triplex isotopic clusters, which is an extension of the model in our previous work   <cit> . we assumed that an isotopic cluster of a peptide has  <dig> or less peaks. such an assumption is reasonable for peptides whose masses are less than  <dig> da because the relative intensity of the ninth peak in the theoretical distribution of a  <dig> da peptide is only  <dig> % according to an averagine model  <cit> . under this assumption, an overlap exists only if a peptide has no lysine. in this case, the mass difference between labeled peptides is  <dig> da, thus the intensity of the kth peak ik is given as follows:   

where n is the number of peaks in the isotopic distribution of a peptide, lk, mk, and hk are the intensities of the kth peaks of the isotopic distributions of the light, medium, and heavy-labeled peptides, respectively.

let α be the m/l ratio and β be the h/l ratio. for  <dig> ≤ k ≤  <dig>  it is easy to show   

from equation . using equation , we induced three equations         

from equations  and , we obtain a cubic equation for β:   

solving equation , we obtain up to three candidate values for β. then, by substituting the candidates into equation  and solving it, we obtain up to two candidate values for α.  may lead to an abnormal α value because ik+ <dig> could possibly be very small and inaccurate in its value. substituting into equation  could also be problematic because a small value of β could cause an inaccurate α value.) to select the most accurate ratio pair, we define an error function as follows:   

where tk is the intensity of the kth peak of the theoretical isotopic distribution of the peptide.  the error value should be very small for the correct ratio pair because lk+4/lk, mk+4/mk, and hk+4/hk are theoretically the same as tk+4/tk. therefore, we calculated the error value for each candidate pair and select the pair with the lowest error value. after all pairs for  <dig> ≤ k ≤  <dig> are selected, we can calculate the m/l ratio  and the h/l ratio .

determination of the elution areas of peptides
in most lc/ms experiments, tandem ms scans are acquired using dynamic exclusion . for each ms/ms scan, therefore, we know only one ms scan where the identified peptide is eluted. we need to determine the elution area of the peptide as it is eluted over a period of time. however, some peptides have similar atomic masses and elution times, so their elution areas can have overlaps. a naive approach such as using a fixed range  has a risk of including incorrect ms scans where other peptides are overlapped. therefore, it is very important to determine accurate elution areas of the peptides for accurate relative quantification.

we assume that the distribution of peptide elution time can be approximated as a normal distribution. because of noise and overlap of peptides, ms scans with low intensities at both ends of the elution area may not be trusted. if we use only ms scans with high total ion current while modeling the elution profile as a normal distribution, the mean μ of the normal distribution can be approximated, but the variance σ <dig> can’t. instead, we use the full width at half maximum  to induce σ <dig>  from the probability density function of the normal distribution, we deduce  and obtain σ <dig> = fwhm2/ <dig> ln  <dig> 

when a peptide identification and the associated tandem ms scan is given, our algorithm first finds the maximum point of the peptide’s elution profile. for each ms scan within ±30s range from the given tandem scan, it identifies triplex isotopic clusters and calculates the sum of intensities.  the ms scan whose sum of intensities is the highest is selected as the maximum point of the elution area. then it extends the elution area while the sum of intensities of ms scan is above a half of that of the maximum point. the length of the extended area is used as fwhm and weighted average time of scans in the extended area is used as μ. the area with higher intensities than 10% of the maximum intensity in the normal distribution  is used as the elution area of a peptide. an example for approximation to normal distribution is shown in figure  <dig> 

our algorithm calculates m/l and h/l ratios for all ms scans in the elution area. then, each of the set of m/l and h/l ratios is integrated by linear regression using the form “y = cx”. the intensities of peaks are split into the intensity of light-, medium-, and heavy-labeled peptide. we estimate c using the set of intensities of light-labeled peptides as xi’s, and the set of intensities of medium- and heavy-labeled peptides as yi’s for m/l and h/l ratios, respectively.

identification and validation of triplex isotopic clusters
for each ms scan in the elution area, our algorithm identifies isotopic clusters of a target peptide. let mzk be the m/z of the kth peak of an isotopic cluster, then we can calculate three mz1’s corresponding to triplex isotopic clusters from the given sequence, charge z, and modification. our algorithm first finds the monoisotopic peak of each isotopic cluster from mz <dig> within  <dig> ppm error tolerance. then, it finds subsequent isotopic peaks from mzk = mzk-1+  <dig> /z within  <dig> ppm error tolerance. the kth peak is inserted to the isotopic cluster only if the peak improves the least squares fit value . if the lsq between the theoretical distribution of the peptide and the isotopic cluster without the kth peak is lower than that with the kth peak, the kth peak is discarded and the algorithm does not look for any more peaks. if there are two or more candidate peaks for the kth peak, the peak with the lowest lsq is selected. for example, there are two candidates for the third isotopic peak of the light-labeled isotopic cluster of the target peptide and the smaller peak is selected in figure 3a.

after identification of triplex isotopic clusters of a target peptide, we check them and discard the current ms scan if they are doubtful according to the following criteria. first, we check whether the overall shape of each isotopic cluster resembles that of a theoretical isotopic distribution. at least the lsq of the most abundant isotopic cluster must be below a threshold . the lsq of the others should also be below the threshold unless their sums of intensities are lower than a half of that of the most abundant isotopic cluster.  second, we check whether the identified isotopic cluster is overlapped with another peptide. four types of overlaps are shown in figure  <dig>  there is no problem if no isotopic peak is shared by two isotopic clusters . if an isotopic cluster with a different charge value is overlapped, the lsq of the identified isotopic cluster should be significantly high, so we can discard the current ms scan . if an isotopic cluster with the same charge and a higher mass is overlapped, shared isotopic peaks could not be inserted to the isotopic cluster of the target peptide because it increases the lsq of the isotopic cluster . only the case in which an isotopic cluster with the same charge and a lower mass is overlapped needs additional filtering . we can easily detect these overlaps by considering previous peaks, but we can’t separate overlapping isotopic clusters in this case because they look like one isotopic cluster. therefore, we discard the current ms scan if at least one isotopic cluster of a target peptide could be identified as an isotopic cluster with the same charge and a lower mass.

we analyzed two datasets in which seven standard proteins were mixed in different ratios. for the set <dig> experiment, std <dig> was labeled with light, std <dig> with medium, and std <dig> with heavy. for the set <dig> experiment, std <dig> was labeled with heavy, std <dig> with medium, and std <dig> with light. the expected ratios for each experiment are shown in table  <dig> 

we first calculated the averages and standard deviations of log <dig> values of peptides. then, we transformed the averages into h/l scale to compare them to expected ratios.

after validation, we obtained  <dig> ms/ms scans from set <dig> and  <dig> ms/ms scans from set <dig>  resulting in  <dig> unique peptides in total. we calculated m/l and h/l ratios of the peptides and classified them according to the proteins. then we calculated the averages of ratios in individual cases and compared them to the expected ratios . the m/l ratios were generally similar to the expected ratios except csn <dig> and csn1s <dig>  whose ratios were somewhat higher than expected ratios. most h/l ratios were somewhat lower than the expected ratios, but their standard deviations are meaningfully small. we manually inspected the isotopic clusters of these peptides and concluded that the computed ratios are certainly correct despite their discrepancy from the expected ratios. some examples of these cases are shown in figure  <dig>  in spite of our effort to label the samples and to mix them accurately, the mixed ratios of samples may deviate from the expected ratio because of different labeling efficiencies between the labels, and experimental errors such as unequal mixing. average ratio and standard deviation are the two parameters that determine the accuracy of our quantification analysis. unlike the average ratio that is very sensitive to such errors, standard deviation is more inert because the ratios originated from peptides of the same protein should be identical in theory. therefore, the low standard deviations give strong evidence that our computed ratios were accurately determined. figure  <dig> shows the distribution of ratios for lalba. each of m/l and h/l ratios represent similar values. the distributions of ratios for the other proteins are given in supplementary figure s <dig> – in additional file  <dig> 

separation of overlapping triplex isotopic clusters
to verify the robustness of our method for the overlap of triplex isotopic clusters, we prepared set <dig> experiment, in which std <dig> with light and std <dig> with heavy were mixed. in the set <dig> experiment, two isotopic clusters originated from the same peptide have no overlap and their relative ratio can be computed accurately even though the peptide has no lysine. therefore, we can show the robustness of our method by comparing the h/l ratios from the set <dig> experiment to those from the set <dig> experiment. fifteen unique peptides were identified in both experiments and their h/l ratios are shown in figure  <dig>  the h/l ratios in the set <dig> experiment were very close to the h/l ratios in the set <dig> experiment in spite of the interference of the medium-labeled peptides. the relative ratios of two h/l ratios ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , except two peptides from csn <dig> whose expected l:m:h ratios in the set <dig> experiment were 5:10: <dig>  the h/l ratios of the peptides of cns <dig> were somewhat lower in the set <dig> experiment than in the set <dig> experiment because the medium-labeled isotopic cluster was much larger than the heavy-labeled isotopic cluster and influenced it .

cause of low abundance of heavy-labeled peptides
std <dig> and std <dig> were labeled with light and heavy mtraq labels, respectively, in set <dig> experiment and vice-versa in set <dig> experiment. the calculated h/l ratios were lower than the estimated values in both cases, which exclude the possibility of under-digestion of some of the standard mixtures compared to the others. if then, we would expect reversed h/l ratios between the two experimental sets. it becomes even more evident if we consider the ms/ms search results in which only one out of  <dig> validated peptides was identified as partially labeled.

the most probable explanation at this point is low labeling efficiency of the heavy reagent. if we assume that the m/l ratios are correct, we can approximate the h/l ratios in set <dig> experiment using m/l ratios in set <dig> experiment. similarly, we can approximate the h/l ratios in set <dig> experiment using m/l ratios in set <dig> experiment. we compared them with the computed h/l ratios and observed that the computed h/l ratios are consistently 50~70% of the approximated h/l ratios except for the cases of cycs in set <dig> experiment . this result shows the possibility that the heavy reagent had low labeling efficiency.

the origin can also be explained, though in part, by isotope impurity of heavy label. upon closer inspection of ms spectra of the identified peptides, a peak  <dig> da smaller than the monoisotopic peak of heavy label was frequently found . it was reported that itraq reagents contain trace levels of isotopic impurities  <cit> . since mtraq shares the same chemical structure with itraq, we expect that the same problem will happen in mtraq data analysis.

in real experiments where quantification of complex proteome is needed, one can add a known standard at the ratio of 1:1: <dig>  and use the calculated ratio of the standard as a correction factor. for example, if the calculated ratio of lalba in the current study is used as a correction factor, the ratios of other proteins become closer to the expected ratios.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a new data analysis algorithm for peptide quantification in triplex mtraq experiments. it can calculate the ratios of peptides accurately by separating overlapping triplex isotopic clusters based on the arithmetic models of isotope overlap and an automatic determination for the elution area of peptides. when used within the tpp pipeline, it can easily analyze high-throughput proteomics data.

"BACKGROUND
feed is one of the major costs in beef cattle production, accounting for approximately 70 % of total expenditures  <cit> .
as feed price continues to rise due to factors such as human population growth and decreasing amount of arable land  <cit> , beef cattle feed efficiency has become an increasingly important contributor to reduce the cost of production.
recent efforts in the selection of feed efficient cattle have been focused on residual feed intake , a measure of feed efficiency that is independent of growth and body weight  <cit> .
the rfi of an individual is calculated as the difference between actual feed intake and expected feed intake based on maintenance and growth requirements  <cit> .
animals with low  rfi  are considered feed efficient because they consume less feed than expected whereas animals with high  rfi  are feed inefficient due to consuming more feed than expected  <cit> .
selection for l-rfi animals would not only reduce cost of production, but also decrease the environmental footprint because they produce  <dig> and 15 % less methane  <cit>  and manure  <cit> , respectively, than h-rfi animals.
variation in rfi may be due to differences in many biological processes that are influenced by genetic and environmental factors.
physiological processes that have been found to contribute to variation in rfi include those associated with feed intake, digestion, metabolism, activity, and stress  <cit> .
genetic selection and improvement of rfi is possible since rfi is a moderately heritable trait   <cit> , however, the molecular mechanisms underlying rfi are largely unknown.
because variation in rfi is due to differences in many processes, multiple genes from various pathways are likely involved .
discovering differences at the molecular level may potentially lead to identification of biomarkers for use in the selection of l-rfi  animals.
in ruminant animals, such as cattle, the rumen may play an important role in feed efficiency.
it is the main site of microbial feed digestion and fermentation that produces short-chain fatty acids , which are a major energy source for cattle accounting for up to 80 % of total energy requirements  <cit> .
scfas are mainly absorbed from the rumen  <cit>  and metabolized within the rumen epithelium, liver and peripheral tissues to generate energy for use in maintenance, growth and activity  <cit> .
studies have indicated that scfas are absorbed by both simple diffusion  <cit>  and protein-mediated transport through bicarbonate - dependent and - independent mechanisms  <cit> .
moreover, ketogenic enzymes within the mitochondria of the rumen epithelium play a crucial role in the metabolism of scfas, to produce ketone bodies that are an important circulating source of energy throughout the body  <cit> .
differences in the ability of the rumen epithelium to absorb and metabolize scfas may be associated with variation in feed efficiency.
therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate differences in gene expression between the rumen epithelial tissues of feed efficient and inefficient beef cattle using rna-sequencing  technology and bioinformatics.
we hypothesized that the rumen epithelium of l-rfi  animals would have greater expression of genes involved in absorption and metabolism of energetic substrates such as scfas.
methods
animals and rumen tissue collection
hereford x aberdeen angus hybrid steers  were born in the spring of  <dig> and raised at the university of alberta roy berg kinsella research station  in accordance with the canadian council of animal care guidelines  <cit> .
the university of alberta animal care and use committee for livestock approved the experimental protocols .
steers were under feedlot conditions while feed intake data was collected using the growsafe automated feeding system .
the finishing diet was fed for 90 days and was composed of  <dig>  % barley,  <dig>  % oats, 10 % alfalfa pellets, and 5 % feedlot supplement  and  <dig>  % canola oil).
after slaughter, a 4-cm <dig> piece of rumen tissue was obtained from the central region of the ventral sac and rinsed with sterilized pbs buffer  before being placed in a 50 ml tube containing rnalater solution .
the samples were then stored at −80 °c until further processing.
rfi values of all steers were calculated as described by nkrumah et al.
<cit>  and classified as l-rfi , medium rfi , or h-rfi , which have been reported by durunna et al.
<dig>  <cit> .
the rumen epithelial tissues were collected from all animals when they were slaughtered and the rumen epithelia from the most extreme l-rfi  and h-rfi  steers  were selected for transcriptome analysis using rna-seq.
rna extraction and sequencing
after thawing, rumen tissue was placed on a petri dish and papillae  were obtained using sterile scissors and scalpels.
the total rna was extracted from the papillae using mirvana kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
rna integrity of the total rna samples was assessed using the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer  and nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer  was used to measure the concentration and purity.
only samples with rna integrity greater than  <dig> were subjected to rna-seq library construction.
for each of the  <dig> samples, a cdna library was generated from 100 ng of total rna following the protocol of the truseq rna sample preparation v <dig> kit .
first, total rna was fragmented and cdna was synthesized through reverse transcription.
the resulting double-stranded cdna was then subjected to end repair and 3’-end adenylation before ligation of index adapters.
libraries were amplified by 15 cycles of pcr, then validated with the agilent  <dig> tapestation  and quantified with a qubit fluorometer using a qubit dsdna hs assay kit .
the individual indexed libraries were then pooled and sequenced in five lanes on the illumina hiseq  <dig> system at the mcgill university and genome quebec innovation centre  to obtain high-quality, 100-bp paired-end reads .
transcriptome mapping
we used the software package tophat <dig>   <cit>  with bowtie <dig>   <cit>  to align the high-quality rna-seq reads to the bovine reference genome, umd <dig>  .
samtools   <cit>  was used to sort the bam alignment files that were generated from tophat <dig> by name and these sorted bam files were converted to sam files for input to htseq-count   <cit> , which is a software tool that counts the number of reads per gene using the ensembl  bovine gene annotation.
differential gene expression and principal component analysis
differential gene expression analysis was performed using the bioconductor   <cit>  package deseq <dig>   <cit>  in the r statistical software program   <cit> .
firstly, deseq <dig> normalized gene count data using the relative log expression method based on “size factors” to account for rna-seq library size differences and dispersion estimates were calculated.
then, pairwise comparison of expression was made between the l-rfi and h-rfi group for every gene based on a negative binomial model.
fold changes were obtained along with their associated p-values.
the benjamini hochberg method  was used to control the false discovery rate  by adjusting p-values to correct for multiple testing.
a gene was defined as differentially expressed  between the l-rfi and h-rfi group if it had a b-h adjusted p-value  less than  <dig> .
deseq <dig> was also used for principal component analysis  to cluster samples based on gene expression data.
firstly, count data was normalized based on library size and regularized log transformed.
the top  <dig> genes with the most variance  were compared between samples to calculate principal components in order to view clustering in two dimensions.
weighted gene co-expression network analysis
the wgcna r software package   <cit>  was used to identify modules containing genes that are co-expressed and correlated with the rfi trait.
gene expression data was firstly filtered by keeping genes with at least one read in 50 % of the samples, then normalized by count per million reads  and log <dig> transformed ).
removal of the very lowly expressed genes resulted in  <dig>  genes for input to wgcna.
unsigned, weighted correlation network construction and module detection was performed using the automatic one-step function, blockwisemodules.
the resulting gene modules were assigned color names by the software and module-trait relationships were calculated by pearson correlation.
modules with statistically significant  correlations were selected for downstream analysis as potential biologically interesting modules associated with the rfi trait.
additionally, a hierarchical clustering dendrogram of samples and trait heatmap was created using unfiltered, log2cpm data.
sample clustering was based on euclidean distance and the traits used in the heatmap were residual feed intake , dry matter intake , metabolizable energy intake , birth weight , weaning weight , metabolic mid-weight , end weight , carcass weight , and average daily gain .
functional gene annotation
ensembl gene id lists were converted to gene names and symbols using the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery   <cit>  and the r/bioconductor package, biomart   <cit> .
david and ingenuity pathway analysis  were used for functional annotation of de genes and wgcna gene modules.
in david, we examined genes for enrichment in functional categories such as sp_pir_keywords and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways  <cit> .
to correct for multiple testing in david, p-values were adjusted using b-h correction.
biological terms were considered significant if the adjusted p-value was less than  <dig> .
the genes input to ipa were compared to the manually curated ingenuity knowledge base to find significantly enriched canonical pathways, and cellular and molecular processes.
statistical significance  was calculated using the right-tailed fischer’s exact test and b-h corrected for multiple testing.
the identified core transcripts  were input to the protein annotation through evolutionary relationship   <cit>  gene list analysis tool to determine the core functions of the rumen epithelium.
functional classification of genes in categories such as molecular function and biological process was based on gene ontology  annotations.
quantitative real-time pcr  validation of selected differentially expressed genes
to validate the identified de genes from rna-seq, total rna was extracted from rumen papillae of 30 l-rfi samples  and 27 h-rfi samples , respectively.
primers targeting five selected de genes including trans- <dig> -enoyl-coa reductase , cytochrome c oxidase subunit viiia , solute carrier family  <dig> member  <dig> , pyruvate kinase m <dig>  and triosephosphate isomerase  <dig>  were designed using primer-blast , primer express software  or obtained through literatures.
the specificity of primers was checked with blast  and the ucsc in-silico pcr program  <cit> .
table  <dig> lists the housekeeping gene  and the five de genes selected for qpcr validation along with their genbank accession number, primer sequences, product length and functional pathway.table  <dig> gene name, accession number, functional pathway, primer sequences, and product length of qpcr validated genes
all samples were analyzed in triplicate during qpcr using the steponeplus real-time pcr system .
each reaction contained 10 μl fast sybr® green master mix , 1 μl forward primer , 1 μl reverse primer , 7 μl nuclease-free water, and 1 μl cdna template .
the amplification program consisted of preincubation at 95 °c for 20 s followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °c for 3 s and annealing/extension at 64 °c for 30 s. melting curve analysis was performed to confirm single product amplification.
the expression of three housekeeping genes , gapdh , suz <dig> ) was tested in this study using normfinder  <cit>  and proc mixed procedure of sas .
we chose suz <dig> because it was the most stably expressed between and within the two groups.
for each sample, the expression of each targeted gene was presented as Δct, which was obtained by subtracting the average ct  of the suz <dig> housekeeping gene from the average ct of the target gene.
a low ∆ct indicates higher expression and vice versa.
an unpaired t-test in sas  was used to analyze whether a gene showed significant difference between rfi groups.
dna extraction
total dna was extracted and used to quantify the relative mitochondrial genome copy numbers.
the dna was extracted from the rumen papillae  of  <dig> animals  using a bead beating, phenol-chloroform method as described by li et al.,  <dig>  <cit> .
briefly, each sample was placed in a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube containing zirconium beads  and washed twice with 1 ml of tn <dig> buffer  by vortexing and centrifugation at  <dig>  g for 5 min at 4 °c.
the tissue was then resuspended in 1 ml of tn <dig> and the mini-beadbeater- <dig>  was used to mechanically disrupt cells at 5000 rpm for 3 min.
after bead beating, samples were immediately placed on ice and washed two times by phenol and chloroform-isoamyl alcohol .
the dna was then precipitated at −20 °c overnight using cold 100 % ethanol and 3 m sodium acetate.
after precipitation, dna was washed two times with 70 % ethanol and dissolved in 30 μl nuclease-free water.
the dna concentration and quality was measured using nanodrop .
qpcr determination of relative mitochondrial dna copy number per cell
the relationship between rfi and the relative copy number of mitochondrial dna  per cell of the rumen epithelium was performed using correlation analysis.
the ratio of mtdna to nuclear dna  was used to determine the relative copy number of mtdna per cell.
we selected the nd <dig>  gene as the mtdna target  and the single copy, ddx3y  gene as the ndna target .
the nd <dig> primer sequences used to amplify a 200 bp product were 5-gaaccactacgacccgctaca- <dig> , 5-gagttggaagctcagcctgatc- <dig>  and the ddx3y primer sequences used to amplify a 136 bp product were 5-atcgtgggcggaatgagtgt- <dig> , 5-cttggtggaagcggttttga- <dig>   <cit> .
for qpcr, a standard curve was generated for both the mtdna and ndna.
first, pcr was performed on pooled dna to amplify mtdna and ndna separately.
the pcr mix contained 50 ng/μl dna along with 10x pcr buffer, 50 mm mgcl <dig>  10 mm dntp,  <dig> pmol of each primer, taq polymerase, and nuclease-free water to a final volume of 50 μl.
the pcr program consisted of 1 cycle 94 °c for 5 min, 30 cycles of 94 °c for 30 s, 62 °c for 30 s, 72 °c for 30 s and 1 cycle of 72 °c for 7 min with hold at 4 °c.
each pcr product was then subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis in order to excise dna bands for purification using the qiaquick gel extraction kit .
the concentration of the purified mtdna and ndna was measured by nanodrop  and an eight-point standard curve with  <dig> fold dilutions was created for each.
dna copy number of the standard curve points was calculated as described by speicher and johnson   <cit> .
expression of mtdna and ndna within  <dig> samples  was then analyzed by qpcr along with their respective standard curve using an annealing temperature of 62 °c.
dna copy number within samples was extrapolated from the standard curve and all samples and standard curves were analyzed in triplicate.
a one-way anova was performed in sas  to compare rfi groups.
also, a pearson correlation analysis of relative mitochondrial dna copy number per cell and rfi was performed in sas  and r  <cit> .
RESULTS

on average there were  <dig> million high-quality, paired reads generated per sample  from rna-seq and the overall read alignment rate to the bovine reference genome was 85 ±  <dig>  %.
the total number of genes expressed  within the rumen epithelium was  <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig> genes per l-rfi sample and  <dig>  ±  <dig> per h-rfi sample.
there were  <dig>  core genes  among samples and of these core genes,  <dig> can be annotated by panther.

comparison of transcriptome profiles between two rfi groups
the pca plot  shows that l-rfi and h-rfi gene expression profiles seem to fall into distinct clusters, with those from l-rfi animals grouped together.
however, there was a l-rfi outlier sample  that did not cluster with the rest of the samples , which may possibly be related to the animal’s low adg and endwt .
hierarchical clustering by wgcna showed that all the l-rfi samples clustered together while the h-rfi samples did not .
when comparing animals with similar adg and endwt in the trait heat map, l-rfi individuals had lower rfi, dmi and mei than h-rfi individuals.
the means of the two groups for all traits  were compared and there was no significant difference in birthwt, weanwt, mwt, endwt, cwt, and adg.
however, the l-rfi group had significantly  lower rfi, dmi and mei by  <dig>  kg/day,  <dig>  kg/day and  <dig>  mcal/day, respectively.fig.

afold change is gene expression in l-rfi relative to h-rfi
ingenuity analysis of the  <dig> differentially up-regulated genes in l-rfi samples showed that the top significantly enriched canonical pathway was remodeling of the epithelial adherens junctions through endocytosis , degradation , and cytoskeletal organization  .
the other enriched canonical pathways were involved in functions such as protein synthesis , cytoskeletal dynamics, cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis, and migration  .
for the  <dig> de genes that were down-regulated in l-rfi animals, there were no significant canonical pathways.table  <dig> top ingenuity canonical pathways significantly enriched  for up- and down- regulated de genes in l-rfi rumen epithelium

to show the reliability of the differential gene expression analysis of deseq <dig>  we further selected five de genes for validation using qpcr.
as shown in table  <dig>  of these five genes, four  had significantly greater expression  in l-rfi while one  tended to have significantly greater expression .

identification of wgcna gene co-expression modules correlated with rfi
wgcna was conducted to identify gene co-expression modules that are correlated with rfi.
we identified a total of eight co-expressed gene modules with three of them significantly correlated with rfi .
the brown  and green  modules had a significant positive correlation with rfi  while the turquoise module  had a significant negative correlation with rfi .
functional analysis of the genes enriched in the green module did not result in any significantly enriched biological functions or pathways while there was only one significant biological term, which was muscle protein containing four genes in the brown module.
many significant biological functions were identified for the turquoise module with ipa and david analysis  and therefore this study focused on functional examination of the  <dig> genes enriched in this module, which had greater expression in the l-rfi epithelium.fig.
<dig> wgcna identification of rumen epithelial gene modules correlated with the rfi trait.
module names and sizes are shown along with the module-trait relationships indicating the correlation coefficients and p-values.
the strength of the correlation is colored by different intensities of red  and blue .
asterisks indicate modules that are significantly  correlated with rfi
functional analysis of gene module negatively associated with rfi
when functional analysis was performed using david,  <dig> biological functions and  <dig> kegg pathways were significantly enriched for genes in the turquoise module .
the most significant biological functions were acetylation  and phosphoprotein , which are involved in post-translational modification.
many of the other significant biological functions identified were also involved in protein related processes such as protein synthesis , protein biosynthesis ), degradation , threonine protease ), folding ), and transport , protein transport ).
in addition, biological terms associated with energy catabolism ) and anabolism ) were also identified.
kegg analysis of the  <dig> genes within the acetylation category indicated significant involvement of the acetylation related genes in ribosome and proteasome pathways.
these pathways were also significantly enriched in the turquoise module along with oxidative phosphorylation, adherens junction, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and spliceosome .
in the adherens junction pathway, there were  <dig> genes from the turquoise module that may regulate both the strong and weak adhesion between cells .fig.

genes within the turquoise module that have increased expression in the l-rfi rumen epithelium are shown in orange
further functional analysis using ipa showed that the top five most significant molecular and cellular functions for the genes in the turquoise module were protein synthesis, cellular growth and proliferation, post-translational modification, protein folding and cell death and survival .
furthermore, the top canonical pathways were eif <dig> signaling, regulation of eif <dig> and p70s6k signaling, mtor signaling and epithelial adherens junctions remodeling and signaling .
additionally, many genes from the turquoise module are involved in energy generating pathways such as glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid  cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation .
we also found three de genes involved in glycolysis and three associated with oxidative phosphorylation, which were up-regulated in the l-rfi epithelium .

relative mtdna copy number and rfi
the transcriptome analysis results showed up-regulation of genes in the l-rfi epithelium involved in mitochondrial functions such as oxidative phosphorylation.
therefore, we speculated that l-rfi animals would have more relative mtdna copy numbers  in the rumen epithelium than h-rfi animals.
to test this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship between rfi and relative mtdna copy number using a larger population including m-rfi  animals along with l-rfi  and h-rfi  animals.
the correlation analysis showed a significant positive relationship  between rfi and the relative mtdna copy number per cell in the rumen epithelium .
the epithelium of l-rfi animals had 741 ±  <dig>  relative mtdna copy numbers per cell while the epithelium of m- and h- rfi animals had 1104 ±  <dig> and 1000 ±  <dig>  respectively.
there was a significantly greater copy number of mtdna in the rumen epithelium of m- and h- rfi animals compared to l-rfi animals .
however, no significant difference in mtdna copy number was observed between m- and h- rfi animals .fig.

discussion
improving cattle feed efficiency could greatly reduce feed expense and increase profit for producers.
our study of steers divergent in feed efficiency as evaluated by rfi showed that l-rfi individuals are more feed efficient compared to h-rfi individuals because they were able to consume  <dig>  kg less dry matter per day for similar growth, body weight, and carcass weight.
these results coincide with those of others, which found that selection of l-rfi steers with  <dig>  kg per day lower feed intake than h-rfi steers may lead to savings of $ <dig>  per head over a 120-day finishing period and there was no correlation of rfi with growth, body weight and carcass weight  <cit> .
the difference in feed consumption between l- and h- rfi steers for similar production illustrates that differences may exist in the efficiency of feed conversion into energetic substrates, absorption, energy production, and in the distribution of energy for growth, maintenance, and activity requirements.
ruminants utilize the substrates produced by the rumen microbes for their growth.
studies have shown that the rumen microbial community differs between l- and h- rfi steers and may impact feed digestion and fermentation  <cit> .
although, the rumen microbial community has been associated with divergence in rfi, it is unknown whether there are differences in the rumen tissue that contribute to variation in rfi.
our study found that  <dig>  % of the core genes among the rumen epithelial tissues of beef steers are involved in metabolic processes.
indeed, the rumen epithelium was known to be highly metabolic because it contains a high density of mitochondria in the stratum basale layer  <cit>  and metabolizes a large proportion of absorbed scfas  <cit> .
through hierarchical clustering, we found that the whole transcriptome profiles of the rumen epithelial tissues of h-rfi  steers did not cluster together while all l-rfi  steers did.
this indicates that the rumen epithelial transcriptome of h-rfi animals are more variable and there are similarities among the gene expression profiles of l-rfi animals that may be associated with higher feed efficiency.
we speculated that there was greater expression of genes involved in absorption of scfas from the rumen of l-rfi animals.
however, we did not find evidence of differences in the expression of known or candidate scfa transporters belonging to solute carrier  gene families such as slc4a, slc16a , slc21a, slc22a, or slc26a  <cit>  between the l- and h- rfi animals in this study .
although we did not observe differences in the expression of genes encoding scfa transporters, our results do show evidence of differences in the expression of genes that are associated with paracellular permeability, which may impact simple diffusion of scfas and other nutrients.
for example, there were  <dig> genes up-regulated in the l-rfi epithelium involved in the adherens junction pathway, which is important in modulating cell-cell adhesion  <cit> .
these genes encoded the plasma membrane cell adhesion molecules , e-cadherin and nectin, as well as intracellular regulators of these molecules such as p120ctn, v-src, iqgap <dig>  and actb.
cams require attachment to the actin cytoskeleton in order to mediate cell adhesion  <cit> .
additionally, the e-cadherin cam requires interaction with a key regulator, p120ctn, in order to promote strong adhesion between cells  <cit> .
in our study, the l-rfi epithelium had increased expression of the p120ctn regulator, however, there was also increased expression of negative regulators such as v-src and iqgap <dig> that promote weak adhesion.
furthermore, we found several de genes that were up-regulated in the l-rfi epithelium encoding dynamin- <dig> , hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate , and cytoskeletal components , tubulin beta- <dig> , and tubulin alpha-4a ) that are involved in remodeling of epithelial adherens junctions.
this suggests there is increased regulation of intercellular adhesion strength in the l-rfi epithelium.
we also found that regulation of the actin cytoskeleton was a pathway that was up-regulated in the l-rfi epithelium.
the regulation of intercellular adhesion strength and the actin cytoskeleton are vital to many processes such as cell migration, tissue remodeling, and maintenance of tissue integrity  <cit> .
indeed, we found up-regulated de genes  in the l-rfi epithelium involved in several important signaling pathways regulating cell migration including signaling by rho family gtpases, rhogdi, and ephrin b that mediate their effects on cell migration though modulation of intercellular adhesion and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton .
overall, the increased expression of genes related to modulation of intercellular adhesion strength, cytoskeletal organization, and cell migration signaling pathways suggest there is greater cell mobility and dynamic remodeling within the l-rfi epithelium, which may create gaps between cells resulting in greater paracellular permeability for the absorption of nutrients.
therefore, the l-rfi epithelium may potentially have increased paracellular permeability to maximize nutrient absorption in order to compensate for lower feed intake/substrate availability.
future studies are needed to examine the intercellular spaces, cell migration, and nutrient absorption in the rumen epithelium to determine whether they are truly different between steers divergent in rfi.
in addition to greater cell mobility and dynamic remodeling, further evidence from our transcriptome analyses results support that the rumen epithelium of l-rfi animals may have greater tissue morphogenesis compared to h-rfi animals.
tissue morphogenesis is a process that involves changes to the number, shape, size, position, and gene expression of cells in order to develop and maintain a tissue  <cit> .
for instance, we found up-regulation of functions such as cellular growth, proliferation, and death in the l-rfi epithelium, which may indicate increased cell turnover.
there was also up-regulation of protein synthesis, degradation, folding, transport, and post-translational modification processes that suggest increased protein turnover.
future studies to measure rumen papillae density/surface area or rumen volume are necessary to determine whether the l-rfi epithelium has increased tissue morphogenesis and permeability due to a larger surface area to volume ratio.
greater tissue morphogenesis suggests that the l-rfi epithelium may have greater cell growth and proliferation.
this may be due to increased paracellular permeability causing the epithelial cells to be exposed to nutrients at a faster rate.
it is speculated that the difference in the expression of genes involved in tissue morphogenesis could be also associated with the variation in nutrient availability and flux.
l-rfi animals had lower feed intake, suggesting that these animals may have lower microbial products available for the animals.
however, it has been reported that l-rfi animals tended to have a greater concentration of total scfas  in the rumen fluid with significantly greater concentrations of butyrate  and valerate   <cit> .
high concentrations of nutrients are associated with changes in the rumen epithelium such as extensive sloughing of surface epithelial cells, and increased cell migration and proliferation  <cit> .
although the concentration of ruminal scfas was not measured for this study, the lack of difference in the expression of genes associated with scfa oxidation and ketogenesis between l- and h- rfi suggest that the groups of animals may have similar scfa levels in the rumen, although low rfi animals eat less.
on the other hand, in l-rfi animals, nutrient flux may have been increased to maximize absorption because they have less substrate availability by consuming less feed.
regardless, future studies are needed to measure rate of nutrient absorption as well as the concentration of nutrients in the rumen content and epithelium to define their roles in affecting rumen tissue gene expression and in relation to rfi.
while there was no difference in the expression of scfa metabolism genes, we found up-regulation of genes in the l-rfi epithelium involved in energy generating pathways such as glycolysis, tca cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.
the majority of cellular energy, in the form of atp, is generated through oxidative phosphorylation within the mitochondrial inner membrane  <cit> .
our results on increased expression of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation in the l-rfi epithelium suggest that efficient steers may have increased energy production in the rumen epithelium.
this may also indicate higher mitochondrial activity and/or greater mitochondrial genome copy numbers in the rumen epithelium of l-rfi steers compared to h-rfi steers.
rfi was positively correlated , although very weakly, to the mitochondrial genome copy number per cell of the epithelium.
although there were fewer mitochondrial genomes in l-rfi animals, we observed increased expression of mitochondrial genes such as oxidative phosphorylation genes.
this suggests that there is greater transcription from less genomes in the mitochondria of l-rfi animals.
while we could not directly measure mitochondrial activity in our study, others have reported a more rapid rate of oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria of skeletal muscle and the liver in l-rfi beef cattle  <cit> .
we speculate that the mitochondria in the l-rfi rumen may also have the same capability, which needs to be further studied.
overall, increased expression of glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation genes in the l-rfi epithelium suggests increased energy production that provides a resource for the increased tissue morphogenesis occurring to maintain barrier integrity in the l-rfi epithelium, which is an energetically expensive process.
although expensive, we speculate the l-rfi animals have enough energy for other processes throughout the body although they eat less.
future studies on examination of epithelial metabolism and whole body energy balance are needed to support our speculation.
additionally, our study showed significant enrichment of genes in the l-rfi epithelium associated with acetylation, which is a post-translational modification process.
these genes were involved with various processes such as protein synthesis, protein degradation, cytoskeletal organization, metabolism of energetic substrates, and stress response.
this suggests that acetylation modulates genes belonging to a wide range of cellular processes.
acetylation is known to be a metabolically sensitive protein modification process  <cit> .
it is known that approximately 35 % of all mitochondrial proteins are acetylated and the majority of these acetylated proteins are involved in energy metabolism  <cit> .
the expression level of genes encoding proteins that have the potential to become acetylated could be an indicator of the level of energy metabolism occurring within animals.
our results on the increased expression of mitochondrial and metabolic genes suggest greater activity of the enzymes and more energy flow in low rfi animals.
CONCLUSIONS
the rna-seq based transcriptome analysis showed increased expression of genes in the l-rfi epithelium involved in modulation of adherens junctions, cytoskeletal organization, and cell migration signaling pathways that may cause large intercellular gaps and result in greater paracellular absorption of nutrients.
also, the l-rfi epithelium showed increased tissue morphogenesis as characterized by increased expression of genes involved in cell and protein turnover, modulation of intercellular adhesion strength, and cell migration, which may be due to increased absorption rate or a larger surface area to volume ratio.
there was no difference in scfa metabolism; however, there was increased expression of genes associated with glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in the l-rfi epithelium suggesting greater energy production.
the increase in energy production provides a resource for the dynamic processes involved in maintaining tissue barrier integrity.
a limitation of this study was that the epithelial tissue used for rna-seq was obtained from only one location within the rumen.
pooling epithelial samples from multiple locations in the rumen is recommended to provide a better representation of the host transcriptome.
also, the epithelial tissue was acquired from animals only after slaughter.
the transcriptome within animals may vary throughout their life and therefore it would be optimal to obtain epithelial samples from live animals through biopsy at various time points throughout the day and at different ages of the animal.
another limitation was that rumen size/volume and tissue morphology  was not examined, and the concentration and absorption of ruminal scfas could not be measured.
future work is needed to determine whether feed efficient steers truly have increased simple diffusion of scfas through the rumen wall, increased tissue morphogenesis, and increased energy production for the epithelium and for whole body energy use.
regardless, this is one of the first efforts to study rumen epithelium in terms of its function and role in feed efficiency and our results suggest that the rumen epithelium may contribute to variation in rfi through differences in the expression of genes that affect the paracellular transport of nutrients, tissue morphology, and mitochondrial function.
this provides a fundamental understanding on how host gene expression profiles are associated with rfi, which could potentially lead to identification of biomarkers for selection and improvement of cattle feed efficiency.

",863,"BACKGROUND
feed is one of the major costs in beef cattle production, accounting for approximately 70 % of total expenditures  <cit> . as feed price continues to rise due to factors such as human population growth and decreasing amount of arable land  <cit> , beef cattle feed efficiency has become an increasingly important contributor to reduce the cost of production. recent efforts in the selection of feed efficient cattle have been focused on residual feed intake , a measure of feed efficiency that is independent of growth and body weight  <cit> . the rfi of an individual is calculated as the difference between actual feed intake and expected feed intake based on maintenance and growth requirements  <cit> . animals with low  rfi  are considered feed efficient because they consume less feed than expected whereas animals with high  rfi  are feed inefficient due to consuming more feed than expected  <cit> . selection for l-rfi animals would not only reduce cost of production, but also decrease the environmental footprint because they produce  <dig> and 15 % less methane  <cit>  and manure  <cit> , respectively, than h-rfi animals.

variation in rfi may be due to differences in many biological processes that are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. physiological processes that have been found to contribute to variation in rfi include those associated with feed intake, digestion, metabolism, activity, and stress  <cit> . genetic selection and improvement of rfi is possible since rfi is a moderately heritable trait   <cit> , however, the molecular mechanisms underlying rfi are largely unknown. because variation in rfi is due to differences in many processes, multiple genes from various pathways are likely involved . discovering differences at the molecular level may potentially lead to identification of biomarkers for use in the selection of l-rfi  animals.

in ruminant animals, such as cattle, the rumen may play an important role in feed efficiency. it is the main site of microbial feed digestion and fermentation that produces short-chain fatty acids , which are a major energy source for cattle accounting for up to 80 % of total energy requirements  <cit> . scfas are mainly absorbed from the rumen  <cit>  and metabolized within the rumen epithelium, liver and peripheral tissues to generate energy for use in maintenance, growth and activity  <cit> . studies have indicated that scfas are absorbed by both simple diffusion  <cit>  and protein-mediated transport through bicarbonate - dependent and - independent mechanisms  <cit> . moreover, ketogenic enzymes within the mitochondria of the rumen epithelium play a crucial role in the metabolism of scfas, to produce ketone bodies that are an important circulating source of energy throughout the body  <cit> .

differences in the ability of the rumen epithelium to absorb and metabolize scfas may be associated with variation in feed efficiency. therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate differences in gene expression between the rumen epithelial tissues of feed efficient and inefficient beef cattle using rna-sequencing  technology and bioinformatics. we hypothesized that the rumen epithelium of l-rfi  animals would have greater expression of genes involved in absorption and metabolism of energetic substrates such as scfas.

methods
animals and rumen tissue collection
hereford x aberdeen angus hybrid steers  were born in the spring of  <dig> and raised at the university of alberta roy berg kinsella research station  in accordance with the canadian council of animal care guidelines  <cit> . the university of alberta animal care and use committee for livestock approved the experimental protocols .

steers were under feedlot conditions while feed intake data was collected using the growsafe automated feeding system . the finishing diet was fed for 90 days and was composed of  <dig>  % barley,  <dig>  % oats, 10 % alfalfa pellets, and 5 % feedlot supplement  and  <dig>  % canola oil). after slaughter, a 4-cm <dig> piece of rumen tissue was obtained from the central region of the ventral sac and rinsed with sterilized pbs buffer  before being placed in a 50 ml tube containing rnalater solution . the samples were then stored at −80 °c until further processing.

rfi values of all steers were calculated as described by nkrumah et al.   <cit>  and classified as l-rfi , medium rfi , or h-rfi , which have been reported by durunna et al.  <dig>  <cit> . the rumen epithelial tissues were collected from all animals when they were slaughtered and the rumen epithelia from the most extreme l-rfi  and h-rfi  steers  were selected for transcriptome analysis using rna-seq.

rna extraction and sequencing
after thawing, rumen tissue was placed on a petri dish and papillae  were obtained using sterile scissors and scalpels. the total rna was extracted from the papillae using mirvana kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. rna integrity of the total rna samples was assessed using the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer  and nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer  was used to measure the concentration and purity. only samples with rna integrity greater than  <dig> were subjected to rna-seq library construction.

for each of the  <dig> samples, a cdna library was generated from 100 ng of total rna following the protocol of the truseq rna sample preparation v <dig> kit . first, total rna was fragmented and cdna was synthesized through reverse transcription. the resulting double-stranded cdna was then subjected to end repair and 3’-end adenylation before ligation of index adapters. libraries were amplified by 15 cycles of pcr, then validated with the agilent  <dig> tapestation  and quantified with a qubit fluorometer using a qubit dsdna hs assay kit . the individual indexed libraries were then pooled and sequenced in five lanes on the illumina hiseq  <dig> system at the mcgill university and genome quebec innovation centre  to obtain high-quality, 100-bp paired-end reads .

transcriptome mapping
we used the software package tophat <dig>   <cit>  with bowtie <dig>   <cit>  to align the high-quality rna-seq reads to the bovine reference genome, umd <dig>  . samtools   <cit>  was used to sort the bam alignment files that were generated from tophat <dig> by name and these sorted bam files were converted to sam files for input to htseq-count   <cit> , which is a software tool that counts the number of reads per gene using the ensembl  bovine gene annotation.

differential gene expression and principal component analysis
differential gene expression analysis was performed using the bioconductor   <cit>  package deseq <dig>   <cit>  in the r statistical software program   <cit> . firstly, deseq <dig> normalized gene count data using the relative log expression method based on “size factors” to account for rna-seq library size differences and dispersion estimates were calculated. then, pairwise comparison of expression was made between the l-rfi and h-rfi group for every gene based on a negative binomial model. fold changes were obtained along with their associated p-values. the benjamini hochberg method  was used to control the false discovery rate  by adjusting p-values to correct for multiple testing. a gene was defined as differentially expressed  between the l-rfi and h-rfi group if it had a b-h adjusted p-value  less than  <dig> .

deseq <dig> was also used for principal component analysis  to cluster samples based on gene expression data. firstly, count data was normalized based on library size and regularized log transformed. the top  <dig> genes with the most variance  were compared between samples to calculate principal components in order to view clustering in two dimensions.

weighted gene co-expression network analysis 
the wgcna r software package   <cit>  was used to identify modules containing genes that are co-expressed and correlated with the rfi trait. gene expression data was firstly filtered by keeping genes with at least one read in 50 % of the samples, then normalized by count per million reads  and log <dig> transformed ). removal of the very lowly expressed genes resulted in  <dig>  genes for input to wgcna. unsigned, weighted correlation network construction and module detection was performed using the automatic one-step function, blockwisemodules. the resulting gene modules were assigned color names by the software and module-trait relationships were calculated by pearson correlation. modules with statistically significant  correlations were selected for downstream analysis as potential biologically interesting modules associated with the rfi trait. additionally, a hierarchical clustering dendrogram of samples and trait heatmap was created using unfiltered, log2cpm data. sample clustering was based on euclidean distance and the traits used in the heatmap were residual feed intake , dry matter intake , metabolizable energy intake , birth weight , weaning weight , metabolic mid-weight , end weight , carcass weight , and average daily gain .

functional gene annotation
ensembl gene id lists were converted to gene names and symbols using the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery   <cit>  and the r/bioconductor package, biomart   <cit> . david and ingenuity pathway analysis  were used for functional annotation of de genes and wgcna gene modules. in david, we examined genes for enrichment in functional categories such as sp_pir_keywords and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways  <cit> . to correct for multiple testing in david, p-values were adjusted using b-h correction. biological terms were considered significant if the adjusted p-value was less than  <dig> . the genes input to ipa were compared to the manually curated ingenuity knowledge base to find significantly enriched canonical pathways, and cellular and molecular processes. statistical significance  was calculated using the right-tailed fischer’s exact test and b-h corrected for multiple testing.

the identified core transcripts  were input to the protein annotation through evolutionary relationship   <cit>  gene list analysis tool to determine the core functions of the rumen epithelium. functional classification of genes in categories such as molecular function and biological process was based on gene ontology  annotations.

quantitative real-time pcr  validation of selected differentially expressed genes
to validate the identified de genes from rna-seq, total rna was extracted from rumen papillae of 30 l-rfi samples  and 27 h-rfi samples , respectively. primers targeting five selected de genes including trans- <dig> -enoyl-coa reductase , cytochrome c oxidase subunit viiia , solute carrier family  <dig> member  <dig> , pyruvate kinase m <dig>  and triosephosphate isomerase  <dig>  were designed using primer-blast , primer express software  or obtained through literatures. the specificity of primers was checked with blast  and the ucsc in-silico pcr program  <cit> . table  <dig> lists the housekeeping gene  and the five de genes selected for qpcr validation along with their genbank accession number, primer sequences, product length and functional pathway.table  <dig> gene name, accession number, functional pathway, primer sequences, and product length of qpcr validated genes



all samples were analyzed in triplicate during qpcr using the steponeplus real-time pcr system . each reaction contained 10 μl fast sybr® green master mix , 1 μl forward primer , 1 μl reverse primer , 7 μl nuclease-free water, and 1 μl cdna template . the amplification program consisted of preincubation at 95 °c for 20 s followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °c for 3 s and annealing/extension at 64 °c for 30 s. melting curve analysis was performed to confirm single product amplification. the expression of three housekeeping genes , gapdh , suz <dig> ) was tested in this study using normfinder  <cit>  and proc mixed procedure of sas . we chose suz <dig> because it was the most stably expressed between and within the two groups. for each sample, the expression of each targeted gene was presented as Δct, which was obtained by subtracting the average ct  of the suz <dig> housekeeping gene from the average ct of the target gene. a low ∆ct indicates higher expression and vice versa. an unpaired t-test in sas  was used to analyze whether a gene showed significant difference between rfi groups.

dna extraction
total dna was extracted and used to quantify the relative mitochondrial genome copy numbers. the dna was extracted from the rumen papillae  of  <dig> animals  using a bead beating, phenol-chloroform method as described by li et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . briefly, each sample was placed in a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube containing zirconium beads  and washed twice with 1 ml of tn <dig> buffer  by vortexing and centrifugation at  <dig>  g for 5 min at 4 °c. the tissue was then resuspended in 1 ml of tn <dig> and the mini-beadbeater- <dig>  was used to mechanically disrupt cells at 5000 rpm for 3 min. after bead beating, samples were immediately placed on ice and washed two times by phenol and chloroform-isoamyl alcohol . the dna was then precipitated at −20 °c overnight using cold 100 % ethanol and 3 m sodium acetate. after precipitation, dna was washed two times with 70 % ethanol and dissolved in 30 μl nuclease-free water. the dna concentration and quality was measured using nanodrop .

qpcr determination of relative mitochondrial dna copy number per cell
the relationship between rfi and the relative copy number of mitochondrial dna  per cell of the rumen epithelium was performed using correlation analysis. the ratio of mtdna to nuclear dna  was used to determine the relative copy number of mtdna per cell. we selected the nd <dig>  gene as the mtdna target  and the single copy, ddx3y  gene as the ndna target . the nd <dig> primer sequences used to amplify a 200 bp product were 5-gaaccactacgacccgctaca- <dig> , 5-gagttggaagctcagcctgatc- <dig>  and the ddx3y primer sequences used to amplify a 136 bp product were 5-atcgtgggcggaatgagtgt- <dig> , 5-cttggtggaagcggttttga- <dig>   <cit> .

for qpcr, a standard curve was generated for both the mtdna and ndna. first, pcr was performed on pooled dna to amplify mtdna and ndna separately. the pcr mix contained 50 ng/μl dna along with 10x pcr buffer, 50 mm mgcl <dig>  10 mm dntp,  <dig> pmol of each primer, taq polymerase, and nuclease-free water to a final volume of 50 μl. the pcr program consisted of 1 cycle 94 °c for 5 min, 30 cycles of 94 °c for 30 s, 62 °c for 30 s, 72 °c for 30 s and 1 cycle of 72 °c for 7 min with hold at 4 °c. each pcr product was then subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis in order to excise dna bands for purification using the qiaquick gel extraction kit . the concentration of the purified mtdna and ndna was measured by nanodrop  and an eight-point standard curve with  <dig> fold dilutions was created for each. dna copy number of the standard curve points was calculated as described by speicher and johnson   <cit> . expression of mtdna and ndna within  <dig> samples  was then analyzed by qpcr along with their respective standard curve using an annealing temperature of 62 °c. dna copy number within samples was extrapolated from the standard curve and all samples and standard curves were analyzed in triplicate. a one-way anova was performed in sas  to compare rfi groups. also, a pearson correlation analysis of relative mitochondrial dna copy number per cell and rfi was performed in sas  and r  <cit> .

RESULTS

comparison of transcriptome profiles between two rfi groups
the pca plot  shows that l-rfi and h-rfi gene expression profiles seem to fall into distinct clusters, with those from l-rfi animals grouped together. however, there was a l-rfi outlier sample  that did not cluster with the rest of the samples , which may possibly be related to the animal’s low adg and endwt . hierarchical clustering by wgcna showed that all the l-rfi samples clustered together while the h-rfi samples did not . when comparing animals with similar adg and endwt in the trait heat map, l-rfi individuals had lower rfi, dmi and mei than h-rfi individuals. the means of the two groups for all traits  were compared and there was no significant difference in birthwt, weanwt, mwt, endwt, cwt, and adg. however, the l-rfi group had significantly  lower rfi, dmi and mei by  <dig>  kg/day,  <dig>  kg/day and  <dig>  mcal/day, respectively.fig.  <dig> pca plot of the rumen epithelial transcriptomes from cattle with l- and h- rfi. the l-rfi  and h-rfi  samples are plotted along the first two principal components axis

identification of wgcna gene co-expression modules correlated with rfi
wgcna was conducted to identify gene co-expression modules that are correlated with rfi. we identified a total of eight co-expressed gene modules with three of them significantly correlated with rfi . the brown  and green  modules had a significant positive correlation with rfi  while the turquoise module  had a significant negative correlation with rfi . functional analysis of the genes enriched in the green module did not result in any significantly enriched biological functions or pathways while there was only one significant biological term, which was muscle protein containing four genes in the brown module. many significant biological functions were identified for the turquoise module with ipa and david analysis  and therefore this study focused on functional examination of the  <dig> genes enriched in this module, which had greater expression in the l-rfi epithelium.fig.  <dig> wgcna identification of rumen epithelial gene modules correlated with the rfi trait. module names and sizes are shown along with the module-trait relationships indicating the correlation coefficients and p-values. the strength of the correlation is colored by different intensities of red  and blue . asterisks indicate modules that are significantly  correlated with rfi

when functional analysis was performed using david,  <dig> biological functions and  <dig> kegg pathways were significantly enriched for genes in the turquoise module . the most significant biological functions were acetylation  and phosphoprotein , which are involved in post-translational modification. many of the other significant biological functions identified were also involved in protein related processes such as protein synthesis , protein biosynthesis ), degradation , threonine protease ), folding ), and transport , protein transport ). in addition, biological terms associated with energy catabolism ) and anabolism ) were also identified. kegg analysis of the  <dig> genes within the acetylation category indicated significant involvement of the acetylation related genes in ribosome and proteasome pathways. these pathways were also significantly enriched in the turquoise module along with oxidative phosphorylation, adherens junction, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and spliceosome . in the adherens junction pathway, there were  <dig> genes from the turquoise module that may regulate both the strong and weak adhesion between cells .fig.  <dig> kegg pathway for adherens junction. genes within the turquoise module that have increased expression in the l-rfi rumen epithelium are shown in orange



further functional analysis using ipa showed that the top five most significant molecular and cellular functions for the genes in the turquoise module were protein synthesis, cellular growth and proliferation, post-translational modification, protein folding and cell death and survival . furthermore, the top canonical pathways were eif <dig> signaling, regulation of eif <dig> and p70s6k signaling, mtor signaling and epithelial adherens junctions remodeling and signaling .

additionally, many genes from the turquoise module are involved in energy generating pathways such as glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid  cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation . we also found three de genes involved in glycolysis and three associated with oxidative phosphorylation, which were up-regulated in the l-rfi epithelium . the de genes involved in glycolysis were tpi <dig>  =  <dig> ), hk <dig> , and pkm <dig>  while the de genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation were cox8a , atp6ap <dig> , and atp6v0d <dig>  .table  <dig> genes involved in major energy generating pathways with increased expression in the l-rfi rumen epithelium

relative mtdna copy number and rfi
the transcriptome analysis results showed up-regulation of genes in the l-rfi epithelium involved in mitochondrial functions such as oxidative phosphorylation. therefore, we speculated that l-rfi animals would have more relative mtdna copy numbers  in the rumen epithelium than h-rfi animals. to test this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship between rfi and relative mtdna copy number using a larger population including m-rfi  animals along with l-rfi  and h-rfi  animals. the correlation analysis showed a significant positive relationship  between rfi and the relative mtdna copy number per cell in the rumen epithelium . the epithelium of l-rfi animals had 741 ±  <dig>  relative mtdna copy numbers per cell while the epithelium of m- and h- rfi animals had 1104 ±  <dig> and 1000 ±  <dig>  respectively. there was a significantly greater copy number of mtdna in the rumen epithelium of m- and h- rfi animals compared to l-rfi animals . however, no significant difference in mtdna copy number was observed between m- and h- rfi animals .fig.  <dig> correlation scatterplot of rfi and relative mtdna copy number per cell of rumen epithelium . correlation coefficient  =  <dig> , p-value =  <dig> 



discussion
improving cattle feed efficiency could greatly reduce feed expense and increase profit for producers. our study of steers divergent in feed efficiency as evaluated by rfi showed that l-rfi individuals are more feed efficient compared to h-rfi individuals because they were able to consume  <dig>  kg less dry matter per day for similar growth, body weight, and carcass weight. these results coincide with those of others, which found that selection of l-rfi steers with  <dig>  kg per day lower feed intake than h-rfi steers may lead to savings of $ <dig>  per head over a 120-day finishing period and there was no correlation of rfi with growth, body weight and carcass weight  <cit> . the difference in feed consumption between l- and h- rfi steers for similar production illustrates that differences may exist in the efficiency of feed conversion into energetic substrates, absorption, energy production, and in the distribution of energy for growth, maintenance, and activity requirements. ruminants utilize the substrates produced by the rumen microbes for their growth. studies have shown that the rumen microbial community differs between l- and h- rfi steers and may impact feed digestion and fermentation  <cit> . although, the rumen microbial community has been associated with divergence in rfi, it is unknown whether there are differences in the rumen tissue that contribute to variation in rfi.

our study found that  <dig>  % of the core genes among the rumen epithelial tissues of beef steers are involved in metabolic processes. indeed, the rumen epithelium was known to be highly metabolic because it contains a high density of mitochondria in the stratum basale layer  <cit>  and metabolizes a large proportion of absorbed scfas  <cit> . through hierarchical clustering, we found that the whole transcriptome profiles of the rumen epithelial tissues of h-rfi  steers did not cluster together while all l-rfi  steers did. this indicates that the rumen epithelial transcriptome of h-rfi animals are more variable and there are similarities among the gene expression profiles of l-rfi animals that may be associated with higher feed efficiency.

we speculated that there was greater expression of genes involved in absorption of scfas from the rumen of l-rfi animals. however, we did not find evidence of differences in the expression of known or candidate scfa transporters belonging to solute carrier  gene families such as slc4a, slc16a , slc21a, slc22a, or slc26a  <cit>  between the l- and h- rfi animals in this study . although we did not observe differences in the expression of genes encoding scfa transporters, our results do show evidence of differences in the expression of genes that are associated with paracellular permeability, which may impact simple diffusion of scfas and other nutrients. for example, there were  <dig> genes up-regulated in the l-rfi epithelium involved in the adherens junction pathway, which is important in modulating cell-cell adhesion  <cit> . these genes encoded the plasma membrane cell adhesion molecules , e-cadherin and nectin, as well as intracellular regulators of these molecules such as p120ctn, v-src, iqgap <dig>  and actb. cams require attachment to the actin cytoskeleton in order to mediate cell adhesion  <cit> . additionally, the e-cadherin cam requires interaction with a key regulator, p120ctn, in order to promote strong adhesion between cells  <cit> . in our study, the l-rfi epithelium had increased expression of the p120ctn regulator, however, there was also increased expression of negative regulators such as v-src and iqgap <dig> that promote weak adhesion. furthermore, we found several de genes that were up-regulated in the l-rfi epithelium encoding dynamin- <dig> , hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate , and cytoskeletal components , tubulin beta- <dig> , and tubulin alpha-4a ) that are involved in remodeling of epithelial adherens junctions. this suggests there is increased regulation of intercellular adhesion strength in the l-rfi epithelium. we also found that regulation of the actin cytoskeleton was a pathway that was up-regulated in the l-rfi epithelium. the regulation of intercellular adhesion strength and the actin cytoskeleton are vital to many processes such as cell migration, tissue remodeling, and maintenance of tissue integrity  <cit> . indeed, we found up-regulated de genes  in the l-rfi epithelium involved in several important signaling pathways regulating cell migration including signaling by rho family gtpases, rhogdi, and ephrin b that mediate their effects on cell migration though modulation of intercellular adhesion and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . overall, the increased expression of genes related to modulation of intercellular adhesion strength, cytoskeletal organization, and cell migration signaling pathways suggest there is greater cell mobility and dynamic remodeling within the l-rfi epithelium, which may create gaps between cells resulting in greater paracellular permeability for the absorption of nutrients. therefore, the l-rfi epithelium may potentially have increased paracellular permeability to maximize nutrient absorption in order to compensate for lower feed intake/substrate availability. future studies are needed to examine the intercellular spaces, cell migration, and nutrient absorption in the rumen epithelium to determine whether they are truly different between steers divergent in rfi.

in addition to greater cell mobility and dynamic remodeling, further evidence from our transcriptome analyses results support that the rumen epithelium of l-rfi animals may have greater tissue morphogenesis compared to h-rfi animals. tissue morphogenesis is a process that involves changes to the number, shape, size, position, and gene expression of cells in order to develop and maintain a tissue  <cit> . for instance, we found up-regulation of functions such as cellular growth, proliferation, and death in the l-rfi epithelium, which may indicate increased cell turnover. there was also up-regulation of protein synthesis, degradation, folding, transport, and post-translational modification processes that suggest increased protein turnover. future studies to measure rumen papillae density/surface area or rumen volume are necessary to determine whether the l-rfi epithelium has increased tissue morphogenesis and permeability due to a larger surface area to volume ratio. greater tissue morphogenesis suggests that the l-rfi epithelium may have greater cell growth and proliferation. this may be due to increased paracellular permeability causing the epithelial cells to be exposed to nutrients at a faster rate.

it is speculated that the difference in the expression of genes involved in tissue morphogenesis could be also associated with the variation in nutrient availability and flux. l-rfi animals had lower feed intake, suggesting that these animals may have lower microbial products available for the animals. however, it has been reported that l-rfi animals tended to have a greater concentration of total scfas  in the rumen fluid with significantly greater concentrations of butyrate  and valerate   <cit> . high concentrations of nutrients are associated with changes in the rumen epithelium such as extensive sloughing of surface epithelial cells, and increased cell migration and proliferation  <cit> . although the concentration of ruminal scfas was not measured for this study, the lack of difference in the expression of genes associated with scfa oxidation and ketogenesis between l- and h- rfi suggest that the groups of animals may have similar scfa levels in the rumen, although low rfi animals eat less. on the other hand, in l-rfi animals, nutrient flux may have been increased to maximize absorption because they have less substrate availability by consuming less feed. regardless, future studies are needed to measure rate of nutrient absorption as well as the concentration of nutrients in the rumen content and epithelium to define their roles in affecting rumen tissue gene expression and in relation to rfi.

while there was no difference in the expression of scfa metabolism genes, we found up-regulation of genes in the l-rfi epithelium involved in energy generating pathways such as glycolysis, tca cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. the majority of cellular energy, in the form of atp, is generated through oxidative phosphorylation within the mitochondrial inner membrane  <cit> . our results on increased expression of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation in the l-rfi epithelium suggest that efficient steers may have increased energy production in the rumen epithelium. this may also indicate higher mitochondrial activity and/or greater mitochondrial genome copy numbers in the rumen epithelium of l-rfi steers compared to h-rfi steers. rfi was positively correlated , although very weakly, to the mitochondrial genome copy number per cell of the epithelium. although there were fewer mitochondrial genomes in l-rfi animals, we observed increased expression of mitochondrial genes such as oxidative phosphorylation genes. this suggests that there is greater transcription from less genomes in the mitochondria of l-rfi animals. while we could not directly measure mitochondrial activity in our study, others have reported a more rapid rate of oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria of skeletal muscle and the liver in l-rfi beef cattle  <cit> . we speculate that the mitochondria in the l-rfi rumen may also have the same capability, which needs to be further studied. overall, increased expression of glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation genes in the l-rfi epithelium suggests increased energy production that provides a resource for the increased tissue morphogenesis occurring to maintain barrier integrity in the l-rfi epithelium, which is an energetically expensive process. although expensive, we speculate the l-rfi animals have enough energy for other processes throughout the body although they eat less. future studies on examination of epithelial metabolism and whole body energy balance are needed to support our speculation.

additionally, our study showed significant enrichment of genes in the l-rfi epithelium associated with acetylation, which is a post-translational modification process. these genes were involved with various processes such as protein synthesis, protein degradation, cytoskeletal organization, metabolism of energetic substrates, and stress response. this suggests that acetylation modulates genes belonging to a wide range of cellular processes. acetylation is known to be a metabolically sensitive protein modification process  <cit> . it is known that approximately 35 % of all mitochondrial proteins are acetylated and the majority of these acetylated proteins are involved in energy metabolism  <cit> . the expression level of genes encoding proteins that have the potential to become acetylated could be an indicator of the level of energy metabolism occurring within animals. our results on the increased expression of mitochondrial and metabolic genes suggest greater activity of the enzymes and more energy flow in low rfi animals.

CONCLUSIONS
the rna-seq based transcriptome analysis showed increased expression of genes in the l-rfi epithelium involved in modulation of adherens junctions, cytoskeletal organization, and cell migration signaling pathways that may cause large intercellular gaps and result in greater paracellular absorption of nutrients. also, the l-rfi epithelium showed increased tissue morphogenesis as characterized by increased expression of genes involved in cell and protein turnover, modulation of intercellular adhesion strength, and cell migration, which may be due to increased absorption rate or a larger surface area to volume ratio. there was no difference in scfa metabolism; however, there was increased expression of genes associated with glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in the l-rfi epithelium suggesting greater energy production. the increase in energy production provides a resource for the dynamic processes involved in maintaining tissue barrier integrity. a limitation of this study was that the epithelial tissue used for rna-seq was obtained from only one location within the rumen. pooling epithelial samples from multiple locations in the rumen is recommended to provide a better representation of the host transcriptome. also, the epithelial tissue was acquired from animals only after slaughter. the transcriptome within animals may vary throughout their life and therefore it would be optimal to obtain epithelial samples from live animals through biopsy at various time points throughout the day and at different ages of the animal. another limitation was that rumen size/volume and tissue morphology  was not examined, and the concentration and absorption of ruminal scfas could not be measured. future work is needed to determine whether feed efficient steers truly have increased simple diffusion of scfas through the rumen wall, increased tissue morphogenesis, and increased energy production for the epithelium and for whole body energy use.

regardless, this is one of the first efforts to study rumen epithelium in terms of its function and role in feed efficiency and our results suggest that the rumen epithelium may contribute to variation in rfi through differences in the expression of genes that affect the paracellular transport of nutrients, tissue morphology, and mitochondrial function. this provides a fundamental understanding on how host gene expression profiles are associated with rfi, which could potentially lead to identification of biomarkers for selection and improvement of cattle feed efficiency.

","BACKGROUND
feed efficient cattle consume less feed and produce less environmental waste than inefficient cattle. many factors are known to contribute to differences in feed efficiency, however the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. our study aimed to understand how host gene expression in the rumen epithelium contributes to differences in residual feed intake , a measure of feed efficiency, using a transcriptome profiling based approach.


RESULTS
