 this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us . 
 that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ? 
 it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth . 
 i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long . 
 i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada .

"so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke 
 i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award 
 yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their "" home grown "" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out . 
 i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to 
 sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ? 
 i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ? 
 a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting .. 
 there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence 
 you know there 's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition , and so the programs have jazz - like harmonies . as a computer guy , i find that pretty fascinating . so , you ever been to a live concert ? ( jazz or otherwise ? ) 
 that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though . 
 it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music ! 
 i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii 
 wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those "" eccentric rock and roll musician "" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ... 
 it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters 
 well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ? 
 now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit

 ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military 
 i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe 
 ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion

"do you still use a landline ? 
 no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines . 
 yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables . 
 even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ? 
 we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures . 
 less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ? 
 youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular . 
 true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ? 
 i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often . 
 i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like "" how to "" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following . 
 it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility . 
 agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success . 
 do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ? 
 i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street . 
 it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase . 
 it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras .

 are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status

 not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books 
 well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me 
 true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years

 considering he donated 32,000 books , i 'm going off the assumption that the venture took him several trips
